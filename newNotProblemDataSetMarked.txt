noProblem Of what code is available in the zip file, most of it is understandable. The devise gem seems unnecessary to their implementation however.
noProblem Github link is not submitted. I downloaded the repo and It has barely 4 commits with basic scaffolds and schema generated for realtors and houses  
noProblem The link seems to be a local deployment.
noProblem All tests in the zip file are scaffold generated.
noProblem Yes, the house controller has been tested.
noProblem No testing has been done apart from the auto-generated tests.
noProblem The zip posted doesn't seem to be updated again later after 1st Oct
noProblem Yes, the controllers have been properly tested.
noProblem There are 24 commits done, however all have been made on one day.

noProblem  No, there has been only one commit on 10/01.
noProblem All the changes were pushed on a single day. the last day of submission.
noProblem Interface is very basic It lacks in many major functionalities that made the navigation through the site difficult. README was not well described to understand the team's work and their functionalities.
noProblem The ruby coding convention has been followed through out the project.
noProblem The MVC structure is good, but some details should  be improved.
noProblem  Yeah in a way. The scaffolding generated code follows convention.
noProblem The code follows the common "Ruby on rails" application structure: Hence, it was easy for me to navigate through other files to see portion of the code. It follows the common MVC structure. However, In some parts of the code, comments were missing which was confusing as I didn't understand the logic for that code. README file was not properly described for other users navigating through app.
noProblem The controllers are well-written.
noProblem The code follows "good Ruby and Rails coding practice" from my point of view.
noProblem Have used DRY principles. The code has good readability and good naming conventions are followed. Have grouped similar functionalities into classes so that it is modularized. Have used iterators such as each instead of for and while.
noProblem UI/UX is awesome and intuitive. Read me file is also well described.
noProblem The user interface is easy to use and the README file is explicit.
noProblem Great UI. Admin dashboard looks very professional.
noProblem Yes you have the tests written.
noProblem The basics test are written. Some application specific tests can be written.
noProblem Requesting to GIT Link to verify the same

noProblem The MVC structure is completed. and basic functions have been finished.
noProblem the interface is good, clean and very easy to use.
noProblem They are simple links to pages which does tell you where to go so it's fine.
noProblem The UI is elementary but intuitive. The links have long descriptive names
noProblem Yes it is deployed on Heroku.
noProblem Yes, the team seems to have tested their UsersController completely that handles login, logout and other user signin validations
noProblem The code was presumable uploaded in the end (pushed from another repo) and hence I could not see any regular commits.
noProblem In total, there are only 3 commits done!
noProblem The ruby coding convention has been followed through out the project.
noProblem  Yeah in a way. The scaffolding generated code follows convention.
noProblem No, not really. The website just has one role to operate, and the readme file is an auto-generated file, which doesn't include any useful information.
noProblem Yes, the controllers have been properly tested.
noProblem  There are some tests for the controllers, but it looks like just the scaffold generated tests.
noProblem only the default testcases created by the command are present in the repository.

noProblem Basic scaffold generated tests available.
noProblem Yes, from what I could see, they have done well in testing at least one model and one controller.
noProblem Team has perfectly implemented major modules and also they have implemented the extra credit portion. I tried to login with invalid credentials or some invalid password-email-phone lengths: but there were validations. Hence, they have perfectly focused on this parts too and tested it.   I believe this has implemented a through test of at least one module and controller.
noProblem Several linear commits with good explanations available.
noProblem Tem has properly used Git and only pushed the changes when necessary and also, consistently throughout the project period.
noProblem Well written code.
noProblem Not a lot of code to begin with but whatever is there seems by coding practice norms. Most of the code seems to be commented

noProblem Yes, the team kept pushing changes throughout the project period
noProblem There was consistent commits with a spike in between when probably most development happened
noProblem looking at your commit history, you guys started it on Saturday when the submission was Monday.
noProblem The website did not seem to work at first. Now I was able to access it. I also noticed some features that were included in the meantime like testing by adding house hunters. Overall, the team did work on updating the site functionalities. 
noProblem The Git repo shows total of 15 commits. Although majority of the places Ruby Standards have been followed but at some places variables names such as (househunter_url) does not show any relavancy or understandidng to the reader. If the variable is pointing to a function or belongs to, for example it can be house_hunt_xyz. Overall I think good standards are being followed. 
noProblem Yes we can see many pushes on git. Hence , they have updated code.
noProblem Timely commits and elaborated readme file.

noProblem Yes, the code does follow Ruby and Rails practices to an extent, as I can see the use of many helper methods in the code.
noProblem Most files seem to be following good Ruby and Rails practices.
noProblem Did a good job using forms to stay dry with the edit and new pages. Some more comments especially in the models would have been helpful to understand why certain validations were chosen. The use of JSON to store and recall in views was clever.
noProblem yes. It is well written and they managed to follow DRY principle.
noProblem Code follows the basic CRUD structure given by Rails and neatly explains what is being performed. The notices nicely explains the user what is happening. The db schema is designed to incorporate most of the requirements.
noProblem Reviewed the Git code for all controller , models and views . standard ruby coding practices have been followed and code is easily readable

noProblem 16 commits in last 11 days implies have been pushing code frequently
noProblem  The repo has many commits contributed by the teammates throughout  the project period
noProblem I found many commits throughout the project period about fixing bugs, add new features and update readme.   
noProblem User interface is very nice and well-organized.
noProblem readmd has all important required details.
noProblem This application is deployed on Heroku, and the user interface is easy to understand and use.
noProblem  The code is neat and concise with required comments and messages for all the changes

noProblem Very nicely written code. DRY principles used nicely. Formatting is also done very nicely.
noProblem Code looks, as they say, 'hella fresh'. Very clean, from the files I looked over.
noProblem The team has used excellent Ruby standards coding practice. Controller as well as Model has variable names which are self explanatory. 
noProblem The code on Git has good readability with proper indentation and naming conventions. Similar functionalities have been combined together into a class like, in the case of PotentialBuyerController. The use of a single User model and role based authentication has certainly DRY'd up the code. One possible alternative to further DRY up the code, is that in many controllers like in the case of users_controller, every method is storing the list of real estate companies in an instance variable @real_estate_companies. So, in this case a callback like before_action can be used to save the real estate companies in @real_estate_companies variable, so that all methods have access to it.  The use of appropriate iterators instead of looping constructs like for and while follows Ruby's good coding practices. Every controller serves a specific purpose and the use of a common welcome_controller and its associated views has again modularised the code for easy extensibility. 
noProblem Ruby Rails code standards are correctly followed. And code is committed properly.

noProblem In general, UI was great. The site looks really clean, and the buttons did what I expected them to do.
noProblem User interface is well organized and easy to use.
noProblem Highly intuitive user interface. Properly states admin as well as new user login. The navebar shows the logged in user as well as log out options. Very easy to user and understandable. 
noProblem Yes The UI is interactive and easy to use.
noProblem Modules have test cases.
noProblem yes, at least one controller and one model have been tested.
noProblem Two tests have been implemented and working. 
noProblem Hunters functionalities are working properly.
noProblem The team used multiple development branches and a master branch along with frequent commits to stay in sync.
noProblem  
noProblem yes, the team keep on pushing their changes.
noProblem Yes, there are periodic commits and the messages are very descriptive.
noProblem Starting on September 22nd and going up through today! 100+ commits is great.
noProblem Yes, the team kept pushing changes throughout the project period
noProblem A total of 105 commits. Consecutive update done on Github. 
noProblem The team has started to work on the project from Sept 16th and has regularly pushed their commits to the repository. Both the team members have been actively contributing to the project. A total of 58 commits have been made so far and the project is progressing at a very good rate.
noProblem I could see commits made my team members in timely manner.
noProblem The user interface is very intuitive. I like the modern look and feel of the UI as well as the icons and images. It's quite professional. Excellent work! The various buttons are in good locations. The button text could be darker, however. The "new user" link could be made into a bigger button, which would make it more prominent. Right now it is hard to see.
noProblem the interfce is very good, clean and very easy to use.
noProblem Very nice UI, great UX. Great use of material design icons and bootstrap. Enjoyed using the website. Great job!
noProblem In general, UI was great. The site looks really clean, and the buttons did what I expected them to do.
noProblem User interface is well organized and easy to use.
noProblem Highly intuitive user interface. Properly states admin as well as new user login. The navebar shows the logged in user as well as log out options. Very easy to user and understandable. 
noProblem The User interface is very appealing. The show view is especially remarkable that makes good use of the attractive classes of CSS and Bootstrap. The navigation links provided in every page are very helpful to explore the website. The switch user capability makes it easy for users to switch between roles without the hassle of logging out and logging in again. One issue that I encountered was that the inquiries controller has not been fully implemented, which lands the website into an error page. 
noProblem The testing was thorough, although one model and one controller individually did not appear to be tested thoroughly.
noProblem yes, at least one controller and one model have been tested.
noProblem Some test cases are missing for complicated flows like Real Estate Company should only be deleted when there are no realtors assigned.
noProblem The inquiry controller was thoroughly tested, but none of the models appear to have the same amount of testing.
noProblem Two tests have been implemented and working. 
noProblem The team has not yet started to test their models (unit test) and controller (functional and integration test). Test driven development (TDD) is a good strategy to test the application features before and during the application development phase. By using TDD, it is possible to anticipate the potential pit falls and corner cases, before starting to address the code to tackle those.
noProblem The team used multiple development branches and a master branch along with frequent commits to stay in sync.
noProblem yes, the team keep on pushing their changes.
noProblem Yes, there are periodic commits and the messages are very descriptive.

noProblem it has a good structure, choice of names of the files is appropriate and readable
noProblem No
noProblem Realtor user can perform basic functionalities.
noProblem Yes. we could see updated git. Hence i can conclude that they are updating code regularly. 
noProblem Somewhat. Since I can see the commits were made in 2 days only
noProblem There were 24 commits in 6 days which means that they have been working in last few days and have been doing check-in regularly since they started work.
noProblem  I can see 28 commits , which is descent
noProblem Code follows general Ruby guidelines and is formatted in a legible manner.
noProblem The ruby code is precise and the project follows a proper structure with all the required files.
noProblem Yes, the team has included tests for controller, model, and have also implemented integration tests. 
noProblem Yes, their commits started from September. They have been working on the project for the entire period.
noProblem There is no external  link provided to the application

noProblem very inconvenient for me to review without a deployed version! 
noProblem The code is as per coding practices. Nice first attempt.
noProblem Looks good to me. The Ruby DRY code approach is followed throughout.
noProblem easy to understand.
noProblem Yes, it is very intuitive and easy to use.
noProblem test cases are generated through scaffold.
noProblem only controller tested
noProblem The team has not implemented a testing module as of yet.
noProblem Test skeletons are present. Doesn't look like tests are added yet.
noProblem committed throughout the period to avoid merge conflicts.
noProblem yes, timely pushing of code and creation of branches to avoid merge conflict
noProblem The team has a well documented history of commits for the code repository
noProblem You guys started pretty late. But overall great effort. Great UI.
noProblem good coding style.
noProblem Overall the following things can be improved: 1) The primary key for the real estate company should be auto generated. This is done automatically by the rails framework, so maybe you can remove the code from the view which asks for the user to select the primary key while creating a company. 2) Whenever there is a reference to a foreign key in a model, you can validate and use that reference by following the format model_id, where model is the entity of your foreign key. Eg. If house has foreign key of realtor, realtor is the entity of your foreign key, hence you can reference the realtor as realtor_id in your house model. This is because rails follows convention over configuration, and this is the naming convention with respect to foreign keys.
noProblem Navigation between pages is not defined well. 
noProblem Deployed on Heroku. Interface is not friendly, but thr README file explained some of it.
noProblem Decent coding practice
noProblem The app's indentation, method names, and line separation seem to match solid Ruby style guidelines.
noProblem From what I see it seems to be following the practice we have been using in class
noProblem  Yes, the source code follows expected RoR style. The directory names and project structure also follow RoR conventions. Good job!
noProblem Good Rails coding practice has been implemented. In Model as well Controller we can see variables names that shows the relation to overall module and model.

noProblem It appears minimal controller testing has been performed.
noProblem No testing, but at least they mentioned it in the readme.
noProblem The team used mutliple branches and many commits throughout the project to increment on the codebase.
noProblem  They have a lot of commits so they were always working on it
noProblem Yes, it looks like sizable commits were made before the 24th.
noProblem Yes 95 commits. 
noProblem The interface is good, and the README provides good documentation.
noProblem Couldn't find any issues respective to Style Guidelines
noProblem There were 9 commits overall in the GIT
noProblem The user interface is quite intuitive to use. I had a very minor suggestion. I found a case where the go back link was missing and thus, I had to click on the dashboard link to go back. Ex. After I click on view companies, there's no go back link.  Overall, I feel you did a really good job. For example, while switching the role, you gave an option to edit the roles as well. As well as a delete account functionality. 
noProblem Very nice code, and almost every functions that test required are finished.
noProblem the interface is easy to use and it is wll described in the Readme file.
noProblem Good set of directions in readme.

noProblem The UI is good and intuitive. Good use of colors and html features.
noProblem Yes, tests are done for many models and controllers.
noProblem Yes there are lot of commits over many days from multiple contributors
noProblem Yes, there are many commits which added new features and fixed some bugs. 
noProblem Yeah, they have done the project with even number of commits throughout the duration.
noProblem Code is written properly and followed ruby framework with MVC architechure. Also added various packages.
noProblem Basic Practices were followed Reusability of code is maintained and the code is well intended
noProblem it has a good structure, choice of names of the files is appropriate and readable
noProblem No
noProblem Realtor user can perform basic functionalities.
noProblem Yes. we could see updated git. Hence i can conclude that they are updating code regularly. 
noProblem Somewhat. Since I can see the commits were made in 2 days only
noProblem There were 24 commits in 6 days which means that they have been working in last few days and have been doing check-in regularly since they started work.
noProblem  I can see 28 commits , which is descent
noProblem Well written code following coding practices.
noProblem Ruby coding convention has been followed almost throughout the project.
noProblem All practices were followed
noProblem Code looks good. Use comments wherever necessary.
noProblem Coding standards are fairly good.
noProblem A model has been thoroughly tested.
noProblem Constant changes were being made.
noProblem Yes, there are 24 commits done over a span of 13 days.
noProblem Team was proactive in working together.
noProblem Code commit frequency is fairly good.
noProblem The code is very neat and easy to read, but i can tell it is the auto generated code from scaffold. 
noProblem The application is deployed on Heroku, and the user interface is easy to use.
noProblem No roles implemented. 
noProblem No, none of the controllers or models have been tested.
noProblem Actually i did find some auto generated test code for the controllers, but i don't think it is a thoroughly test. And there is no test code for the model.
noProblem total of 10 commits are visible on got but do not show a linear increment in the work done.
noProblem Yes. Good effort in case of pushing changes
noProblem No updates since 6 days ago
noProblem Only on 2 days all together
noProblem Total of only 10 commits has been made on 3 days.
noProblem I looked through their github commits log, and found that their first commit is on Sep 28,2018. Maybe their just began to do the project on Sep 28?
noProblem The application is deployed on Heroku, and the user interface is easy to use.
noProblem Basic Tests are present. Not custom tests though
noProblem total of 10 commits are visible on got but do not show a linear increment in the work done.
noProblem Yes. Good effort in case of pushing changes
noProblem No updates since 6 days ago
noProblem Only on 2 days all together
noProblem Total of only 10 commits has been made on 3 days.
noProblem I looked through their github commits log, and found that their first commit is on Sep 28,2018. Maybe their just began to do the project on Sep 28?
noProblem The code follows mvc architecture and practices in an organized way
noProblem Even though the codebase is not large, Ruby and Rails standards such as naming conventions, file structure, and the correct usage of MVC pattern are followed.
noProblem The user interface looks intuitive, as it has options for signing up with different roles
noProblem They have tested for the models and controllers constructed.
noProblem Seem to be following standard practices.
noProblem Yes, the code has the parameters well defined for all the users and has the correct MVC Layout as expected.  For instance, they seem to have created separate MVC architectures for Houses, Inquiries, Interests, Companies and Users. This goes to show that they have a layered approach on access and privileges.  Also, the code is written in a very clean and formatted style with the variable definitions to be self-explanatory of the functionalities they perform. 
noProblem Good job done here! You have listed the features available to test.
noProblem The app is deployed very well and is very easy to use.
noProblem All the basic features implemented for admin,house hunter and realtor is functional.  
noProblem There are 67 commits made during the tenure of the project by all the team members. The team has worked on git since the start of the project.
noProblem Yes, 67 commits. It seems they have been pushing changes regularly
noProblem Yes, the commits were regular. After the project was assigned, there were several commits on a weekly basis, and as the deadline neared, the frequency of the commits kept increasing in an orderly manner. There was no last minute rush, and the development of the project seemed pretty well planned.
noProblem Yes, as seen from the number of commits on each section of their GitHub profile, not only have they meticulously made a number of changes on Repo, but they have also updated what all changes they made against the files. This is a very neat practice in my opinion and shows that they have put ample effort to structure the code. Moreover, they have updates the GemFile multiple times so as to make it run for the Heroku app which is a must thing to do and a challenge we faced too. 
noProblem Yes, there are git commits and pushes after initial commit as well.
noProblem No, not really. No user type has all the functionality in this review's check boxes, much less all the functionality specified in the project description. Manual inspection of the test folder reveals that all the model and controller tests are empty, as are the fixtures.
noProblem I cannot appraise this because I do not believe they did their development in the linked repo. There is only one commit, where all the functionality was added. I am inclined to say the team was not actively developing over the project period.
noProblem The model and controller are well designed. Each method covers a single functionality! Good job
noProblem All users have their own model controllers. The code is following Ruby on Rails standards but there are some debug "puts" that should be removed.
noProblem Yes it is deployed on Heroku.
noProblem Most of the practices have been followed
noProblem The ruby source code appears to follow RoR conventions, and uses a few Rails associations. The directory names and project structure appear to follow good RoR MVC conventions. Source code is organized and uncluttered too.
noProblem The code is neat and precise with proper structure and comments
noProblem Very good structure, readable and names are very relevant to the functionality
noProblem The code is written really well.
noProblem Controller has been tested  
noProblem extensive testing was done

noProblem It is done well and I can say it is a indeed a good ruby and rails coding practice
noProblem Yes
noProblem I have seen they keep updating the github
noProblem There were changes pushed to the branch throughout the project period.
noProblem  No, the initial commits were made the Thursday before the 1st submission was do. It is great to see additional commits since the 1st submission!
noProblem The first commit for the project was made only 4 days before the deadline. since then the team kept continuously pushing their changes.
noProblem I can see 28 commits with a good distribution over the time span.
noProblem Yes we can see many pushes on git. Hence , they have updated code.
noProblem Timely commits and elaborated readme file.
noProblem The code is clear and concise, it does follow good Ruby and Rails coding practices.
noProblem Yes, the code does follow Ruby and Rails practices to an extent, as I can see the use of many helper methods in the code.
noProblem Yes. I am able to login into the system via the link provided.
noProblem They have attached 2 other files saying what all they have implemented.
noProblem Everything was described properly in the README file.
noProblem Yes 
noProblem All the tests are auto-generated.
noProblem The team all had multiple commits throughout the course of the project.
noProblem Yes i could see multiple pushes.  
noProblem The team has been pushing changes since around 12 days ago, and the project structure feels well planned with some changes and testing required.
noProblem They have 195 commits. Ui is great, everything is running smoothly.
noProblem The project was continuously updated during the past two weeks.
noProblem Git shows too many changes which are not required. One can test thoroughly before submitting the changes.
noProblem Code commit frequency is fairly good.
noProblem The code follows common ruby rails guidelines
noProblem Have used DRY principles. Follows good coding practices.
noProblem Yes the UI is good and easy for navigation, usage.
noProblem The UI is good and intuitive. Good use of colors and html features.
noProblem Yes, there are many commits which added new features and fixed some bugs. 
noProblem Yes there are lot of commits over many days from multiple contributors
noProblem Yeah, they have done the project with even number of commits throughout the duration.
noProblem Yes, tests are done for many models and controllers.
noProblem The code seems to be following the examples in cookbook app.
noProblem  The source code and project structure seems fine, but most of it still looks scaffold generated. RoR conventions have been maintained.
noProblem Yes. Timely commits with comments.
noProblem The code written was clear and I believe that it follows good Ruby and Rails coding practices to a certain extent.
noProblem It is done well and I can say it is a indeed a good ruby and rails coding practice
noProblem I dd not find the link. I viewed the code on Github, it seems work. 
noProblem Yes
noProblem I have seen they keep updating the github
noProblem There were changes pushed to the branch throughout the project period.
noProblem  No, the initial commits were made the Thursday before the 1st submission was do. It is great to see additional commits since the 1st submission!
noProblem The first commit for the project was made only 4 days before the deadline. since then the team kept continuously pushing their changes.
noProblem I can see 28 commits with a good distribution over the time span.
noProblem The app's indentation, method names, and line separation seem to match solid Ruby style guidelines.
noProblem Decent coding practice
noProblem From what I see it seems to be following the practice we have been using in class
noProblem  Yes, the source code follows expected RoR style. The directory names and project structure also follow RoR conventions. Good job!
noProblem The code base is very well written and commented. The code has been done with good coding practices. The only point to note would be to update the Readme to be more informative.
noProblem Good Rails coding practice has been implemented. In Model as well Controller we can see variables names that shows the relation to overall module and model. 
noProblem The user interface is nice. I suggest you move the search button in the houses screen to the left. Also, "yes" and "no" would probably be more user-friendly than "true" and "false" for the basement condition. The new user window was very intuitive and powerful. Note: I found a bug in this window: changing the admin account with "REALTOR" checked causes an error. The error screen was graceful, however. Also, please use radio buttons for "HUNTER" or "REALTOR", not checkboxes. Please also include the type of the user in the users window.
noProblem  UI is easy to use, but not well described in the README. Please add brief Test Cases to demonstrate expected functionality.
noProblem The interface is basic and no extra styling is done. But overall the web application is easy and intuitive to use. The Read me  file of the github repo should be updated to make it more   detailed to use.  
noProblem The interface is intuitive. Specially, they have very good form structure for realtor as well as new users, and house hunters. 
noProblem No they have not. They said they will for the final submission
noProblem The team used mutliple branches and many commits throughout the project to increment on the codebase.
noProblem While the team did push changes to the project, there are 95 commits which are unnecessary. Instead of pushing every change to the final project, the team could have combined a few of the changes and pushed them all at once to make for better record of the changes made.
noProblem Teams looks fairly active but the project progress does not correspond to the number of commits made in the git repository
noProblem  They have a lot of commits so they were always working on it
noProblem Yes, it looks like sizable commits were made before the 24th.
noProblem Yes 95 commits. 
noProblem The code is very well written and organised. All the framework conventions have been followed such as the naming conventions. Comments have been added at appropriate places which improved the readability.
noProblem yes. code is written properly. followed dry principle. added comments where possible. followed mvc with rails framework.
noProblem It does well to follow the "good Ruby and Rails coding practices". It follows the DRY code approach.

noProblem yes. User Interface is good and easy to access.
noProblem Excellent commit history. Contributions from all team members could be seen.
noProblem Yes, the team kept pushing changes throughout the project period
noProblem The website did not seem to work at first. Now I was able to access it. I also noticed some features that were included in the meantime like testing by adding house hunters. Overall, the team did work on updating the site functionalities. 
noProblem The code seems very good. And the code is very clearly.
noProblem The Git code did follow the good coding practices using Ruby and Rails. 
noProblem All files they provided are clearly structured, especially for the routes file. They provide clear routes for different conditions.
noProblem For all user, sign up and log in should at the same place.
noProblem The UI had good directives between operations, functionalities and was easy to use. The admin profile was available in the README file.
noProblem Yes, it is.
noProblem Code seems to follow the Ruby Practices.
noProblem Code is written in a clean and readable way. There are separete methods for separate tasks.  Good naming convention is followed throughout the project.
noProblem recompany could have been just company
noProblem The team seems to have attempted to add to their functionality from the previous round. They have attempted to use the devise gem for allowing multiple user logins. It seems that they created a new git repo and started from the beginning which seems like a fair idea given that they wanted to use devise instead of implementing the user registration/sessions. 
noProblem Yes, they have keep commit to git as their project been working. 
noProblem The team submitted their changes towards the end of the project. They committed changes in round 2.
noProblem Yes, there is a "has_many" relationship in company model, and also realtor is able to create mutliple house in one company.
noProblem The relationship between house hunter, realtor and companies have been well established.
noProblem The link submitted is not live. As a result, I could not test if the system is working as it is supposed to.

noProblem Yes they have been committing a bit regularly . Although the commits contribution are not equally distributed among the team members.
noProblem The team was regular in committing changes. The team continued to work in round 2 and made regular progress. All members contributed significantly. Great job! Could have started the project a bit earlier.
noProblem All commits happened during round 2, but work was done before.
noProblem Started committing after round 1
noProblem Yes, the team kept commiting the changes throughout the project and also in round 2.
noProblem Yes. Feedback has been accepted and changes made in round 2.
noProblem All the relationships have been properly defined in the models.
noProblem Yes they have properly defined the associations for every table and haven't missed on anything.
noProblem All dependencies are well modeled and designed. Every model has correctly associated relationships and validations. Your team is a pro! Realtor to house and house to company , other relationships are implemented. Each company has multiple realtors and each realtor can have multiple houses. Everything good here!
noProblem By looking at their model files, relationships are handled well.
noProblem DB mappings are done well. Cascading delete and cascading nullify implemented to handle delete cases.
noProblem Not many problem detected . working to the expectations.
noProblem All functionality seems to be present now.
noProblem Yes, the system works fine and authors have fixed the problems found in the first round. For an instance, Admin functionality and interest functionality were not present in round one but authors have implemented them now. 
noProblem All feedback has been accepted and changes made to fix them.
noProblem When the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses, all the houses and realtors are deleted as well. This is the expected functionality. Good job! All other test cases work as well. If an admin tries to delete a house hunter with multiple inquiries, all of his/her inquiries are deleted as well.
noProblem All deletion edge cases seem to be accounted for.
noProblem Yes, all the edge cases are handled very well.
noProblem Not able to log in as admin. Incorrect credential of admin.
noProblem The edge cases tested where handled properly with proper messages that shows which other entities will be affected by the change.
noProblem Models are not tested and controllers are partially tested.
noProblem No they haven't tested
noProblem Yes, the team has thoroughly tested and did validations.
noProblem Tests for controllers look good. Need to include more tests for models.
noProblem code naming convention done well.
noProblem The code has been implemented as per the Ruby standards of coding. However, there are few instances of code could be better handled such as the index function in admin controller.  
noProblem 1) Yes 2) No 3) No
noProblem commits performed during the course.
noProblem All the code of the project has been pushed to Github on a single day.
noProblem Only 8 commits were found. The first commit was dated around Oct 6. No changes were committed in round 2.
noProblem Didn't commit at regular intervals. Yes, committed changes in round 2.

noProblem The relationships are properly defined.
noProblem Follows the relationships properly.
noProblem the basic functionalities work successfully.
noProblem some edg cases are working.
noProblem Yes

noProblem The code is clean and readable and has been properly modularized.
noProblem The code is clean and easy to understand.  Code modularization principles are followed(didn't find any major code duplication issues).  
noProblem Yes code is clean and easy to read. Has followed coding standards, there are separate functional calls for each task.    
noProblem The team committed changes fairly frequently. There are no commits for the first phase of the project. However the project saw regular contributions after that (during the round 2). Overall good job! Could be more proactive during the first phase.
noProblem they only had 30 commits which I think is a little low considering there were two phases of submission. In my first phase, my team had at least 30 commits.
noProblem For the most part, it looks like this group only committed changes in round two. I know there was roughly one commit when I reviewed the first time, and the remainder of the changes were between Oct 6-10.
noProblem Yes, they did keep pushing updates after round 1.
noProblem Yes, the commit count has almost doubled from round 1 to round 2.
noProblem  Yes, the team had multiple changes committed through oct 6th through oct 10, in round 2

noProblem It looks like all the needed relationships were present in the schema.
noProblem Cardinal relationships have been defined in appropriate models 
noProblem 1-n and n-n relationships are all properly defined
noProblem All basic functionalities work as expected. You could have gone for the extra credit functionality such as the Google login or the email part. The email part was pretty easy :| . You've still done a great job with the overall design. The best I've seen thus far!  
noProblem Authors delivered nearly all the functionality I could think to test. It was a little weird being referred to a totally different page to have to upload images to houses, but not enough to deduct points.
noProblem Yes, major changes and feature implementations are there after 1st round. All basic functionalities are working properly.
noProblem (1): Admin can delete real-estate companies with realtors attached to it (2): Realtor is being able to delete any house (3): Admin can delete house-hunter with several enquires.
noProblem All test cases are covered. The README doesn't cover how edge cases are covered but that's not an issue.
noProblem 1. When the company of a realtor was changed, realtor details got updated with this new company details. But he could still edit/update the houses that he/she had listed for the prev company. They could send replies to inquiries also. 2. A realtor could edit the details of all the houses. 3. What will happen if the admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries? - cascade delete in working. 4. Other major edge cases are also working.
noProblem could see default testcases.
noProblem code naming convention done well.
noProblem 1) Yes 2) No 3) No
noProblem commits performed during the course.
noProblem handled 1 to n and n to n relationships succesfully.
noProblem The team has handled all the associations between multiple entities quite well.
noProblem The relationships are properly defined.
noProblem Follows the relationships properly.
noProblem the basic functionalities work successfully.
noProblem The code is well written following the right RoR coding practices
noProblem  
noProblem Follows good coding practice at most places.
noProblem Code is written in an efficient, clean and readable manner. All the functions are lucid and defined properly in blocks. A proper use of names for controllers, migrations and views can be seen.
noProblem yes the coding style was good
noProblem The committs have been done regularly throughout the development period, even during the round 2.
noProblem  
noProblem Code has been submitted frequently.
noProblem commit were done at a timely manner
noProblem The 1-n and n-n relationships are properly handled. 
noProblem Handles most of the relationships properly.   
noProblem  
noProblem All the relationships are correct. Also the houses table shows the time at which the house was created, which is impressive. Additionally, the real estate company also shows the number of realtors for each company, good work on that!
noProblem Yes, even constraints were defined well
noProblem Relationships are implemented correctly. 
noProblem There were issues with the admin functionalities in the first round. They have been fixed.
noProblem  
noProblem most issues were fixed
noProblem  
noProblem I think the code is well written. The function calls are very well done. It is neat and easily readable. Also, there is no bad naming the project. Code very well follows the DRY approach.
noProblem The code is clean and easily understood. A separate controller for adding the buyers to the potential buyer list is created. Overall the structure and naming of controllers and migration file is clear and the respective functionalities can be identified based on the names. The team has done good work on that
noProblem Function calls are added. Code is formatted and neat. Naming conventions are followed.
noProblem Several linear commits visible on the git. Most of the work done in round 2 is fixes and additional functionalities on top of the base that was finished before round 1.
noProblem The team promptly handled the task by working on it regularly and committing changes frequently.
noProblem I was unable to judge if this works -there was no way for me to determine that. The admin can not delete companies, can not view, edit or delete realtors or househunters. Also, users cannot delete themselves.  Further, the third party admin gem or module  used does not let me edit or delete users or companies either - it gives an error on heroku.  Thus, I was unable to determine if the edge cases work. Also README does not specify anything.
noProblem By looking at their github page, I could see they submitted their changes actively and also they continued submitting changes in round 2 as well.
noProblem The team submitted the changes at equal intervals of time and the last commit was performed a day prior to the deadline which is commendable.
noProblem This team continued to commit throughout the project.
noProblem The test for real_estate_companies_controller and real_estate_company model are present.
noProblem Team has been consistent in pushing code changes

noProblem  The team has done an impressive job in handling the tests for messages and real estate companies.
noProblem yes i can see a variety of edge cases being tested
noProblem The code looks comprehensive to a good extent with the usage of comments and clear naming. 1. Adding the remove from wish list feature is a plus point. 2. The naming is done well with attention to the singular and plural nouns for models and controllers. 3. No problem with respect to the coding clarity. 
noProblem The quality of the code is impeccable. Use of helper files and establishing a specific user through "def current_user" function in the application helper allowed the team to use a common user parameter throughout the application development and reduced the amount of effort that would have been needed other wise. 
noProblem  Code is very much readable. There are proper comments before the functions.
noProblem The code is well written. It is neat and easily readable. The function calls are very well done. Also, there is no bad naming the project. Code very well follows the DRY approach.
noProblem COde quality seems to be very good. Documentation aloong with instructions are present.
noProblem Mapping has been properly implemented.
noProblem The database design is close to perfect. The destroy and delete dependencies have also been well managed to allow deletion in cases where a house hunter gets deleted and all its inquiries are deleted automatically.
noProblem  Yes, the system does handle the relationships and the mappings are clearly defined.
noProblem I think the system handles the 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships well. The relationships are clearly defined with no problems. 
noProblem This system handle the 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships
noProblem The above case is covered.
noProblem The realtors controller has been very well tested by the team.
noProblem  The test cases are running fine. Clear steps for the same are given in the readme.
noProblem Excellent use of Rspec.
noProblem Yes, the team has tested thoroughly at least one model and one controller.
noProblem There isnt any commit after the first submission.
noProblem There are several linear commits to show progression of all the functionalities that were added to the project from the beginning. The team had more or less finished their work before round 1 and fixed a few bugs that were not easily discernible, in round 2.
noProblem  There are 136 commits I can see with clear commit messages.
noProblem By looking at their github page, I could see they submitted their changes actively and also they continued submitting changes in round 2 as well.th
noProblem 67 commits by one whereas 26 by the other two I was expecting an even number of commits
noProblem Very good commiting by entire team. Project was handled well and not messy.
noProblem The system has no perceivable issues.
noProblem  Functionalities are working fine. They are well documented in a separate pdf file as well. Even the read me contains clear instructions for setup.
noProblem Almost every feature is working as it's supposed to.
noProblem App as a whole works very well. The look and feel of it is also very good. Contributes to a very good overall user experience.
noProblem The system was able to pass all listed test cases. All the views have been perfectly setup as well and have disabled buttons where needed.
noProblem  There are enough edge cases tested and well documented in the attached pdf file. Could also view the some points to be taken care that are documented in specific cases.
noProblem 1) If the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses, it would not delete the record, because a dependent realtor exists. 2) The realtor can change his real estate company and he won't be prohibited from removing houses. 3) If admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries, the inquiries will be deleted and house hunter will be removed from the buyers' list.
noProblem Code written well with all DRY principles. Methods are simple and clean. Every method contains functions specific functionalities. Methods are simple and clean. Every method contains functions specific functionalities.
noProblem Looks decent.

noProblem Yes
noProblem The code is clean and readable. 
noProblem Code looks quite readable
noProblem looks alright.
noProblem The code is clean and well written. The controllers and models are named accurately and each filename describes the desired functionality. Good work on that!
noProblem The system properly handles the relationships where a real estate company can have multiple realtors. Also, it supports a realtor to create multiple houses and the house hunters to add multiple houses to their interest list.

noProblem The code is clearly written and easy to understand. The functionalities are separated and well defined. 
noProblem Commits aren't exactly spread evenly across the entire duration of the project. But, they have made changes in round 2. There have been significant improvements in the functionality and overall code in the project from my previous review.
noProblem With 108 commits, te team has continuously pushed changes to git to keep the version control in tact.

noProblem Good test cases written.
noProblem The edge cases tested where handled properly with proper messages that shows which other entities will be affected by the change.
noProblem Yes, the team has thoroughly tested and did validations.
noProblem Code written well with all DRY principles. Methods are simple and clean. Every method contains functions specific functionalities. Methods are simple and clean. Every method contains functions specific functionalities.
noProblem Code was committed throughout the project and during second round too.  
noProblem Yes: committed are constantly updated till today. README file was updated 3 hours ago. 
noProblem Although the relationships have been properly handled, I see in places with a belongs_to relationship optional:true option is present which allows violation of the relationship and is a bad idea.
noProblem The schema.rb file should be in the repo. From the models and the migrations, the relationships appeared to be correct.
noProblem DB relationships looked fine. New model was created for house style which could have been a parameter in house model itself.
noProblem can't login as admin in the REDAME flie.
noProblem User model could have been subdivided into different roles/models such as Realtor and Househunter. 
noProblem The admin credentials provided don't work and hence no admin functionality can be tested.
noProblem An exception occurred when replying to an inquiry. An inquiry could not be deleted by a house hunter.
noProblem Basic functionalities working fine.
noProblem The code has been written in a very clean and readable way. It is very legible and properly indented. I could not find and issues with the coding. There is no bad naming in this project and is neatly organised with instructions. One method handles only one specific task. There are function calls for multiple tasks. Yes, adding the user to the house's potential buyers is done by a separate method call. On the whole, the code quality is legit and I could not spot any long methods or too many nested blocks.
noProblem All functionalities works and can be successfully implemented. 
noProblem This project is very well organized, and the code style is great.
noProblem can not login as an admin
noProblem It's good to have the search logic in the model as opposed to the controller.
noProblem (1) What will happen if the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses? Can't be tested. (2) What will happen if a realtor changes his/her real estate company? Will (s)he be prohibited to remove the houses (s)he listed in the previous company? No realtor is still allowed to delete houses. (3) What will happen if admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries? Will the inquiries be automatically deleted? If this house hunter is a potential buyer of a house, will (s)he be removed from the corresponding potential buyers list? Cannot be tested (4)  Delete a house in a House Hunter's interest list and see if it still appears there? Works as expected
noProblem Yes. The team kept pushing commits through out the duration of the project. The team even kept pushing commits during round 2. Also all team mates seemed to have contributed equally.

noProblem works great. have mentioned in readme as well.
noProblem The above case is covered.
noProblem no test cases performed.
noProblem tested multiple controllers, but i don't see any models being tested.
noProblem Yes, the team has done pretty well in testing at least one model and one controller.

noProblem The system is well designed and all the features have been correctly added and all the functionalities work. The authors have fixed all the problems from the previous submission.
noProblem The system works as it is supposed to. For example the realtor, the admin and the user can login and perform the related functionalities successfully. 
noProblem The system was very strong through edge cases and the README.md was very detailed.
noProblem the first edge case wherein a comp[any is being deleted by the admin is handled perfectly and the associated listings and inquiries are deleted accordingly. The house hunter deletion is also handled perfectly so that their inquiry are deleted accordingly. Also the README.md  explains the working and the functionalities of each role properly.
noProblem (1) What will happen if the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses? It deletes it successfully.     (2) What will happen if a realtor changes his/her real estate company? Will (s)he be prohibited to remove the houses (s)he listed in the previous company? No, houses are easily changed and can be deleted by realtors.    (3) What will happen if admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries? Will the inquiries be automatically deleted? If this house hunter is a potential buyer of a house, will (s)he be removed from the corresponding potential buyers list?  It cannot be removed if inquiries are pending.    4) You can come up with more edge-cases. If the system fails in some edge-cases, explain with enough details Most of the functionalities I checked, such as creating a house, putting inquiries, removing various users, looking back in different accounts if it removes such as inquiries if user has still submitted or pending inquiries. All works fine. 
noProblem The tests looked good.
noProblem The team has tested the app using RSpec and thoroughly tests the user module
noProblem Good job on testing everything with rspec. Tests look concise and crisp.
noProblem The team has implemented rspec testing and have thoroughly tested one model namely the users model with this. Also the team has used minitest to thoroughly test the users controller.

noProblem First reviews comments were fixed.  
noProblem The readme document clearly mentions the edge cases when a company is deleted, what happens to the houses and realtors.
noProblem Edge cases are covered. When a company is deleted, the realtors and houses are also deleted along with it. The Readme.md file also details how the edge cases are handled.
noProblem Able to create two users with same email. And if I try to login with that particular email, error screen appears.

noProblem The code is clear and simple, most functions have seperate method calls.
noProblem The code followed the basic practices for clean and effective programming using Ruby and Rails. The methods and function calls were efficient in that they only performed the task it was assigned to do.
noProblem A major portion of the project was completed in the first stage itself. Certain noticeable changes that the team implemented in this stage included setting up admin functionalities to view and destroy the realtor or househunter accounts.
noProblem I think this team nailed the entity relationships with this application. Everything had the right relationships.

noProblem Yes, 22 commits in total and they have consistently kept on working on Git throughout.
noProblem 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships are handled correctly. The system utilizes foreign key columns in the database to achieve this. For example, 1-to-n relationship between realtor and real estate company is achieved by adding a company_id field to user table. Same utilized by houses table which are linked to one realtor and one company.
noProblem The system now works as expected. The common functionalities are working
noProblem Most of the functionalities are added and seem to be working. There are some breakages like realtor has a create inquiries option which should not be present, and it breaks on clicking it. Search functionalities based on footage, price location have not been added. Interest list for the user and potential buyers list for the realtor is not added.
noProblem Well written code, clean and easy to read.
noProblem Clean code and readable. 1. Yes 2. No 3. None
noProblem Very well written in the style of writing and the ruby MVC architecture is properly implemented.  1.

They have very smartly worked on it.  3. Coding style is absolutely conversant with the Ruby on Rails flavor of coding. 
noProblem The code is very well written.
noProblem Code is clean and well written. A task is handled by only one method. There are no bad naming in this project and is neatly organised with instructions. No issues with the code.  
noProblem  The code is written in a clean and readable way.
noProblem Yes, the team has been making commits through out the project tenure as well as round 2.
noProblem The commits are visible through out. Yes, commits have occurred in round 2.
noProblem They have worked on the project a lot, 120 commits, each one being descriptive. Good job there!
noProblem Yes they did. 118 commits
noProblem Yes, the changes were mostly evenly spread-out throughout the development cycle. This shows consistent efforts throughout.
noProblem Yes, they have a total of 117 commits which shows the consistency shown by them in working through the project and updating the changes. They have made a lot of vital changes in round 2. 
noProblem Yes, there are commits continuously made to the code as latest as 5 hours ago during review.
noProblem Yes the team kept on submitting their changes throughout their project. There are a total of 120 commits from the team and they still committed changes in round 2. They have committed the changes with proper messages also.
noProblem The relationships in the DB table have been carefully defined and they have taken care to relate 1 to n for houses, house hunters, inquiries, and so on. 
noProblem This application handles 1-n and n-n relationships properly. Company-realtor has 1-n relationship in the mapping table. I could not find any problem related to relationships. 
noProblem  By looking at their model file, they handled the relationship properly.
noProblem Perfectly functional and very well styled with the use of CSS and also the GUI is very user friendly. 
noProblem There seems to be a rudimentary test they have implemented as gathered by going through their file 'application_system_test'. This and the test file in the models shows that they have taken sufficient efforts to thoroughly examine their code. 
noProblem Of the functionality the team have tried to to implement, the code quality is not poor. However, the arrangement of code is difficult to understand given that not all functionalities seem to have been implemented. The "def after_sign_in_path_for" function in the applications controller used by the devise gem, only takes realtor as a resource, I would advise using an if or case condition within the function to allow other users to login. Also, I was unable to find any implementation for making sure that only the inquiries specific to a real estate company be visible to a realtor, and similarly only the inquiries posted by a house hunter themselves be visible to the house hunter on that specific house. I would again suggest using some If or case statements in the show function of the inquiries controller to establish identity of current_user. 
noProblem Yes, it is.
noProblem Changes to application continued throughout the second round of project submissions. Many of the commits deal with the adding additional functionality to the company controller, as well as, additions to the ReadMe. I can see that good work was made toward implementing missing functionality from the first round of submission.
noProblem Code seems to follow the Ruby Practices.
noProblem Code is written in a clean and readable way. There are separete methods for separate tasks.  Good naming convention is followed throughout the project.
noProblem recompany could have been just company
noProblem The team seems to have attempted to add to their functionality from the previous round. They have attempted to use the devise gem for allowing multiple user logins. It seems that they created a new git repo and started from the beginning which seems like a fair idea given that they wanted to use devise instead of implementing the user registration/sessions. 
noProblem Yes, they have keep commit to git as their project been working. 
noProblem Fewer commits on the project, More towards the deadline date.
noProblem Most of the commits are within the last 2 days before submission of project. Yes, commits for round 2 are provided properly.
noProblem The team submitted their changes towards the end of the project. They committed changes in round 2.
noProblem Checking the git log, the team still committed changes in round 2.
noProblem Though the commits started late in the project's life, there were commits frequently and also after round 1. The commit messages could have been a little more descriptive to fully comprehend the commit changes. 
noProblem Yes, there is a "has_many" relationship in company model, and also realtor is able to create mutliple house in one company.
noProblem From the Code DB Design looks fine. They have handled most of the relationships properly. Although I believe having different tables for admins/realtors/hunters/users/roles and role maps is un-necessary and just increases the complexity of the system. 
noProblem The relationship between house hunter, realtor and companies have been well established.
noProblem They committed quite many changes on the day of submission.
noProblem I cannot access the link provided by the team. Since this is hosted on AWS, I believe they have not opened the Ip to public by mistake (I have worked with AWS before and this happens). Maybe they worked from Library or their house, and when you spawn an instance in AWS it adds the IP from where the instance is spawned to the access list, which is why I am not able to access this from my IP. This can also be a problem with the proxy server setup in the instance and since you guys are maybe doing ssh into the server to deploy your code, the default HTTP request will go to port 80 and wont be forwarded to 8080 unless explicitly specified in apache/nginx and will block the requests. Easier way would be to host the app on heroku which handles all this automatically and provides you with a DNS entry
noProblem The link submitted is not live. As a result, I could not test if the system is working as it is supposed to.
noProblem The given link does not work and gives the following error: This site cant be reached 18.224.197.227 refused to connect. Hence, cannot comment on the functionalities.
noProblem The APP URL provided didn't work
noProblem Cannot Access App
noProblem Edge cases are not handled. But most of the logic will automatically handle edge cases.
noProblem The given link does not work and gives the following error: This site cant be reached 18.224.197.227 refused to connect. Hence, cannot comment on the edge cases.
noProblem The APP URL provided didn't work
noProblem There is no link to login as an admin. The site went down, so could not test further - This site cant be reached 18.224.197.227 refused to connect.   Search Google for 224 197 227 8080 house hunters sign   ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED    
noProblem No model tests have been implemented. Basic controller tests generated by scaffold and devise are available.
noProblem Yes, they have tested a lot. Like admin, house and inquiries.
noProblem Testing has been done for users controller and model.
noProblem Yes, the team has tested model and controller.
noProblem Some controllers are tested. Models are not tested thoroughly.
noProblem The test scripts have been written, however the scripts could have been written in a more elaborate way to include all the test cases and not just the high level tests. For example, the system accepts an Invalid phone number which is less than 10 digits of length. All these test cases could have been written and tested 
noProblem In general the code seemed to look fine. There were some really long methods like in the users_controller class, so I docked a star. There was a separate method for adding to interest list.
noProblem It looks like all the needed relationships were present in the schema.
noProblem Authors delivered nearly all the functionality I could think to test. It was a little weird being referred to a totally different page to have to upload images to houses, but not enough to deduct points.
noProblem The code follows all design style guidelines for Ruby. Good job! All methods are well designed and serve only one function. Naming and structure is uniform across the project.
noProblem All basic functionalities work as expected. You could have gone for the extra credit functionality such as the Google login or the email part. The email part was pretty easy :| . You've still done a great job with the overall design. The best I've seen thus far!  
noProblem 1.If admin deletes a company which has realtors and houses, the realtor associated with it get deleted. 2. Realtor can change her company and she can delete the ad posts previously posted by her. 3.Admin can delete the house hunter who has several queries and inquiries get deleted automatically.    
noProblem Yes, the commit count has almost doubled from round 1 to round 2.
noProblem 1-n and n-n relationships are all properly defined
noProblem Code written well with all DRY principles. Methods are simple and clean. Every method contains functions specific functionalities. Methods are simple and clean. Every method contains functions specific functionalities.
noProblem The code has been written in a very clean and readable way. It is very legible and properly indented. I could not find and issues with the coding. There is no bad naming in this project and is neatly organised with instructions. One method handles only one specific task. There are function calls for multiple tasks. Yes, adding the user to the house's potential buyers is done by a separate method call. On the whole, the code quality is legit and I could not spot any long methods or too many nested blocks.
noProblem This project is very well organized, and the code style is great.
noProblem It's good to have the search logic in the model as opposed to the controller.
noProblem Yes. The team kept pushing commits through out the duration of the project. The team even kept pushing commits during round 2. Also all team mates seemed to have contributed equally.
noProblem  Really good commit record with good comments as to what was changed.
noProblem Yes the number of commits have increased upto 110 commits.
noProblem Yes the team kept on submitting their changes throughout their project. There are a total of 110 commits from the team and they still committed changes in round 2.

noProblem This team kept committing through the end of the project.
noProblem They have actively committed code during the project duration including Round 2.
noProblem  Mapping checks out.
noProblem This application handles 1-n and n-n relationships properly. Company-realtor has 1-n relationship in the mapping table. I could not find any problem related to relationships. 
noProblem House hunter and Realtor can easily switch accounts.
noProblem All of the relationships are handled properly in the code.
noProblem The entity relationships have been established properly. They have also implemented cascading delete.
noProblem The search properties and addition of potential buyers needed to be improved and fixed after the first round. The authors fixed all of it for round 2. The system works exactly how it is supposed to work. I could not find any functionalities that are still failing. They have added additional features like signing up with google and sending replies to enquiries via email. 
noProblem All feedback has been fixed. No pending issues.
noProblem All of these are well handled and documented in the readme. Good work.
noProblem 1) If the admin deletes a company, all the related properties will be deleted and will remove the company name assigned to any realtor. 2) If the realtor changed his or her company, the realtor cannot make changes to old posts which they have posted for the previous company they worked for. So they will not be able to edit,add or remove the houses listed in previous company. 3) If the house hunter is deleted by the admin, all the inquiries by the house hunter will be deleted and their names in the potential buyers list is removed. The README.md covers how the system handles all these edge cases.
noProblem When a realtor changes real estate companies, they are able to edit houses listed from the new real estate company, but not from their old one. When a user with inquiries gets deleted, so do the inquiries.
noProblem The edge cases are covered. The readme file also details how these cases are handled. 
noProblem Test cases for the user have been implemented.
noProblem Still have lots of tests across all of the models and controllers but nothing super extensive that attempts to cover all possible cases.
noProblem The team has tested both a model and controller. The system can handle the following cases 1)when user uses same email to register twice.  2)should not save user with password less than 6 chars. 3)should not save user with invalid email 4)should not save user without email
noProblem The user model is tested, as are multiple controllers.

noProblem Yes the relationships are handled properly 1 company multiple realtors etc. No mapping table as such the schema handles it
noProblem I did not find any problems in the first phase testing. All basic functionalities work as expected. Bonus points for the UI. One of the best I have seen. The web application is intuitive and guides the user in performing any function. Great job!
noProblem First reviews comments were fixed.  
noProblem Yes, they used Rspect to test the code.
noProblem Most common cases are tested in controllers. They are using fixtures for testing 
noProblem Yes. the team has thoroughly tested.
noProblem Models and controllers are well tested. All edge cases are covered and tests are comprehensive. The inquiries controller is especially well tested. All assert statements are well thought of.
noProblem When the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses, all the houses and realtors are deleted as well. This is the expected functionality. Good job! All other test cases work as well. If a house hunter is deleted all of his/her inquiries are also deleted.
noProblem The readme document clearly mentions the edge cases when a company is deleted, what happens to the houses and realtors.
noProblem Edge cases are covered. When a company is deleted, the realtors and houses are also deleted along with it. The Readme.md file also details how the edge cases are handled.

noProblem The system was very strong through edge cases and the README.md was very detailed.
noProblem the first edge case wherein a comp[any is being deleted by the admin is handled perfectly and the associated listings and inquiries are deleted accordingly. The house hunter deletion is also handled perfectly so that their inquiry are deleted accordingly. Also the README.md  explains the working and the functionalities of each role properly.
noProblem The tests looked good.
noProblem The team has tested the app using RSpec and thoroughly tests the user module

noProblem yes about 83 commits.
noProblem The team improved upon certain aspects of their code. This included establishing the admin functions and actions as adding new companies and to view various participants involved.
noProblem I think the system handles the 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships well. The relationships are clearly defined with no problems.
noProblem The code procedure and application justified the 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships between the realtor and house hunter model as well as real estate company and realtor relationship mapped as 1-to-n.
noProblem I think the authors did a good job in developing the system. The system is working as it is supposed to work.
noProblem Yes, I feel the team has done pretty well in testing at least one model and one controller.

But 'before after ' way worked too !
noProblem Yes, I followed the youtube link to check the tests and they have tested the controllers. 
noProblem Testplen looks exhaustive and is explained well.

noProblem Unfortunately, the write-up does not include a test plan. The team has included the following line in the "Testing" section: "Fixed the existing test cases for the review feedback by a team instead of a team member." The team could improve this by adding the test cases to maybe to check whether the "get_feedback_assessment" method returns the proper assessment using teamid or not or check whether the summary reports navigation redirects the user to the correct page or not.

noProblem The variables, methods and class names are aptly named. I could not find names which are not suggestive of functionality.
noProblem Great work. Clearly Understandable. Functions are of appropriate length, Codes are in appropriate methods, Code is very well commented, Code follows ruby style guide. Good naming.  
noProblem Good work on including test cases. The app works fine after testing.
noProblem Could not detect any flaws. Works exactly as it has been been in the wiki. Good guidance. 
noProblem Testplen looks exhaustive and is explained well.
noProblem All the test plan is converted to automated testing.
noProblem They have included a test model video in which all the test are passing. It looks complete
noProblem Yes, it looks they have converted all the cases into the Test Plan.
noProblem The variable and method names are apt.
noProblem The code follows the DRY principle.
noProblem They do work as intended.
noProblem All the cases are covered.
noProblem Testing isn't applicable to this assignment. 
noProblem The authors have not converted test cases into automated tests. However manual testing has been shown in the vedio link attached
noProblem All provided variables are well assigned.
noProblem Good thing would be to increase the test coverage.
noProblem Variables and methods seemed intuitive enough
noProblem The functions added are not too long. This is the minimal amount of code that had to be added to implement the changes.
noProblem The commits show contribution by only 1 author. The code does not smell DRY.
noProblem As mentioned above, and also stated in the video and the pull request itself, the author has covered up everything.
noProblem  
noProblem hey variables follow all the stanard conventions that it needs to.
noProblem Not possible to test work manually.
noProblem I cannot find the code
noProblem The test cases given by the team work as described. The features are implemented accordingly. The edge cases are considered while designing the mocks. In general, all the code for test cases works as specified.
noProblem The code is DRY however, certain sections of the code could be shortened further.
noProblem Video seems fine, covers all the cases with 100% coverage.
noProblem More comments are needed.
noProblem  It has all the details about the testing for review_response_map class.
noProblem The unit test cases were completely fine, and covered almost all of the code.
noProblem  It divides testing codes into parts, and described purpose of each chunk of code.
noProblem everything seems to be working fine.
noProblem Briefly covered all the possibilities.
noProblem Since the code is not deployed, manually testing cannot be performed. But, the screencast shows that all the manual testing is passed.
noProblem From the video it seems it should work fine with the edge cases as well.
noProblem Manual testing could not be performed as the link to the deployed application was not available however the vedio link attached sufficiently demonstrates how the features work.
noProblem all the scenarios including the corner cases are working fine. No issues or problems were found with the functionality. The only issue is related to the CI built which is failing at the moment. The team needs to analyse the root cause related to the build failure and fix it. Other than that it was a great team effort!  
noProblem The write up seems quite understandable. 
noProblem The write up is well written and explain how and what is done in the project regarding all the issues.  Just one suggestion- it would have been great if the screenshots were uploaded corresponding to the changes made. But, otherwise the writeup is understandable. 
noProblem Yes, the project is to do 2 things : 1. Stop teams from dropping assignments very late / close to deadline 2. Have different deadlines when assignments are done at different periods. The wiki should be created on expertiza page and not on wikipedia site.
noProblem The write-up is clear and clearly explains the issues corrected.
noProblem The wiki is well written and contains all required information regarding the project. The screenshots can be included in the wiki and the code pasted in the documentation could be formatted. The team also need to inlcude the test plan section in the wiki. Apart from this , the team did a great work.   
noProblem Good, but lacks readability. The code is directly copy-pasted in the approach section. You could have used the pseudo code with proper explanations. The structure and formatting should be improved.
noProblem No test plan is included but it seems that team have covered all the scenarios properly.
noProblem The write up does not have a test plan.
noProblem I found the test cases to be sufficient. No suggestion needed.
noProblem I don't think there's any testing involved in this assignment.
noProblem Writeup doesn't has a test plan but in the video they have tested a lot. Also please add audio as well in your video explaining what you are doing and why so that its easy for the user to understand, otherwise watching 23 minutes silent videos is just to much.
noProblem No proper test plan has been mentioned yet in the write-up. But a link to demo vedio is available which includes the manual testing case.
noProblem Test plan section is missing.
noProblem Writeup clearly explains why the team followed the particular approach and additionally mentions all the steps followed,thus defining the approach clearly.
noProblem The writeup does talk about the changes and why the authors did it that way.   Rather than pasting the code (without any indentation) in the wiki page, the authors could have pasted screenshots of the code! This might have made it easier to comprehend.    
noProblem The readme was sufficient to explain details about the idea and also both the videos explain stepwise how this is achieved and demonstrates it. Also the bugs are fixed and droptopicdeadline has been integrated into the code of this assignment.
noProblem It's hard to understand the code you have changed from writeup. I saw the changes in your pull request it looks good to me.
noProblem Not very comprehensive.
noProblem Yes the tests are automated, also the command to run the test is given in the wiki.
noProblem the code follows Ruby style guide. the code does not contain long methods. the variables and functions are properly named.

noProblem The code looks good.
noProblem The code works fine for the listed functionalities. All the cases along with the edge cases are considered.  
noProblem the basic test cases are test well.
noProblem The code works in the edge cases also for delete an other tests mentioned.
noProblem  The test cases work as expected and handles edge cases as well
noProblem Yes, the code has all the possible test cases. Many of the edge cases are covered and listed in the wiki.
noProblem There are no changes to any files in the spec directory so there are no new tests.
noProblem No tests were added.
noProblem New method names and variables are fine, however this team did not add a lot of new classes, methods, etc.
noProblem 2 failed and 1 accepted. 
noProblem Their code changes are little, though they have handled naming conventions in a good way, as illustrated below. def self.handle_duplicate  
noProblem The work done is successfully implementing the required changes
noProblem all the code looks well written and dry to me.
noProblem The handle_duplicates function has a lot of white space and print statements left in it. It could've been chopped up into tiny sub-functions too, hypothetically.
noProblem 1. Functions are of appropriate length and well structured with respect to the purpose in question.  2. All code has been suitably well put into the methods with their intended function and work cutout for them.  3. No, the comments have been well placed and self explanatory making it easy to follow.  4. The code does follow the ruby style guidelines and is thorough in that regard.  5. Nope, all code is consistent and to the point. 
noProblem The code contribution is significant. The function such as import_team_members shows good coding practice and following Ruby code standards. 
noProblem Their code changes as per the pull request is less.  They have done justice to the little code they changed.
noProblem The code is well written following the concepts
noProblem Worked as documented
noProblem Minimal changes were made to the test suite and new tests were not written for the new code.
noProblem No test plan. Don't know why this question is even asked.
noProblem Methods, names etc are used according to the functionality. As mentioned earlier half the code changes are explained.
noProblem Code is good enough.
noProblem The variables, methods and class names are aptly named. I could not find names which are not suggestive of functionality.
noProblem The names seem to be appropriate to their functionality.
noProblem Well written
noProblem 1. Functions are of appropriate length 2. Codes are in appropriate methods 3. Code is very well commented. Overall, great work. Clearly Understandable.
noProblem Basic functionalities working

noProblem The writeup is good and it clearly meantions the issues to be fixed in the problem statement and the code modified is also displayed.
noProblem Write up is easy to understand and follow.
noProblem No test plan required I suppose.
noProblem Yes the writeup mentions why the authors did the work the way they did it by clearly posting screenshots of the code modifications done by them.
noProblem Yes, the team has efficiently detailed all the details about the projects and the need for their changes to providing code of their changes. They have also attached coverage and test run screen shots for references.
noProblem They team has thought through efficiently to use design options that avoid test reruns and to dry out some mocks settings
noProblem Yes they have come up with all possible inputs, edge cases and wrong data entries to check the system behaviour is not faulty
noProblem Yes there is no unreasonable function names and all method name are suggestive and apt
noProblem yes they have automated test and all of them pass
noProblem The wiki clearly defines the primary objective of the project and justifies the reasoning behind introduction of additional helper constructs like participant factory. The authors complement the descriptions of each test case with associated block of code and elaborate on the details of their inner workings. I would suggest removing parts like high level descriptions of Expertiza and Unit Tests (http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/index.php/OSS_E1852.rb#Unit_Test_Description) because they are redundant in this context.
noProblem The test plan is comprehensive and fully covers all the methods and cases that are part of the object under test. Running the test suite yields 100% overall coverage.
noProblem Every test case that is provided on the wiki page is part of the automated test suite. There are no cases of failing tests.
noProblem Running the code manually resulted in the 100% coverage of the object under test.
noProblem Yes, it is easy understand that it is a testing project and how it is done.
noProblem It explains clearly what tests are missing and how the coverage is increased.
noProblem The plan looks good and it covers a lot of cases.
noProblem All the code is in a single file as it tests a single model and it seems to cover it extensively. It also looks like there's no DRY issues.
noProblem Yes and it all passes too.
noProblem Yes they have explained everything.
noProblem It looks great. Everything is followed.
noProblem Code seems to be concise and well written.
noProblem Since coverage is 100% and the code looks good to me, I am assuming it works fine.
noProblem The writeup is clear and easy to understand.
noProblem Yes.
noProblem The test plan look complete enough.
noProblem They kept working on it and did really impressive.
noProblem YES.
noProblem The features work as intended
noProblem The wiki page provides clear details about the work, and very easy to understand.
noProblem It is a testing task, I assume there is not any design needed.
noProblem looks like edge cases and invalid inputs are handled.
noProblem  
noProblem  
noProblem  
noProblem  
noProblem For every tested method, they explain what they did and why they did it.
noProblem Names for variables, classes, and method are properly named and make sense.
noProblem This was a testing project and the mocked objects were appropriate. The code is DRY. There is no redundancy in the code.
noProblem All the cases discussed in the test plan have been implemented. Well done in achieving 100% test coverage and passing all the tests.
noProblem The features work as intended, they cover the test cases and edge cases as well.
noProblem  They even wrote down their plan to accomplish the project! I love it.
noProblem Magic. How did they know they needed a Test Plan?!? They did a great job laying out how they created an environment to unit test Participant with their design choice, and chosen variables and factories.
noProblem So fresh and so clean, clean! This code is too neat to even be dry. Too hot to touch. I'm just still super impressed by the wiki and the video.
noProblem over 9000! I mean 90%! Great job testing Participant y'all!
noProblem After working through several edge case side effects, by hand, up hill, both ways, it looks like all of their bases are covered and edge cases satisfied.
noProblem Not many functions defined. Only database changes made and inbuilt function used.
noProblem Pull request build passes well and there are no issues.
noProblem The naming conventions are followed as per standards
noProblem I think the code looks good and very much follows the Ruby Style Guide. The code also is DRY. It looks well written and does not any changes.
noProblem Follows ruby standard codes. Already implemented functions are changed and have stayed away from adding too many functionalities. 
noProblem Everything works fine according to me.
noProblem Very precise write-up with nice details on how the fixes were applied.
noProblem The written explanation is good. Add few screenshots of the change to be able to understand the changes done visually.
noProblem The write up is detailed. All details are mentioned including files involved, solution as well as test plan and how they have done or implemented the solution. The code snippets also gives good idea of the project work. The first part gives detailed background of the project. 
noProblem Enough details has been provided.
noProblem Yes it explains with clarity the issue at hand, UTF-8 only support & how that causes trouble. Also improper formatting of HTML tags.
noProblem I think the test-plan is complete and most of the edge cases are covered.
noProblem Testing was not part of the requirements. Team did manual testing.
noProblem They have included test plan but few examples and screenshot of their work would have been a plus point.
noProblem I understood the write-up pretty well. I also liked to way the fix was implemented
noProblem Yes, the writeup explains explains how the authors did their work and they have mentioned the steps behind each functionality. They have not used any design principles or patterns. 
noProblem Yes, team has explained why they worked in certain way.
noProblem It explains their approach and issues they encountered like latin format, storing html tags and how they fixed it.
noProblem There is no Test Plan section at this time. However, the authors did include some discussion of edge cases and the fact that the initialize function required testing of known success case and potential failure. I think that this is sufficient without the inclusion of a Test Plan section. I would suggest that since this rubric calls for the section to just rearrange the content of your current page. Also, include the additional edge cases that you have already tested for in the other functions possibly with some specific examples. This will allow for a more thorough Test Plan section.
noProblem Variable names and test cases are name appropriately. Test cases context, describe, and it statements are clear as to the division and purpose.
noProblem The code is written very neat and follows suggest guidelines. Authors have done a great job with the DRY principle and bringing out statements that would have been otherwise repetitive in the test cases.
noProblem The authors seem to have considered most edge cases and pre-conditions. The section isn't explicitly named 'Test Plan', but the necessary content is there.
noProblem Everything is described clearly and the functionality added is easy to understand.
noProblem All code is formatted well and neatly, with clear functionality.
noProblem All tests designed were to be automated.
noProblem Nothing to manually test. 
noProblem The write-up is descriptive and shows code from the _spec file paired with explanation.
noProblem The pseudo-code test plan does a good job of explaining the functionality of the tests without being clogged up by implementation details. I do suggest putting it closer to the top of the wiki page though.
noProblem All tests pass, and 100% coverage was attained.
noProblem Very nicely written document with test-plan which explains each test case , why it is written and what it tests n simple English language.
noProblem very nicely articulated description of all 29  testcases.
noProblem Rspec code looks good.Proper comments and good variable name usage are 2 things i will suggest to improve. Very good work overall.
noProblem Yes , all 29 test cases have been automated. The youtube video describes it perfectly
noProblem The tests run successfully even when cloned and run in development environment on VCL.
noProblem Tried to cover maximum test cases and explained well in the document with the coverage and video
noProblem The write-up explains the tasks adequately enough for a user to understand the expected outcome.

noProblem The write up is very clear, methods and test case are explained in a neat way
noProblem  The procedure and intention for writing the test cases is clearly mentioned
noProblem  All the scenarios are covered. Even the branch cases
noProblem All of the above 5 criteria are met.
noProblem Yes most of the edge cases is checked.
noProblem The writeup has documented all the changes they have done, but could have been more elaborative on the exact functionality of menu.rb. 
noProblem No, all method names and describe provided are apt and to the point
noProblem yes and all cases pass
noProblem Their tests are very straight-forward and can be extended to test few edge cases
noProblem Authors explain the test destination vividly.
noProblem Yes.
noProblem All variable names are reasonable and easy to understand.
noProblem Neat code and well established form of the test.
noProblem Yes.
noProblem Test plan looks very generic.
noProblem Test plan is given a appreciable thought and team has also implemented test scenarios mainly in student_task_controller_spec.rb Would suggest team to try and increase test coverage.
noProblem Good work on including test cases.
noProblem The code changes are well organized and nothing is out of place.
noProblem I could see commit performed by only single team member. 1. Functions are not too long or repeatative. 2. No code needs to be extracted as a new function. 3. Yes team need to add more comments. 4. Team does follow Ruby style guide. 5. Team understood rails and followed DRY principle well.  
noProblem I feel some comments can be added before every function for the code to be understood better.
noProblem 1. Functions are of appropriate length 2. Codes are in approriate methods 3. Code is very well commented. Overall, great work.
noProblem the features added seem to be running good .
noProblem The code works as it should.
noProblem The wiki documentation has been updated. All the information has been documented in a neat and logical manner. The write up adequately provides what functionality the work is related to.

noProblem Wiki has been well written, with enough clarity and description
noProblem It is clear what the project does and why it does it.
noProblem The writeup is clear. It is easy to understand what the project does. It would be better if you can put in more code details and major pieces that do the important logic.
noProblem The writeup is pretty clear.
noProblem The test plan section is present, and it is covering all the scenarios.
noProblem They seem to have included a testing plan have mentioned it in their report. They seem to have considered edge cases and other possibilities.

noProblem The team has made minimal changes in the code to fix the issues. No new class, function or variable has been added.
noProblem All tests pass.
noProblem Yes.
noProblem No automated tests. But the fix seems to be working fine as per the test plan provided.
noProblem No issues found.
noProblem The newly added code adheres to ruby programming standards.
noProblem The names used seem appropriate to their intended functionality.
noProblem The variables, methods and class names are named appropriately. The variables used in the program suggest the functionality.
noProblem There are no additions in terms of methods or any new implementation. There are minuscule changes done so it still follows the existing standard. 
noProblem There were not many big changes. All the changes are crisp and to the point.
noProblem The team has done well not to over complicate the issues and have resolved them with relatively few additions.
noProblem The code follows Ruby style Guidelines and is DRY.
noProblem The code resolves all the issues as per the problem statement and the features work correctly.
noProblem It works as expected.
noProblem Seems to be working.

noProblem Write up is clearly understandable. Systematic approach taken to fix the issue.
noProblem Write up is quite impressive. I was able to understand the project through write up.
noProblem The write-up is good and clearly mentions the issues to be corrected.
noProblem The problem is explained clearly and the implementation plan is also described elaborately. The explanation helps in understanding the project very well.  
noProblem The team has included test plan as well as the screenshot of the manual testing.
noProblem Write up has test plan with clear steps and screenshots.
noProblem They have covered few edge cases. Just a suggestion to include result before and after fixing the issue. May be juxtapose it.
noProblem Yes, the project deals with an issue related to names, such as not allowing whitespaces , etc. The test verify that the issues are now solved.
noProblem The test plan looks good. It includes both manual testing and automated testing by writing Rspec tests.
noProblem Yes the team has done great job in the write up It is properly indexed and addresses details about each issue and its solution.
noProblem Write up explains about the problem and how it needs to be fixed which seemed logical
noProblem They standardized the team name generation and fixed the username without space. For design patterns I think they didn't used it may be it wasn't needed
noProblem No write-up available rn
noProblem The write-up clearly mentions the issues to be fixed and the code changed to fix each issue.
noProblem The write-up explains the approach used and the code used for implementation very clearly. The test plan is also defined extensively. Screenshots help in understanding the implementation more. They did not use any design patterns. 
noProblem All test cases seem to be passed.
noProblem Ruby coding practice seem to be fine. Class and variable names are apt.
noProblem method names and variables are used aptly which helps in easy understanding
noProblem The newly added variable, methods, class names are written properly. The names indicates the functionality implemented by respective names.   
noProblem Function and variable names seemed to be appropriate enough. The names suggested the functionality. No suggestion is needed.
noProblem All the names are intuitive and reasonable. Good job following naming conventions!
noProblem The naming conventions are properly followed. In case of Ruby, snake case has been properly used and in case of JavaScript code, camel case is used. 
noProblem 3
noProblem Methods are not too long and each function is performed in the appropriate method

No need to extract code further into more functions. 3. Code was understandable and easy to understand. 4. Code does follow ruby style guidelines. 5. Code and packages follow DRY principle. 
noProblem Code seemed to follow the ruby style guide
noProblem none of the functions are too long   could find changes where DRY principle was violated   the code follows ruby convention and guidelines   comments were included wherever necessary. the code is easy to follow.   Good Job!
noProblem The code is well written. The function length is also well within the required bounds. Comments adequately convey the info about the functionality that is implemented. 
noProblem They have not provided a link for the deployed so cannot test anything but they have provided a video and according to that everything seems to be working
noProblem Not deployed but the video provided which includes the demonstration of the fix.
noProblem The manual testing done in the screencast seems fine. The features work correctly
noProblem Everything is explained in detail
noProblem Issues explained properly and change as well. The modifications are demonstrated using screenshots which helps in better understanding.
noProblem The test plan seems to be complete enough. No additional pre-conditions and edge cases are required.
noProblem Issue 1 under solutions tab is actually the third point discussed in the Fixes Required.It could be discussed as Issue 3 rather Issue 1 for better clarity. Only the solution for one issue is discussed. (?) The discussed solution is again well-defined with adequate screenshots.
noProblem One test case visible. 
noProblem yes the functionality still holds good.
noProblem Decreased to 12%. 
noProblem The test coverage on the contrary decreased
noProblem The names are intuitive.
noProblem The variable names look fine, methods names are also meaningful.
noProblem 1. Some Functions are of huge length and adequately structured with respect to the purpose in question, but I am assuming the complexity of the question requires so.  2. All code has been suitably well put into the methods with their intended function and work cutout for them.  3. No, the comments have been well placed and but are very strange and vague at some places suggesting an amateur approach.  4. The code does follow the ruby style guidelines and is thorough in that regard.  5. Nope, all code is somewhat consistent and vaguely to the point. 
noProblem Not really clear. Lines have been changed. No specific functions. But it shows good coding skills.
noProblem The project's purpose is to refactor the code. Hence the code has been separated into different files for better understanding.
noProblem I can see a file changed and the code in it looks to follow the concepts which needs to be followed
noProblem The code follows Ruby standards and DRY principle.
noProblem The code seemed ok to me.
noProblem The functionality does work. Some errors are visible as shown by Git. 
noProblem Cant really know what exactly is completed.
noProblem  Some of the common edge cases work as per expected
noProblem They were not required to write automated tests as far as I know
noProblem The newly added code does adhere common HTML standards. The only other change is to the db schema.
noProblem Variable, methods and class names seems as per coding standards and variable  names are making it easy to understand the logic code. Hence names used are reasonable. 
noProblem The only change this team had to do was add color codes for the various types of links that come up while reviewing. This would be hard to mess up.  And the team has not messed it up. Good Job guys.
noProblem The added code is easy to understand and not complex.
noProblem The code added is extremely easy to read, follow and understand.
noProblem repeated style tags
noProblem Looks good.
noProblem The code follows Ruby guidelines. However, since the project involved just adding colour to certain links there was no point of the code being DRY. In fact, reviewing this project doesn't make sense since the project was literally just changing 3 lines of code, NOT THAT IT IS THE FAULT OF THE TEAM.
noProblem  The code is complete and does what it was intended to do.
noProblem The implemented solutions work in the deployment
noProblem There are just the changes in the button colours required which are working as expected.
noProblem Yes. Team has resolve the issue very well and also taken care of edge cases.
noProblem The changes in this project were simple enough to work for all edge cases.
noProblem Looks great.
noProblem Yes. The team clearly indicates in the wiki, what this project is related to and how they went about to complete the given task at hand. I'm not sure about this, but maybe the heading for the wiki is incorrect. This project is listed as E1828 in the list of OSS projects. But the team have named it as E1785. This may be a mistake on the team's part, if so, I would suggest them to correct it.
noProblem The document is well described with details on Expertiza, its purpose. It also details the files related to their assignment.
noProblem Explained very well.
noProblem There is no scope of a test plan with changes made to the view.
noProblem There is no explicit test plan mentioned in the wiki. But for this project I don't believe one was needed.
noProblem The writeup doesn't has a test plan, but the work they have done is on UI i.e. colouring the links. So there won't be any edge cases as such to fail in this project.
noProblem They have explained the changes they have done and why they have done them. 
noProblem The project was to change the colour of certain links to depict certain statuses. Since the complexity of the project was not high there was no scope to use any design principles or patterns.
noProblem  The write up explains each and every thing which they implemented
noProblem The code change seems simple enough that does not require any design principle or patterns. Whatever the code changes are, explained properly and coding principles with required output.
noProblem The write up does intend to capture the changes that have been made, there isn't much for them to explain and thus the writeup seems short. There isn't much scope for the team to have used design patterns in a project which involved making cosmetic changes to the views.
noProblem The authors have implemented every test case that is discussed in the test plan. Detailed explanations and code itself is provided in the project's wiki page.
noProblem The write is very descriptive and included code from both the model and the spec file.
noProblem The writeup explains how the tests relate to their respective methods.
noProblem The added tests look very clean.
noProblem Everything in the wiki was a test.
noProblem  Looks good. Explains what work is done and what is the corresponding output
noProblem Coverage has increased by 7 percent overall
noProblem Does not apply as its a testing project with most testcases written in a single Rspec file to test the functionality
noProblem Yes all 17 test cases are automated
noProblem Tests work
noProblem very clearly writeup.
noProblem Functionalities have been tested properly.
noProblem Naming conventions are followed. Test coverage has increased.
noProblem FuncyFunctionalare of correct length.
noProblem Test cases are present. 
noProblem Video covers how to run the test cases which are clear and understandable.
noProblem  All variables, methods and class names look reasonable.
noProblem the document contains the whole information including the test plans and the the expertiza environment setup. It is neatly documented as well which makes it more readable
noProblem Yes the have mentioned all of the required work and its related explanation. they have reasoned out their exact methods and the issues to be considered while testing in the problem statement. 
noProblem Yes the test appears complete as they have mentioned all from setting up the expertiza environment to the tests that they have implemented along with the plan of the they executed their project
noProblem it follows the standard ruby practices . All the variables , methods and class name look reasonable. The added tests looks very clean
noProblem Yes all  the 17 test cases are automated. They have reached the goal of 90% coverage . 
noProblem It is well written, quite understandable. It clearly and adequately indicates the working functionality. I can understand what the project is about.
noProblem Yes, the writeup explains explains how the authors did their work and they have mentioned the steps behind each functionality. They have put a video explanation of the same.
noProblem Yes, the Test Plan looks complete and includes all the test cases and the actions.
noProblem Pull request build passes well and there are no issues.
noProblem Well, the code looks good and very much follows the Ruby Style Guide. The code also is DRY. It looks well written and does not any changes.
noProblem Yes, the admin has included the Test Plan cases in the automated tests.

noProblem Good work on including test cases.
noProblem The variables, methods, and class names do seem to follow proper convention and are suggestive of the functionality they are being used for. In some cases they could have used a liitle more desciptive names for variables for example inside app/helpers/student_task_helper.rb  they could have used background_colour instead of rtn as a variable name in the due_date_color() method. It will become more readable for the reviewers to understand the functionalities.
noProblem The variables, methods and classnames are aptly named. I could not find names which are not suggestive of functionaliy.
noProblem The code changes are well organized and nothing is out of place.
noProblem In due_date_color switch case would have been a better approach then if else if block. Lots of code that is done in view can be moved to the controller. Follow MVC architecture. 
noProblem  The functions seem to be implemented in a good manner and the code seems to be DRY.. In some cases though the authors could have improved as in the i app/helpers/student_task_helper.rb  file. In side the due_date_color method they could have used case expressions in Ruby instead of the if else logic implemented as that would be a more Ruby on Rails way of doing it. As it will reduce the lines of code as well as being a more elegant way of handling it.

noProblem The team has explained the issue and the solution they chose with enough details to understand to way of implementation.
noProblem They explained it well, but there were no larger design patterns they seemed to be following. I did think that they used AJAX in the appropriate way, but it could be improved in the future.
noProblem Their solutions are well explained. The way they have explained, attaching a screenshot of a code snippet and telling, this is where we made this change, and this is how it works, gives a better understanding of their project. It could have been better if they could have compare and contrasted the previous codes, where the features where not there. That way, the background of the why this feature could have been clear.

noProblem The writeup explains well the plan of work of the authors and the way in which they approached the task at hand.
noProblem Appropriate explanations are provided for the tests.
noProblem There were no testcases and since they provided a screenshot of the desired work. I suppose it fulfills the requirement
noProblem Few new names were added, and they look fine.
noProblem Yes, on manual testing, it leads to realization that the code has been suitably written as required by the functionalities and also the doc they have provided is the results that I get on following the procedure. Although, I would suggest that they look more into the test case 3 because how to go about testing it hasn't been explained by them. 
noProblem The functionality works as explained in the design document. 
noProblem The menu which they emphasized on, seems complete and running
noProblem The writeup is extremely clear. I understand each issue they address.

noProblem They have neatly organised the solution by the each problem, the solution they provided and the screenshots of output which is useful in testing. They have highlighted the changes and explained where exactly the change has been proposed(down to the granularity level of each function call and each line) which gives a clear idea of the code. I can clearly see what the problem is and functionality the work is related to.
noProblem Great writup which contains all cases the task required, and it's easy to understand since there are lots of screenshots to explain their task clearly.

noProblem The team have done a good job in explaining their work.
noProblem the related functionality is mentioned.
noProblem The wiki as well as a design document has been created for the write up which explains the refactoring requirements. The team has explained the technical aspects in a very detailed manner. However, it would be helpful for users if the team could add more details about the functional aspects so that a end user can test the impact on the existing functionality due to the changes done.
noProblem Perfectly explained write up along with the design document to get the better understanding of the issues and flow.
noProblem Write is clear and well written, a trivial formatting mistake ( new implementation bullets ) but that is fine.  Problem statement is well define and the existing solution too. Problem statement does not need to state that RSpec tests have been added.    
noProblem The team has leveraged the existing test cases to align with the changes implemented. It would have been more helpful to include the test cases in the write up as well.
noProblem Existing tests have been modified to changed to pass for the new implementation.  News tests could have been added 
noProblem writeup explains in  brief how and why the functionality of sidekiq was implemented.
noProblem The wiki has been documented with a lot of details explaining the problem statement as well as the approach.
noProblem Yes the authors explain the existing solution and explain the drawbacks for in them.  I would have liked to see a point wise comparison on how their solution overcomes the existing drawbacks.  I would suggest not to hard code the mail text/subject in the code and use a config file instead. This will be easy to modify in future. I would have liked if the authors added why they took sidekiq and not rabbitmq or celery  
noProblem Good work on including test cases.
noProblem The variables, methods and classnames are aptly named. I could not find names which are not suggestive of functionaliy.
noProblem The code changes are well organized and nothing is out of place.
noProblem 1. Functions are of appropriate length 2. Codes are in approriate methods 3. Code is very well commented. Overall, great work.
noProblem the features added seem to be running good .
noProblem The code works as it should.
noProblem The wiki documentation has been updated. All the information has been documented in a neat and logical manner. The write up adequately provides what functionality the work is related to. The project changes to the code have been described in paragraphs which could have been better if they could have updated with code snippets and screen shots of the tasks at hand.
noProblem Wiki has been well written, with enough clarity and description
noProblem It is clear what the project does and why it does it.
noProblem The writeup is pretty clear.
noProblem The test plan section is present, and it is covering all the scenarios.
noProblem They seem to have included a testing plan have mentioned it in their report. They seem to have considered edge cases and other possibilities.
noProblem Wiki has been well written, with enough clarity and description
noProblem They have explained how they have implemented each task by adding/editing files.
noProblem Yes, the writeup explains what the authors did.
noProblem Mostly looks good. Can change names like this is_selfreview_enabled to is_self_review_enabled and assignment_form_assignment_num_metareviews_allowed to assignment_form_assignment_num_meta_reviews_allowed. selfreview shouldn't be a single string.
noProblem The code seems to have been well written with the reasonable variable names.
noProblem  Their code is clear and reasonable.
noProblem The code changes are majorly html changes and not Ruby changes
noProblem The names suggest the functions properly.
noProblem  Maybe some more comments will be helpful.
noProblem Its nicely written and follows dry principle. They have used existing functions where required.
noProblem The code changes are majorly html changes and not Ruby changes The DRY principle explained in the document is clear and talks about DRY being handled
noProblem The code is well written and follows DRY principle.
noProblem The features seem to work well
noProblem They haven't deployed it but have shown in the video and documentation the edge cases, so i think it might just work.
noProblem The features are working good as shown in the screencast
noProblem The codes work well as the team described in wiki.
noProblem The project has been explained in great detail. Just feel instead of using issue numbers, if the team had explained the issue in brief before elaborating on it, that would have been great.
noProblem The review is clear and explanatory. They have discussed all the essential topics needed - Test plans, MVC, DRY principles. 
noProblem They have explained every aspect of the project really well. Plus the video also show the changes they have done. One thing you can add is audio in your screencast videos, telling what is being done so that its easy for the user to understand.
noProblem  They explained the problem very well.
noProblem The test plan seems to be good as they've included test plan for every issue.
noProblem Good detail covering how you test different issues in the code.
noProblem The test plan has covered various cases and completely explainable in simple terms Small suggestion, The first paragraph could have been itemized for easier understanding.
noProblem Yes they have explained everything in detail.
noProblem  They showed their work with screenshots which contain some edge cases.
noProblem The team has a good understanding of the code and issues, they found there are two issues fill in the same category and gives good explanation of what jobs the code they have added do.
noProblem Yes, The authors have done a great job in explaining their work with code snippets.
noProblem Good job explaining your work and talking about staying dry.
noProblem They have discussed everything. The way they have split the features and explained it one by one with the code is good.
noProblem They have explained everything nicely. I don't think any specific design pattern needs to be followed here and they have mentioned as well that they are not following any as such.
noProblem The overall structure of the code looks good and all the coding standards have been followed.
noProblem Most code changes were on UI, and written perfectly. No commits after first deadline, so same as first review.  
noProblem  I think their code is well written.
noProblem No new code was committed during the second round. This could be due to the fact that the team finished their code at the end of the first round itself.
noProblem No new commits.
noProblem No, but all the functionalities are working fine from 1st review itself.
noProblem  There are no new commits.
noProblem In the first round the team had only created the two Web IDL  files namely OffScreenCanvas.webidl and OffScreenCanvasRenderingContext2D.webidl; which are the interface files which define the implementation in the corresponding files offscreencanvas.rs and offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs. In this round the team has implemented the functionalities described in the two Web IDL files in offscreencanvas.rs and offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs. The offscreencanvas.rs interacts with the javascript and hence has the constructor with attributes height and width; a method getContext() to return the reference to OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2d; and a reflector object for garbage collection. The offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs file does not interact directly with Javascript and does not have a constructor or reflector object. It has the code to build the offscreencanvas object.  On inspection, the variable and method names used in the code are intuitive. But the main issue is that the name of the webidl file OffScreenCanvasRenderingContext2D.webidl and corresponding Rust file offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs don't match. The team could have formatted the code appropriately for readable indentation. There are not many comments that give a high level description of the code. Instead there are some instances of unnecessary code that has been commented. The code is indeed DRY.
noProblem No new commits made during the second round, as the functionality seems completed in the first round itself.
noProblem There is no new commits during the 2nd round.
noProblem The code seems to be good. It follows the principle of good design. Even though I do not know RUST, the use of variable names was very intuitive.
noProblem The code doesn't make sense to me, someone who isn't familiar with this project, but it does seem to be formatted well.
noProblem There are only minor modifications and they are well written. I don't think there is any other way it could be done. 
noProblem The code changes are majorly on html files. Capybara could have been used to test the functionalities The code coverage has increased overall.
noProblem  There is no new test and the coverage did not increase.
noProblem Yes, there is 
noProblem Tests have been thoroughly and very well performed. Also, well documented. 
noProblem The code seems to be written well. The Ruby style guide is followed.
noProblem Team added elaborate Test plans and implementation for their test cases.
noProblem Some commits were made to rectify old errors and get an approved pull request
noProblem  Everything works like expected.
noProblem Yes it works as intended. From the video, it seems everything is working fine.
noProblem Yes, new code has been committed in the 2nd round. The team has essentially implemented the offscreencanvas.rs and offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs. offscreencanvas.rs is respondible for implementing the OffscreenCanvas.webidl. This interacts directly with javascript and when a new instance of offscreencanvas is created, it calls the constructor with arguments height and width which in turn calls the new method defined in this file. It also contains the reflector object that tells the Javascript garbage collector to ignore the canvas object while clearing memory. Additionally, it has the implementation of the getContext() method that returns a weak reference to OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2d, which is responsible for doing background rendering task. offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs has the implementation of OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2D. It does not interact directly with JavaScript, so it does not have the Constructor or reflector. The functionality to build an offscreencanvas object has been implemented in this file.  
noProblem Yes there new commits in round 2.
noProblem The writeup has been pretty well written by the team. Introduction to the problem statement, the implementation details, and the test plans have been stated.  
noProblem The writeup is accurate and sufficient, the team gives clear explanations for the whole project and the process to realize it. For the point that is not easy to understand, they provided some examples and use mathematics method to support the explantation, which makes the read easily.
noProblem Several new commits were added during the second round.
noProblem The writeup is elaborate, well written, with proper description of the test cases with screenshots and steps for each issue.
noProblem  Overall, I think the write up is good and clear.
noProblem Well documented and explained with good amount of screenshots. Also the video length has been reduced to only whatever needs to be shown, which is great.
noProblem The authors have improved the writeup based on the suggestions from first review.  It is more precise and self explanatory. The background is lot clear after the first review.
noProblem The team has made a great improvement with respect to the previous submission. The code is brief and easy to understand.
noProblem I do feel the code can be deployed to the production server once a few test cases have been implemented by the team.
noProblem Test cases are yet to be added
noProblem The changes can be deployed to production server.
noProblem Yes, it works as intended and code follows the ruby guidelines, the documentation is well explanatory.
noProblem  I think this code is ready to be deployed onto the server.
noProblem The team have done a great job and passed all their tests.
noProblem The team has suggested 2 methods to test. The first and the recommended method is using the existing automated tests for OffScreenCanvas feature. A new offscreen-canvas directory was added to tests and a new .ini file enables the new preference. The second approach is writing own test cases and a sample HTML file can be used to test if the OffscreenCanvas is rendered.
noProblem Travis CI has passed.
noProblem Every thing has passed, there is no conflict or build fail.
noProblem No test cases as this wasn't a testing project.
noProblem  Yes, the build pass in Travis CI.
noProblem The build passed with no conflicts in Travis CI.
noProblem The build passes
noProblem In the test plan section and on Git also I found no test cases written. There is testing done, however it is not what was desired.
noProblem The code was well written even in the first round.
noProblem The present test cases appear to be written fine.
noProblem No, the authors didn't improve the code.
noProblem To test the system operation the project has to be built and run. The Sample HTML file was used to render a Test Canvas as given in the Wiki
noProblem When tested the project does what was desired to be done.
noProblem The authors made a solid attempt at improving the writeup. However, there are still some issues. DOM was left undefined and the code was separated from the descriptions.
noProblem Write up is good, with code flow diagram and test plan (pull request).
noProblem  No new code was committed during the 2nd round of resubmission.
noProblem The Wiki is pretty much strong with plenty of info.
noProblem Yes since it was a unit test assignment, tests have been added and overall coverage has increased
noProblem Coverage went up by 8.4%, according to coveralls.
noProblem The write-up is lucid and has now incorporated the changes that were made in the round 2. It starts off by introducing Servo, Rust, OffScreenCanvas, web worker, Web IDL. The authors then describe the code flow using a flow chart which was really appealing. I especially liked the Under the hood section, which elucidated the files (OffscreenCanvas.webidl, OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2D.webidl, offscreencanvas.rs and offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs) that they modified/created in this project and their functionalities concisely. The write up then includes the code from the above four files and finally ends with the test plan with 2 approaches, links to pull request and references.
noProblem The write-up is good. I liked the use of the flow-chart to explain the flow of their code and explain the functionality. I think that this was the first write-up that used a flowchart.
noProblem  They added all the test cases! There is so much coverage now!
noProblem Overall coverage was increased by 8+ percentage. 
noProblem The writeup is the best part about the project. It describes clearly what and how the work is done. One can clearly understand their working strategy from the writeup.
noProblem The tests cover all the scenarios. Given that the problem statement is pretty open-ended, the changes fulfil the purpose.
noProblem Yes, It works .
noProblem I think it covers all of the scenarios, but don't quote me. I don't have a great understanding of review response map.
noProblem Since it is a unit test project with well-written tests, I don't see any issues why it can't be deployed to production
noProblem the test examples they showed are good. 
noProblem The build is passing successfully
noProblem Yes, I feel the code is written in a good format. I checked the changes made by the authors and didn't find any bad naming or anything else.
noProblem The code was well-written in the first round itself. The method names, variabble names and class names are intuitive and suggestive of the functionality.
noProblem The code is well written. No issues with naming conventions/coding style.
noProblem Impressed by the coding and the way the solution was implemented. They implemented a complex feature in simple lines of code. Coding standard has been followed, naming conventions are followed and code is formatted. 
noProblem The code is written really well. The professor frequently advised the team to improve the naming conventions as seen from the comments in the Pull Request. Suggestions: I still feel that the function review_reminder_email is a bit longer. 
noProblem yes new code was committed during the second round
noProblem There are 2 commits
noProblem Two commits were done during the 2nd round.
noProblem 2 new commits - to add additional features.
noProblem No new commits as fix was delivered in first round.
noProblem No commits were found. The last commit was 15 days back.  Suggestion: I feel that there should have been some commits as the pull request shows merge issues. The Travis CI build fails and the code climate is also not able to analyse the code. There should have been commits related to resolving these things. 
noProblem There is code committed during 2nd round.
noProblem They have added the test cases with context as "when participant is added to the assignment using CSV" and the test case covers the required functionality that was intended to be  implemented
noProblem Team has added tests for assignment_participant model which they have changed. As the requirement was just testing one component, this is sufficient, however testing the controller would have been a more through Integration test.
noProblem yes, team has added the test cases and they cover the portion tp check whether the email has been sent to or not.
noProblem The team has added test cases. The test coverage has increased.
noProblem Yes.
noProblem Yes everything is working as intended

noProblem The test plan is added and Rspec test has been added.Overall testing seems good,
noProblem No there were no conflicts and do not need to be resolved.
noProblem I couldn't test manually, but the videos show proper operation.
noProblem As per their screencast(shared on the gdrive link), the feature seems to be working locally. There is no Heroku deployment or a link to the VCL present.
noProblem The code is almost completed. Only a few final touches will make it ready to be deployed onto the production server. Maybe the future team can also work on it to achieve some more enhanced features.
noProblem This is not an Expertiza project.
noProblem The UI and system operation works as intended. The video provided clearly shows the issues that the team has handled.
noProblem According to their video, their code works well. 
noProblem The write up has seen significant improvement. Flow diagram has been made and screen casts have been added to show the flow. Screen casts have been added for both bugs and functionality. Very good job
noProblem Extremely well written Wiki Page, thorough and to the point with enough technical content and relevant screenshots pertaining to the before and after scenarios of the problem statements. Moreover, its a considerable improvement from the last submission where in they had nothing of the sort. 
noProblem The write-up is comprehensive and clearly mentions the filenames where the changes have been made. Moreover the team has explained the logic behind the code in the video provided which is really helpful. The team has done a good job with respect to that. They have added an flowchart image explaining the logic behind checkbox. This adds up to the readability of the project
noProblem The writeup is detailed and the authors have done a nice job. It covers issue, their solution, explanation of the solution and test plan.
noProblem Yes, there are only minor modifications and they are well justified.
noProblem The code seemed to be well written in the first round. But I dont see changes done in round 2. The github link provided shows last commit for Oct 21. Though I see that there are change made in the wiki which were required and are done well.
noProblem The code was well written even in the first round.
noProblem I don not think their code is good, because they did not solve the problems existing in the first round.
noProblem The present test cases appear to be written fine.
noProblem No, the authors didn't improve the code.
noProblem Seems at par with the coding standards
noProblem Did not find problems in the code in the first round. Follows ruby style guide, commented and good naming. Very well written.
noProblem No new commits have been made in the 2nd round
noProblem the latest commit is on 2nd of Nov.
noProblem No, they did not commit new code.
noProblem No new commits in the second round.
noProblem  No new code was committed during the 2nd round of resubmission.
noProblem Yes since it was a unit test assignment, tests have been added and overall coverage has increased
noProblem I cannot find any new test cases.
noProblem Last commit seems to be 11 days ago
noProblem No new commits have been made. All changes are in the documentation only.
noProblem No, they did not add new test case
noProblem I don't see any new commits for round 2, mostly nothing was needed
noProblem No new code was committed during the second round.

noProblem No new test were added but earlier tests are working.
noProblem  No the team did not add any new test cases. Coverage is low.
noProblem  They added all the test cases! There is so much coverage now!
noProblem Overall coverage was increased by 8+ percentage. 
noProblem The tests cover all the scenarios. Given that the problem statement is pretty open-ended, the changes fulfil the purpose.
noProblem Yes, It works .
noProblem The code was well written, DRY was not violated.
noProblem The code seems to be dry, and I had no issues with it in the 1st round.
noProblem It looks as good as round 1.
noProblem Naming looks good, they had already added comment to the code in the first review.
noProblem Don't see any DRY issues. Well Written Test code
noProblem The code is well written.  No suggestions.
noProblem The team has added test cases: 1. To check that if there is no rejoinder for the review then it redirects to new author feedback page. 2. To check that the other teammate is able to edit. 3. To check if the page is redirecting back to review. 4. To check if the rejoinder by a participant of a team is saved properly.  The overall coverage decreased from 48% to 47.601%. It decreased by 0.04%
noProblem No there had been no bad names or wrong conventions used even in round 1. so no change there. The team has made few modifications to beautify the code by using ternary conditions which did make the code elegant. No new comments added.

noProblem The number of commits since the 1st round is impressive.  Significant improvements have been done pertaining to naming, indentation and overall Code Climate issues.
noProblem No new commits with respect to code or functionality. Just few indentations,  comment changes and code beautifications done
noProblem The system operation from UI works as expected by the project. I was able to verify that the rejoinder is given by the team instead of team member. The rejoinder is also made easily available to the user, by providing easy navigation options to give feedback to reviewers, hence making the UI more user friendly. The Author feedback section contains the team's collective feedback to reviewers of particular assignments. Most of the task is to refactor code so that it complies with the new requirement of team rejoinders, and the features work as expected.
noProblem The projects works as intended. Some of the issues in the problem statement covers refactoring which has been properly handled by the team.
noProblem Test cases were added. Overall increase in the coverage range observed.
noProblem Yes, the team added relevant test cases which increased the overall coverage.

noProblem Yes the project was about testing and coverage has increased.
noProblem Nicely written wiki. 
noProblem The coverall showed that the Overall coverage increased (+3.2%) to 39.999% The coverage of the participant.rb file is 100%. So great job team! No suggestions.
noProblem The write up is simple and understandable. It starts off by describing about Expertiza, motivation behind the project, the tasks to do, list of classes that are modified and impacted by the change. I like how the authors have screenshots of both the existing code that is removed and the new code that is added in the pull request, which juxtaposes them and highlights the tasks in the problem statement and goals of the project. The write up then ends with the test plan which lists the test cases handled.
noProblem The code coverage was 100% in the 1st round.
noProblem YEs the project was a test project and the team has managed to achieve 100% coverage of the model. There was no increase in coverage from Round 1 to Round 2

The authors complement the descriptions of each test case with associated block of code and elaborate on the details of their inner workings.
noProblem The write-up and screen cast were both very explanatory. It included detailed code, the need for the test of partipant.rb and the use of the model. There was no change required from the initial write up.
noProblem The code is well organized and written & ready to be merged into the production server.
noProblem No test plan

noProblem yes 
noProblem Yes, as mentioned in the problem statement, the solution is delivered. It works fine. 
noProblem The functionality works and is evidenced by the video.
noProblem Yes, everything works.
noProblem The writeup written well. The team could have included snippets of their code instead of screenshots.
noProblem The write-up was very good, in the sense that it mentioned the high level view of the tasks first, and then dug deeper under the hood. But, it only showed what files they changed, and what it produced as a result. They could have also shown what is that they changed, or provided a link in the wiki. Yes, one can deduce that from the pull request too, but having a link or the content itself on the wiki is a big boon.
noProblem The writeup is well written and self explanatory. 
noProblem The writeup is great, in first round they did not have a test plan part. But they added it in the second part.
noProblem The code looks good.
noProblem No, its not as the coverage is increases by small amount.
noProblem The build did not pass in Travis CI. There were no conflicts that needed to be resolved.
noProblem Travis test has failed, I can see it in pull request page. Conflict has not been resolved.

noProblem yes the coverage has increased
noProblem They have added test cases but very limited. The code coverage was just 14 percent.
noProblem Yes the team has added tests. I am not sure of the increase in coverage as it is not mentioned in the doc. however, the team has very well explained how the tests were done and what areas they have tested.
noProblem The team did not add any test cases and the coverage remained the same.
noProblem The feature implementation was good. The TA can't edit the rubric of the instructor. But the test cases are very limited.
noProblem The team added test cases for test_case.rb and the coverage has increased. which makes the overall coverage increases relatively a large extent.
noProblem Following the steps, I can see the changes implemented.
noProblem Yes, everything that the project required to do works. There were a few things which caused issues in the pull request, but none of it related to the functionality of the product to be tested, but rather related to the code complexity. Even the video demonstration clearly shows the changes implemented.
noProblem I think it is well written, quite understandable. It clearly and adequately indicates the working functionality. I can understand what the project is about.
noProblem The team vastly improved on the writeup from the first stage by giving a general overview of the tasks taken up and the list of issues present and resolved during the project. 
noProblem The team didn't no provide the link for the deployment, but according to the video they provided, the features worked well.
noProblem The code seems ready for merge
noProblem Yes, it is ready.
noProblem If it works just like in the video then definitely yes.
noProblem The feature implementation was good. The TA can't edit the rubric of the instructor. But the test cases are very limited.
noProblem Since, the changes are reflecting, it looks good to be merged.
noProblem The test cases covers the required test scenarios and the system operates as intended. The video file submitted though seems to crash. A link could have helped.
noProblem Yes, the code can be deployed on the production server as it passes the needed build of Travis CI. The project would work as required to.
noProblem I think it is well written, quite understandable. It clearly and adequately indicates the working functionality. I can understand what the project is about.
noProblem Travis-CI Passes
noProblem Yes, the build request has been passed.
noProblem I could not find Travis CI
noProblem Travis tests have passed. There were some initial failures but the team has fixed it. There are no lingering failures.
noProblem the build passes
noProblem The code is almost perfect, apart from the code complexity issues, which in my view isn't very tough to fix. The project need not be done from scratch, and it is certainly a good starting place for future teams to pick up.
noProblem The code seems ready for merge
noProblem The team gave fixtures for the issues exist, but to make deployment, it is better to add more tests to make sure the function work properly.
noProblem Yes, the code can be deployed on the production server as it passes the needed build of Travis CI. The project would work as required to.
noProblem Since, the changes are reflecting, it looks good to be merged.

noProblem No new commits have been made in round 2.
noProblem All the commits were completed by Oct 31
noProblem No commits were done in 2nd round.
noProblem the last commit I see is from Oct 31st.I'm assuming they did not have to change much in the 2nd round
noProblem No Commit,
noProblem A small amount of new code was committed in the second round.
noProblem No new commits were made during the second round.
noProblem No new commits have been made since the last round. However, there is nothing significant as just codeclimate fixes are remaining.
noProblem I couldn't any new  commits in the second submission, though the functionality seemed to be fulfilled in the first round itself.
noProblem Yes, the coverage has increased and has almost reached to 50%.
noProblem This project is refactoring and there were not much of functionality changes, I see that teams have changed the existing tests make sure there is no coverage miss
noProblem The test coverage seems to have increased slightly. Since this is a refactoring project, I wouldn't expect testing to be the focus, so that's pretty good even though the added test case most likely doesn't cover all the work done here.
noProblem The team had added a test case in the last round, which I think was sufficient to test basic functionality.  There have been no additions to test cases in the second round.
noProblem Team added several test cases, and the coverage was seen to increase
noProblem Yes the code addresses all issues.
noProblem Yes, refactoring did not impact on the existing operation at all.
noProblem The system operation works as intended.

noProblem overall it is well written, they can add reference section where they can put the link to the project etc.
noProblem The write-up is to the point and explains their approach neatly. The team has made efforts to update the write-up with the provided suggestions and it has improved the write-up.
noProblem The writeup was elaborate, and fully elucidated the test added and the removed methods and SQL lines and their scope. 
noProblem I strongly believe that this code is ready for production server
noProblem Changes are working perfectly.
noProblem I think this code is ready to go, because it is better organized and structured than it used to be.
noProblem I think that it is a neatly written code and once the integration issues have been resolved, it should be ready to be deployed on th production server.  The code being readable, can be easily picked up by the future team.
noProblem build is passing on Travis CI. there are no pending conflicts
noProblem Ignoring this question since it is an OSS project.
noProblem Though there were several build fails during the first round which seem to have been triggered on bundle exec, the final build passes in Travis CI
noProblem The code is not altered much but it follows the standards and not changed in the second round
noProblem Code is written well with simplified approach. Naming conventions are standard without long functions. DRY principle is followed.
noProblem Well, the code looks good and very much follows the Ruby Style Guide. The code also is DRY. It looks well written and does not any changes.
noProblem New code commit was not made in second round
noProblem Could not see any commits after the last submission as functionalities were working fine, but team could have worked upon improving test coverage.
noProblem No, no new code was committed during 2nd round.
noProblem No Commits
noProblem No new code was committed during the 2nd round.
noProblem Team s last commit was on Oct 31st , which was the first deadline.

noProblem Yes, test cases were written for admin_controller and roles_controller. The test cases increased the coverage as well. Every method in these files are tested and covers a good range of this project.
noProblem When open from the UI, working fine and as expected. No refactoring required.  
noProblem Yes, the system operation works well. All the functionalities mentioned work properly.
noProblem Code works.
noProblem Yes, the system works fine and as intended. The features work as they are supposed to.
noProblem They had to create a superuser who has a right to delete other users . When checked these functionalities were working upto 80% expectation. The tests written do cover the portion assigned to them and the tests are thorough.
noProblem It is well written, quite understandable. It clearly and adequately indicates the working functionality. I can understand what the project is about.
noProblem Very well written.
noProblem The write-up is well organized but it would have been better if some screenshots were uploaded along with the steps. That would have made the document easier to understand.
noProblem The writeup is short and precise - has everything that is needed for testing and understanding and kept the writeup small for better understanding. They have mentioned about their DRY principle within "Changes" itself. Mentioning it as a separate sub topic will give more visibility is what I felt. Other than that everything is self explanatory.
noProblem The writeup is well written. It covers almost all the work done. However, one suggestion would be to include more details about hoe the tests were done. I just one small portion dedicated to explanation of RSpec and not the work implemented.
noProblem No it should go through more edge cases testing
noProblem As mentioned above, the functionalities work well. So, yeah this can deployed on the production server.
noProblem After fixing the issues suggested by code climate, the code can be deployed.

noProblem Yes it is ready to be deployed.
noProblem Code looks okay, Suggestions for improvements not done.  build still fails   
noProblem They don't have code problem for the first round.
noProblem No the new code was not committed during the second round. This could be due to the fact that the team finished their code at the end of the first round itself.

noProblem No new commits. 
noProblem Travis CI says tests have failed but these don't include the tests written by the team.
noProblem No new commit during second round.
noProblem The Travis CI build passed , the code does not have any conflicts with the master. Initially (stage 1) a lot of changes were made so that the Travis CI build would pass. Kudos for effort!
noProblem Yes, the team did add test cases to test their changes and their overall test coverage has increased.
noProblem The code seems to same as before. nothing new has been added.
noProblem The code has passed the Travis CI build has passed. The danger build has also passed with one warning because of more that 500 Lines of Code. On the other hand the codeclimate build has failed with 7 issues to fix.  1. There is a method get_feedback_assessments_for which has a Cognitive Complexity of 9 (which exceeds 5) and must be refactored. 2. The model class Team contains 21 methods (which is more than the 20 allowed) and hence has to be refactored. 3. The method view_heatgrid has 28 Lines of code that exceeds the allowed 20 and hence has to be refactored. 4. The method set_content has a Cognitive Complexity of 6 (which exceeds the allowed 5) and hence has to be refactored 5. Presence of an unescaped model attribute in the file app/views/response/view.html.erb 6. Assignment Branch condition size for get_feedback_assessments_for is too high 7. Indentation issues in app/models/assignment_participant.rb There are no conflicts with the base branch.
noProblem Yes, the team did add test cases and the coverage increased too. But the team didn't put any efforts after the initial review round, since the failed tests are still failed, and there are no new commits since 12 days.
noProblem The build has passed and there have not been any conflicts.
noProblem The team has added test cases and they cover all the required functionality. The code coverage has increased by a small amount.
noProblem The CI build has passed and there are no conflicts.
noProblem Many test cases were added, with overall test coverage increasing for the project.
noProblem They did add the test-cases but the coverage only increased by .3 %
noProblem Overall coverage increased (+0.3%) to 37.074% Good work on including test cases. The app works fine after testing. The newly added tests cover the scope of this project very well.

noProblem  The last commit was 12 days ago. I believe that this team had finished their work well before round 1 itself. I think they had planned the work well in advance and followed that plan as well.
noProblem There were really few commits in the 2nd round. The only commit I could see was on 30th October. The only suggestion I would give is to continuously update their work on git. 
noProblem There is no new commit during the 2nd round.
noProblem No new test cases added, but the existing ones had a good coverage too.
noProblem Overall test coverage  was decreased by 35%.
noProblem No need for adding new test cases as the previous submission already achieved 100% coverage. I apologize for not being certain how to accurately answer this question.
noProblem They didn't add test cases, but the test coverage is always above 90%.
noProblem There are no new tests and that is because the team had already completed their work before deadline 1 and the coverage was 100% on the deadline one itself so there is basically no scope for improvement for this team.
noProblem The team did add test cases. They achieved a little more than the desired coverage even , that means they have done a great work.
noProblem The team added test cases for menu.rb and the coverage increases but the overall coverage seems decrease due to that.
noProblem From the video, the functionality works well.

noProblem The project has a good coverage of the codes 
noProblem The writeup is well documented
noProblem The write up is very informative and clearly shows the impact and result of the project tests. It would have been a great addition to have included more discussion on the design choices of your testcases and how it was implemented. Overall a great wiki.
noProblem The writeup is pretty good and easy to follow.
noProblem I loved the write-up. Write from the beginning to explaining Expertiza to explaining their task and the test plan which was very detailed and methodical. I also like that they had included a screen shot of the Mutant test which shows the thoroughness of their tests. Overall an impressive job by the authors.
noProblem The writeup is well written and clearly tells the flow and method of working. It shows clearly what all work is done and how it is done. It mentions specifically the explanation of each functionality and how it is checked.
noProblem The writeup gives an easy-understanding introduction of the two classes the team needed to test. Also, there is detailed test plan is provided. The wiki also shows how the test cases are designed and the results. However, for the motivation part, it is a little bit general, which needs to add more things specific for this project.
noProblem a Lot of refactoring is required before the code goes on to production server.
noProblem The team gives a good guidelines for how to test and what to test for the two classes.
noProblem Travis CI failed.

noProblem The write-up is well written explaining all the steps undertaken to make desired changes and displaying how the system works after the changes have been made (with screenshots). They have also added Test plans in the wiki page
noProblem Pretty nicely written Wiki. Test Plan also describes how various tests were performed.
noProblem It is well written, quite understandable. It clearly and adequately indicates the working functionality. I can understand what the project is about.
noProblem Yes the write up is good, if they were able to host it'd have been better for checking the work. 
noProblem The write up is well written, elaborate, and clearly elucidates both the manual test cases considered as well as the automated tests implemented. Screenshots of both cases were also included as well. Steps for manual testing were clearly written.
noProblem The team has considerably improved the write-up. The write-up was very inefficient and dint provide details of the code-base also the video was encoded and impossible to view in Round 1. The team has rectified all these issues with round 2. they have documented their fixed more clearly with screen shots and code this time. 
noProblem It can be deployed but first, it should be tested thoroughly. 
noProblem I think the changes are tested nicely and seem to cover all the necessary cases. This can be merged into the master branch and is ready for production use
noProblem Its ready to be merged.
noProblem In my opinion, this team has done pretty good work and the code looks like ready to be deployed on the production server.

noProblem The writeup is great, in first round they did not have a test plan part. But they added it in the second part.
noProblem The code looks good.
noProblem No, its not as the coverage is increases by small amount.
noProblem build fails that needs to be investigated , once that is done i dont see why the project cannot be merged with the mail branch. Loot of good work has been done and merge with the main branch would bring the work to fruition.  
noProblem Code is short, variables and functions are well-named.
noProblem the code is very well written. there are no bad names, long functions or any lack of comments. The code written by the team is self-explanatory.
noProblem The code follows the DRY principles correctly
noProblem The variables, methods and class names are aptly named. I could not find names which are not suggestive of functionality. (i) The writeup is well written and easy to read and well commented (ii) It is adequately descriptive of the work done. (iii) Explanation of reasons for the style of code and problem solving approach is lacking.
noProblem The code is concise and easy to understand. The team has provided comments to explain the logic of the new function created which really helps.

noProblem great writeup.
noProblem The document is well written with all the required details.
noProblem meaningful test
noProblem There does not seem any issues with the code. The team has properly used the naming convention and has provided comments wherever necessary

noProblem Few new commits are made
noProblem There has been 2 commits made in second round. One for adding comments and another one for fixing Issue #926 the sorting of topics by topic number in assignments.
noProblem Fantastic wiki! Extremely informative about your project. 
noProblem 3 New commits
noProblem Properly done in round 2 also
noProblem The team has done few commits. One was on few sort fixes, while they other was on refactoring.

noProblem No New Tests
noProblem The writeup is written in a verbose manner. The test plan is also mentioned.  No suggestions. 
noProblem Yes, team has added the test case
noProblem written up is also a brilliant work!
noProblem As mentioned above, the team did a really good job at this. The writeup talks in detail what all tests did the team implement, and from the pull request, we can make out that the team was pretty consistent with their efforts. 
noProblem Yes, it works as intended
noProblem Unfortunately, I could not see any code written by the team for testing. However, the team has provided a description on how some of the edge cases have been handled. According to coveralls, the overall test has decreased by 0.01%. This could be one of the major topics for improvements with regards to this issue
noProblem Tests have been thoroughly and very well performed. Also, well documented. 
noProblem Yes the features work as described in the problem statement. The team has done good job and has fixed all the below issues: Issue #971 Change create topic UI into AJAX. Issue #926 We need a way to sort topics by topic number in assignment#edit page. Issue #718 We should allow instructors to give feedback when accepting or rejecting topic suggestions.
noProblem The code works as required.
noProblem The new features work as expected.
noProblem As explained in the video, the build seems to work fine.

noProblem The working is perfect, everything works as intended. The team has explained this in a brief manner in their youtube video.
noProblem System works as expected and this is evidenced by tests and videos.
noProblem The build successfully passes Travis CI.
noProblem The write-up is informative and provides all necessary details of the changes made.
noProblem Yes, everything works. Well done!
noProblem All scenarios mentioned in the writeup are properly covered.
noProblem  They covered all the scenarios.
noProblem The write up is impressive and very detailed. It has been documented well which helps to understand about the project and the code implementation. It also provides detailed test plan which makes it easier for end user to do UI testing.
noProblem The code coverage of 100% satisfies the minimum criteria. It works as intended which can be seen in the video. The tests covers all the scenarios for passing them. 
noProblem The tests execute perfectly well and this has been demonstrated by the video. No suggestions.
noProblem cover all!
noProblem The writeup is well organized and well documented.
noProblem This team already had full coverage. I am not sure how to answer this question as new tests were not needed. 
noProblem Yes, the team did added test cases, which have been clearly mentioned in the write-up. Although the results image isn't clearly visible, but it is still enough to figure out the team passed 100% of the test cases.
noProblem Yes they have add some test cases, and the coverage increased.
noProblem The commits show equal contribution by all team members.
noProblem The team's project is unit testing the menu.rb model file. Hence they added Rspec test code in spec/models/menu_spec.rb. The pull request indicates that the overall coverage increased by a significant 5.5%. The report tells cites that 5779 lines have been covered and 13673 lines are relevant.
noProblem Well written with understandable content
noProblem The code was very well-written and up to to servo standards.
noProblem Writeup is very detailed and well written. It is supplemented by enough code pieces and reasoning and good amount of pictures and videos to explain what the team has done in detail.
noProblem This code seems to be well structured and written
noProblem  I think with proper testing, this code is ready to be deployed onto the production server.
noProblem Commits were made in second round 
noProblem Yes, It was committed and the changes were merged
noProblem Yes new code was added and committed during the 2nd round that implements oscillator node example to exercise different oscillator types and generate triangle waveform.
noProblem The code has passed the travis test and has addressed  all the issues of the Change Request. The code should be production ready after adding few more edge test case scenarios.  
noProblem Yes, new commits were made during the second round.
noProblem No new test cases were added
noProblem Yes, the code can be deployed to production.
noProblem I don't see any tests in this project.
noProblem The team's test plan includes running the oscillator binary file using the command ./oscillator. This will run the oscillator.rs where various oscillator nodes corresponding to sine, square, sawtooth and triangle waveforms are generated. Hence, the user will be able to listen to these waves after a definite interval.
noProblem It's working.
noProblem Apart from some code-climate change, the code seems to be ready to merged
noProblem I'm not really sure how to categorize this project, but it seems to be structured and implemented properly.
noProblem The writeup was really well explained.
noProblem Writeup is good and understandable. Test plan is written well indicating the steps clearly in what needs to be done to test.
noProblem Well-written and self explanatory.
noProblem The writeup starts off by introducing Servo- Mozilla's experimental high performance browser engine and Rust- which is a systems programming language with memory safety and concurrency used to build Servo. It then moves over to Web Audio API for handling audio operations inside audio context and allow modular routing, and a workflow for implementing Web Audio was clearly listed. It then flows into the scope of the project and the implementation. The graphical and mathematical representation of the sine, square, sawtooth and triangle waveform gave a solid conceptual foundation. The code snippet of the changes done in oscillator_node.rs and the new file oscillator.rs (created by the team) has also been included. The section Build that explains the procedure to install dependencies (Rust), step by step procedure for building and running the build was very useful to explore the project. The team had included the build instructions for Windows and Debian-based Linux. They could have augmented the build instructions for Mac OS X, which might save Mac Users from reading verbose instructions on the official documentation and instead refer to a single source (the wiki). The authors end the wiki by providing the test plan with examples of generated sine, square, sawtooth and triangle waveforms as audio files; pull request and references.
noProblem no new added tests but the team had managed to get 100% test coverage in first round.
noProblem Yes the Travis CI build is passing successfully.  
noProblem The commits show equal contribution by all team members.
noProblem Well written with understandable content
noProblem The code was very well-written and up to to servo standards.
noProblem The writeup is very detailed and gave me a good idea of what was going on with this project.
noProblem This code seems to be well structured and written
noProblem Commits were made in second round 
noProblem Yes, It was committed and the changes were merged
noProblem Yes new code was added and committed during the 2nd round that implements oscillator node example to exercise different oscillator types and generate triangle waveform.
noProblem Yes, new commits were made during the second round.
noProblem No conflicts and Build Passes
noProblem  They add test cases for the first round and the coverage increases, however, they did not add more in second round.
noProblem It is already deployed on the production server
noProblem No test cases present but test plan covers it.
noProblem The project is in great shape and has already been merged to the servo repository on Github which means that it is production ready. The team has fixed the few formatting issues pointed by a servo team member.  The approach taken up by the team is in line with what is expected of them and it is a good start to advance the Webaudio API of the servo browser engine in the future.
noProblem Yes no conflicts at all which needs to be resolved
noProblem I believe this code is ready to be deployed, and if it isn't, it can definitely be picked up in the future.
noProblem The team did not add or improve any team cases from the first round. The full path coverage of 100% was already achieved in the first stage.
noProblem Yes, the Travis CI has passed.
noProblem The build has passed in Travis CI and no conflicts have occured.
noProblem The build passes and there are only minor warnings and issues which can safely be ignored.
noProblem Coveralls shows the following : Overall coverage increased (+5.5%) to 42.266% The coverage of menu.rb has increased to 100%. Great job team! No suggestions.
noProblem The team's test plan includes running the oscillator binary file using the command ./oscillator. This will run the oscillator.rs where various oscillator nodes corresponding to sine, square, sawtooth and triangle waveforms are generated. Hence, the user will be able to listen to these waves after a definite interval.
noProblem It's working.
noProblem 100% coverage
noProblem This project doesn't involve the UI. It focusses on audio processing by fixing the missing audio nodes in Servo's WebAudio standard. Precisely it generates the sine, square, sawtooth and triangle waveforms. The code that was modified and included from scratch works as intended. 
noProblem 2 Commit during 2nd round.
noProblem I'm not really sure how to categorize this project, but it seems to be structured and implemented properly.
noProblem As mentioned earlier, no new commits were added by the author.
noProblem Yes, this team has been keeping push new commits during the 2nd round.
noProblem There was a commit during the 2nd round. This was made after the user codeclimate pointed out a few issues with respect to the indentation and lengthy code. 
noProblem Yes, new commits were added in the second round to fix the code climate issue
noProblem Yes, the code climate issues were resolved.
noProblem No new commits were found. But this was because the project was already done and did not need any changes.  No suggestions.
noProblem The writeup is very detailed and gave me a good idea of what was going on with this project.
noProblem modify some to make it drier.
noProblem There are some new commits in the 2nd round.
noProblem Their code is pretty good, and they solved most of the problems.
noProblem well done! 100% cover. 
noProblem The writeup was really well explained.
noProblem The code is well written. No suggestions.
noProblem The code follows the Ruby style guide and makes good use of the Better specs documentation for writing Rspec test. The team has also made an extensive use of the describe and construct contexts which helps to understand the code written.
noProblem   They do not have these problems in the first round.          
noProblem Writeup is good and understandable. Test plan is written well indicating the steps clearly in what needs to be done to test.
noProblem Well-written and self explanatory.
noProblem I believe this code is ready to be deployed, and if it isn't, it can definitely be picked up in the future.

noProblem It is already deployed on the production server
noProblem This is not an expertiza project, but the pull request does pass.
noProblem Not an expertiza project.
noProblem The code was not much changed after the first round. They added a few more sanitation check and rspec. Functions are not long enough and understandable.
noProblem I think the code looks good and very much follows the Ruby Style Guide. The code also is DRY. It looks well written and does not any changes.
noProblem  The code is extremly well-written.
noProblem Videos and code explained very well.
noProblem Yes some of the issues were fixed.
noProblem The code was written clearly, DRY, and intuitive to follow the intended functionality.
noProblem Yes rspec and few changes were committed
noProblem Yes, a lot of commits were made mostly to fix the issues pointed out by the CI tools
noProblem Yes, there were many parts of the code committed during round 2.
noProblem 5 new commits were made during second round
noProblem Yes
noProblem The team has a really good job of committing their code on a regular basis. There has been some code commits even in the 2nd round. 
noProblem Yes, there were few new commits
noProblem Yes there were some commits fixing the travis and code climate issues.
noProblem Yes, the team actively committed to the project during the second round.
noProblem The team seems to have thoroughly tested the use case and the coverage has increased.
noProblem Yes, the team has added test cases and it covers all the functionalities and issues.
noProblem No new test cases were added
noProblem Video showing test cases passed. Good Job!
noProblem YEs, the team has included the relevant test cases to test their changes and the overall coverage has increased by 0.04% which I think covers the scope of this project.
noProblem Coverage increased by 0.04%
noProblem Automated and manual tests have been added and coverage has increased by a very tiny amount.
noProblem Yes the team did add test cases that increased coverage. They are appropriate for the scope of the project.
noProblem Yes the team has added test for the UTF encoding acceptance. the coverage is not 100% and not tested with varied inputs but i believe would suffice for sanity check. Although the description of test in rspec file is ambiguous not clearly mentioning what exactly the test is expected to do. There is no test available for the issue 2 documented
noProblem Videos provided and the project is not deployed so cannot test from UI. But the issues are fixed and the system is working as expected. 
noProblem My testing shows things seem to be working as expected and documented.
noProblem The deployment link hasn't been provided. Though they have put videos for the same
noProblem It works as intended.
noProblem Yes code works.
noProblem From the video links that have been shared, it is very clear that the features are working as they were supposed to. Even the test cases are passing. I see no issues with this part.
noProblem Looking from videos all the intended features work
noProblem Yes the code works has expected. it accepts the utf-8 codes now and also parses HTML tags in reviews like expected
noProblem The write-up is well written explaining all the steps undertaken to make desired changes and displaying how the system works after the changes have been made (with screenshots). They have also added Test plans in the wiki page
noProblem Pretty nicely written Wiki. Test Plan also describes how various tests were performed.
noProblem It is well written, quite understandable. It clearly and adequately indicates the working functionality. I can understand what the project is about.
noProblem Properly explained write up, with old and new changes.
noProblem The writeup I must say has been one of the best I have seen so far. It clearly mentions all the issues that they were facing and were asked to tackle. The solutions are well documented as well. The screenshots help in understanding the problems that they fixed.
noProblem Yes the write up is good, if they were able to host it'd have been better for checking the work. 
noProblem The write up is well written, elaborate, and clearly elucidates both the manual test cases considered as well as the automated tests implemented. Screenshots of both cases were also included as well. Steps for manual testing were clearly written.
noProblem The team has considerably improved the write-up. The write-up was very inefficient and dint provide details of the code-base also the video was encoded and impossible to view in Round 1. The team has rectified all these issues with round 2. they have documented their fixed more clearly with screen shots and code this time. 
noProblem It can be deployed but first, it should be tested thoroughly. 
noProblem I think the changes are tested nicely and seem to cover all the necessary cases. This can be merged into the master branch and is ready for production use
noProblem Watching the videos, I feel it is ready but no deployment link.
noProblem As It did not pass the test, it is not ready. For a future team, end of this project should be a good starting place.
noProblem Its ready to be merged.
noProblem In my opinion, this team has done pretty good work and the code looks like ready to be deployed on the production server.
noProblem According to write up, it's good to go but since there is no deployed link I couldn't manually check.
noProblem Yes, just fix the few issues present and that should be fine for it to be merged into main line as the feature seems to work and there isn't any major code issue.
noProblem I believe this change that affects the system as a whole, needs more test to be performed in all affected tables and functions to be sure, no other part of the system is broken.My opinion is that, once all parts of the system test is done, corresponding to this centralized db change the code can be deployed to production.
noProblem Build did pass successfully. Could have written version specific code to avoid errors
noProblem Pull request build passes well and there are issues.
noProblem No, It did not pass travis ci and there are many conflicts that must be resolved.
noProblem Few minor issues with the build which can be ignored.
noProblem The travis ci test passes.
noProblem The build passed in Travis CI with no conflicts.
noProblem Not all changes has been verified successfully. few code climates rejects has happened as well. 
noProblem The code was already delivered in the first round. Hence, no commits this round. The author has regularly pushed commits. 
noProblem Team has added many tests. Coverage has increased from 1 to 38%, which is impressive. 
noProblem Yes, as mentioned in the problem statement, the solution is delivered. It works fine. 
noProblem The last commits were 12 days earlier, hence no new commits were made during the second round.
noProblem Yes, the team did add test cases and the coverage increased too. But the team didn't put any efforts after the initial review round, since the failed tests are still failed, and there are no new commits since 12 days.
noProblem Yes, the project did work as intended. The video demonstration and manual testing were enough to prove this fact.
noProblem The code is well written and well commented and follows ruby style guide.
noProblem Very good guidance. Works as intended. This project is about enhancing Juniper bookmarks. The features work as they are supposed to. Automated RSpec tests were added. Could have described the automated tests in the wiki.
noProblem No issues codewise. Can add test cases and after thorough testing It can be deployed. Yes other team can take up and fix the minor issues and build pass.
noProblem The write-up is very detailed with comparisons between previous and new versions, as to what features have been implemented but lacks on explaining how they are implemented. It can be improved by adding how the features have been implemented, why they chose this logic to implement the features.
noProblem They don't have code problem for the first round.
noProblem No new commit during second round.
noProblem Yes, everything works.
noProblem The writeup is great, in first round they did not have a test plan part. But they added it in the second part.
noProblem No new commits. 
noProblem The testing has been implemented and looks well implemented.
noProblem The functionality works and is evidenced by the video.
noProblem No. I do not think the code is ready to be deployed. I found the code change hard to understand, there are no comments and neither has the logic or rationale behind the new/changed code been given in the wiki. Besides, the build fails and there are a host of issues that need to be fixed.  Although all this might only be trivial issues and can be fixed rather easily, the code as of now, is not deployment-ready according to me. 
noProblem Yes 1 checkin was done on nov 2nd   
noProblem yes 
noProblem No new code was committed in the second round.
noProblem The writeup needs significant improvement. "No clear explanation is given as to which files are edited for which reason. Only file names are stated along with changes made. Why the changes were made and what do those changes correct is not given." - This review was given by me last time,and no improvement has been made in this regard.
noProblem Yes,coding practices seem upto standards
noProblem Doesn't seem to have new commits in round 2. last commit was on 2nd November
noProblem Seems to be working as intended. But all the features have not been implemented. The documentation mentions future work but no new code has been added.
noProblem No, all the features have not been implemented e.g 1. A reviewer can be recognized or credited if he added useful bookmarks i.e if the author has made use of the bookmark. 2. A function to add badges automatically if a participant had submitted more than threshold number of useful bookmarks. plus build did not pass as well
noProblem Overall the quality of code is great. There some variable which does not follow naming convection.
noProblem Yes, they were made.
noProblem Yes there is one conflict that must be resolved to go ahead reported by TRAVIS CI.
noProblem They did add the test-cases but the coverage only increased by .3 %
noProblem Yes, it works as intended.
noProblem The writeup is well written and self explanatory. 
noProblem No, its not as the coverage is increases by small amount.
noProblem Yes everything does seem to work properly. 
noProblem Since the Travis test has failed, merging the code would not be a good idea. The project doesn't need to be redone from scratch, some modifications to the existing work could make the project ready for deployment.
noProblem There are a few issues regarding code repetition and extra white space (especially in the controller rspec file).
noProblem No new code was added, nor was any necessary.
noProblem Many test cases were added, with overall test coverage increasing for the project.
noProblem It seems that everything works, though it was hard/confusing to find everything as per the instructions on the write-up.
noProblem The code looks good.
noProblem very nice code, easy to read and understand.
noProblem The code written by the team satisfies the basic functionality expected. The team followed the comments from previous round of using good naming conventions for certain variables.
noProblem Travis build : passed.
noProblem the build passed in Travis CI.
noProblem Yes, the Travis CI is passed. No conflict that are remain do be resolved.
noProblem The team has presented a working deployment to be possible. It passes most of the builds and can be deployed on the production server. 
noProblem Yes, apart from the 7 issues of minor severity from codeclimate, the code is perfectly well to integrate with the project. No, the project need not be planned and executed from scratch, it is implemented well enough.
noProblem The team has worked on improving the wiki document. The writeup now includes the Test plan section  that was suggested in the first round specifying the how the team setup an expertiza environment, the model functions used and the mock instance built for testing the model file. 
noProblem The write-up is well written in my thought, it is clear and understandable.
noProblem very nice writeup.
noProblem The system operation is verified and works as intended as demonstrated from the video. Also, all the test scenarios are covered.
noProblem nil test were added, all scenarios are covered.
noProblem The project successfully covered all the scenarios.
noProblem Yes, the team covered all the scenarios I could have come up with. I specially appreciate the work that they've put into the import functionality. They have come with with more scenarios than I could have even thought of, and tested it pretty thoroughly. 
noProblem Build says the overall coverage decreased but the coverage of the  Test has increased.
noProblem The team did not add any test cases since they had achieved a 100% coverage in the first round itself. However, certain changes made to the test cases included using proper naming conventions for attributes and following the DRY principle effectively throughout the model file.
noProblem They reached 100% at first round.
noProblem Coverage was already at 100%.
noProblem 100 percent coverage.
noProblem The coverage is 100% since the first round. It seems there's no newly added tests.
noProblem Yes, the team covered 100% of the code they had to test. Also, the video given in the link was very informative and helped to understand the implications of the work done by the team to a far greater extent.
noProblem Yes new commit is done for second review,
noProblem Involves fixing code climate issues. 
noProblem yes, new code committed during the 2nd round.
noProblem There's no upload for the local folder. It seems that no new pull requests has been committed during the 2nd round, so I would guess no new code being committed for the 2nd round.
noProblem yes, the authors have improved the code. the team has worked on the issue which I mentioned in the previous review. The code doesn't seems to be confusing now but it still needs proper commenting to be done. 
noProblem They haven't made any change since round 1 review. Haven't changed the naming as well eg topic_id1 doesn't seem right to me. But other than 1 or 2 names, everything else looks clean. Also you haven't added comments to you code. YOu should add comments when working in a open source project.
noProblem A few comments could be included in code to make it more clear.
noProblem Suggested changes related to naming convention are not included in the 2nd round.  variable names : rop_topic_deadline1 , topic_id1 Puts statements are not removed : p topic_id1   Other than this the code is properly written following coding best practices.  
noProblem The code is well written. I did not see any bad naming conventions or bad coding style.  
noProblem there is only one commit made during the entire project. there is no new code added during the 2nd round.
noProblem There has been only one commit for the entire project.
noProblem Commits were made in second round 
noProblem No. There was a single commit throughout the project period and that was during the 1st round.
noProblem No commits were done in round 2.
noProblem Nothing changed since round 1. Haven't added a shorter video or a video with sound. Haven't made naming changes.
noProblem No, the code was last committed on Oct 31st.
noProblem There were no new commits in the 2nd round.
noProblem I don't see any code changes after the first round.
noProblem No need for test cases. (+1 for mentioning it in the Wiki!)
noProblem No test cases present but test plan covers it.
noProblem No, the team did not add any test cases and the coverage did not increase. The overall decrease was -13.6% to 34.007%
noProblem No new tests were added and coverage has also reduced. Some UI testing could've been done.
noProblem They have mentioned that its UI change and has been discussed that testing isn't required in there documentation. But i think you should still have mentioned something there. Steps to follow to check how your changes work. 
noProblem Not required
noProblem Test cases were not required for this project.
noProblem The test cases were required as the chnages were related to UI. The team mentioned the same in the wiki.
noProblem yes, the ui operations works as intended.the features fixed now works as intended.
noProblem It's working.
noProblem Since the project was deployed hence manual testing could not be done but the screenshots show that the project works as intended.
noProblem The feature works as per the video shown.
noProblem Fro video it seems to work as intended.
noProblem The link to the deployed application was not available. So testing could not be performed.
noProblem the video explains the new functionality and the functionality is working as expected. Good job!
noProblem Yes, it works as expected.
noProblem Writeup has been improved after the first review. The codes now look more comprehensive.
noProblem Writeup is good and understandable. Test plan is written well indicating the steps clearly in what needs to be done to test.
noProblem The write was good and well-written. However, it would have been better if some screenshots were also present in the writeup. May be juxtaposing the screenshots of 'before and after' of fixing the issues. That would have made the write-up easier to understand.
noProblem The deployed link application again goes to video only, if deployment isn't done they could've removed the link.
noProblem Write up isn't good. They have just added there code in the write up without explaining anything. Plus no comments in code. Code snippets in writeup are going off the page.
noProblem The writeup is good and clearly explains the issues faced. However instead of putting in the code changed, I feel it would be better to have screenshots of git commit history where we can see both the previous code and new code to get a good idea of what actually was changed.
noProblem The write-up is well written and organised. Everything looks fine. The team should have mentioned about the approach taken to solve the mentioned problem statement which will make the implementation easier to understand. Also the team could have included few screen shots in the write-up.  
noProblem some improvements are required to deployed the code onto the production server. The code should included proper commenting so that if the future team picks up from this project, they could know what exactly the code is doing.
noProblem It might be good to move the long function to smaller functions. But the code looks clean and understandable.
noProblem In my opinion, the project is ready to be deployed and does not need to adopt a different approach.
noProblem The feature seems ok but it can't be deployed yet with all pending issues.
noProblem Since the code coverage has decreased and the video demonstrates a proper working
noProblem The deployed application was not available, so it cannot be accurately predicted if the code functions as intended. However the vedio links in the google drive show that the issues have been resolved through existing code. 
noProblem ll the checks are failing currently. The changes have a lot of robocop issues as well which should be fixed. Also the CI build is failing at the moment. Some of the tests are failing because of the change. 
noProblem Code looks fine, but build issue has to be fixed.
noProblem the build is still failing and there are issues which needs the team's attention. there is one warning and 1 error which needs to be fixed by the issue. according to the error, team should remove the debug code from the pull request.
noProblem Travis CI build is not passed. Though this was a bit common even for the second review, the 'codeclimate' issues are still showing.
noProblem No, the build did not pass in Travis CI. Several checks had failed but there was no conflict.
noProblem None of the tests - travis ci, code climate have passed
noProblem Everything is failing. Code climate has 56 issues. Build is failing. Haven't made a change since round 1.
noProblem The Travis test has failed and overall coverage has also decreased. There were many errors in the build log of travis.
noProblem All the checks including the CI build is failing.
noProblem Build is failing in Travis CI
noProblem The code is perfect right now.
noProblem Yes, through their commit record, I have seen some improvement.
noProblem Well written code.
noProblem Yes, there's new commits.
noProblem yes, new code committed during the second round.
noProblem Yes, according to the commit record, they have commit new code during the 2nd round.
noProblem Yes
noProblem The second commit is perfect. it got perfect coverage. But it seems that the 100% coverage was so since the first round. But the new commited code as better code style and no more indentation issue
noProblem 100 percent coverage.
noProblem Yes, they have added some test cases, and coverage increased.
noProblem 100 % coverage achieved. Great work!
noProblem The team did a great job in increasing the test coverage to 100%.
noProblem This is a testing project. The tests have covered all the scenarios possible.
noProblem Yes, it works as intended. 
noProblem The code coverage is 100%. Every test case passes after a manual check.
noProblem great writeup.
noProblem The document is well written with all the required details.
noProblem Yes, for production code itself is perfect.
noProblem As explained in the video, the build seems to work fine.
noProblem Yes, it passed all the pull requests.
noProblem The build successfully passes Travis CI.
noProblem The code seems to be good. It follows the principle of good design. Even though I do not know RUST, the use of variable names was very intuitive.
noProblem The code doesn't make sense to me, someone who isn't familiar with this project, but it does seem to be formatted well.
noProblem Some commits were made to rectify old errors and get an approved pull request
noProblem Yes, there is 
noProblem Yes there new commits in round 2.
noProblem Several new commits were added during the second round.
noProblem I don't see any tests added by this team, although they do mention that their code additions were not particularly testable except with the existing automatic tests, which they enabled.
noProblem This is not an Expertiza project.
noProblem To test the system operation the project has to be built and run. The Sample HTML file was used to render a Test Canvas as given in the Wiki
noProblem When tested the project does what was desired to be done.
noProblem This system doesn't have a UI I can view as it seems to be a browser add on.
noProblem Write up is good, with code flow diagram and test plan (pull request).
noProblem The Wiki is pretty much strong with plenty of info.
noProblem The write-up is lucid and has now incorporated the changes that were made in the round 2. It starts off by introducing Servo, Rust, OffScreenCanvas, web worker, Web IDL. The authors then describe the code flow using a flow chart which was really appealing. I especially liked the Under the hood section, which elucidated the files (OffscreenCanvas.webidl, OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2D.webidl, offscreencanvas.rs and offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs) that they modified/created in this project and their functionalities concisely. The write up then includes the code from the above four files and finally ends with the test plan with 2 approaches, links to pull request and references.
noProblem The write-up is good. I liked the use of the flow-chart to explain the flow of their code and explain the functionality. I think that this was the first write-up that used a flowchart.
noProblem The writeup is the best part about the project. It describes clearly what and how the work is done. One can clearly understand their working strategy from the writeup.
noProblem I'm unable to get a really good idea of exactly what was done here for this project other than that it can be used as a display and rendering port and that it improves fail-safeness of browsers.
noProblem The code implementation is correct , so with more edge test cases and after resolving the warnings in the travis test, the code would be production ready.
noProblem The code is well modularized and appropriate names are used for methods.  
noProblem The code is very well written and comments are properly given. Also the variables are descriptive and ruby guidelines are followed.
noProblem First review comment weren't addressed.
noProblem new code was comitted.
noProblem Few commits can be seen during 2nd phase. Mostly are for test plans.

noProblem The features work as intended and the emails are sent to the concerned party.
noProblem The write-up is good and it clearly explains what each portion of the changed code is intended for.
noProblem it is good starting place for future team to pickup.
noProblem The code is ready to be deployed onto the production server and in fact, the project was even partially merged.
noProblem No new test cases were added from the previous submit. Test cases already had full coverage so there was no need for additional testing. I was unsure how to answer this question as the rubric says any new test cases added.
noProblem All code is good, a variable name was even improved during the second round.
noProblem A small change was made, but there wasn't a need for drastic additions. 
noProblem All necessary code is passing the build.
noProblem The video makes it clear that the tests work and are covering all aspects necessary. 
noProblem The write up is still good.
noProblem The code is quite good.
noProblem The coverage was already at 100%, but they did update it to pass the build.
noProblem Yes. Variable name changes suggestion was incorporated.
noProblem Travis tests have failed. No conflicts. The overall test coverage has improved.
noProblem It is a testing project. The overall test coverage has improved. The tests thoroughly test the menu-bar and the sub-tress of menu bar(sub-menu options) as per the requirements.
noProblem No UI or functional changes are applicable. All the 29 tests run successfully
noProblem It is very well documented. No changes were required even during the first review.
noProblem It improves the test coverage, So once the Travis tests pass, It is ready to be merged with the Master branch. However no production deployment is applicable for test coverage improvement.
noProblem nicely written test cases

noProblem Not deployed
noProblem There is one new commit in round 2.
noProblem Yes the coverage is 100% already.
noProblem The code written follows the ruby on rails best practices.

noProblem Yes, the team has added plenty of tests. The test coverage increased to 100% whereas the overall coverage has increased by 11.4% 
noProblem Yes, the test covers all the scenarios, including testing values of variables in the menu node and null case scenarios.
noProblem The team has corrected a single bad name used in the tests. There has been no change done to DRY the code yet. there test as mentioned earlier has few segments repeated throughout each test. For ex, the instantiation of Menu object. There has been no comments added for the code yet.
noProblem Yes, there has been one commit in round 2, rectifying the bad name used
noProblem The code is well written, the way the list function was split into multiple modular functions is appreciable. A great amount of effort has gone into fixing the issues.
noProblem New code added is written well with DRY and no long or complicated functions. I could see file updated has changes on line such as tab and space. Team could work upon indentation. 
noProblem The code is well written. No issues with naming conventions or coding style.
noProblem The code is very well written and comments are properly given. Also the variables are descriptive and ruby guidelines are followed.
noProblem The code is clean.

noProblem No changes were committed in round 2.
noProblem Yes.
noProblem No new test cases are written.
noProblem Test Plan could be described better.
noProblem Team could have added test plan in wiki along with test covered and test description. Also could have worked upon increasing test coverage.
noProblem Test are written 
noProblem The team has added testcases but lacks coverage. The overall coverage decreased by 10.6% to 37.063%.
noProblem No test cases are added by the team and overall coverage of the project is decreased by 10.6%.
noProblem The operations work as intended but need to have automated test cases.
noProblem I could not get a deployment link or watch a video that demonstrates the work done. So, I'm unable to test.
noProblem I could neither test it manually nor there were any videos to check the functionality.
noProblem Write-up is explained pretty well.
noProblem I think the code need some amount of refactoring before it can be merged with the expertiza master and pushed to production. Some of the functions implemented by the team seem quite long and they should try and restrict the functionality implemented in each function to just one.
noProblem The code seems very well written and approach seems correct. If they improve the documentation and add test cases after thorough testing, it should be good to be deployed. As it stands, another team in future can pickup the code and implement these improvements.
noProblem Yes, the code has been written aptly and to the point. The intention is clear.
noProblem The Travis CI build has failed.
noProblem Pull request is not passed as well as Travis CI is also failed.

noProblem Yes, they did add the test cases and the coverage increased to 80%
noProblem coverage is same 
noProblem Yes, it increases the coverage too
noProblem Changes are covered with new test cases.
noProblem I followed the steps as mentioned in the wiki and it works as expected.
noProblem Yes Everything works perfectly fine.
noProblem Works properly
noProblem Yes, the UI changes according to the specified conditions. After logging in as a student, we can see the team name being displayed at the top of the page.
noProblem The features for the issues fixed work as intended.
noProblem Everything looks fine to me.
noProblem The writeup is great. I was able to understand the issue and do manual testing.
noProblem It was very well-written and self explanatory.
noProblem The wiki page has been written concisely. The team has used screenshots which ease the understanding of the work they've done. 
noProblem The write-up clearly explains the issues faced and the code fixes used to solve them.
noProblem Comprehensive.
noProblem Yes, the code changes are simple and to the point. I don't see any other way it could be done. 
noProblem The user name issue seems to not have been resolved when tested manually. The code may be deployable and would not cause a problem since there are not many complicated changes.

noProblem Yes, the Travis build is passing.
noProblem The code is well written and understandable. 
noProblem The code is well written and has proper functions to handle each action. Not too long functions and names are aptly defined
noProblem The code seemed to be well-written and properly commented. Comments made it very easy to understand the code.
noProblem Overall the code is written really well. Snake casing has been thoroughly followed and in case of JavaScript, the camel casing is followed.  No additional suggestions.
noProblem Yes, code has been committed in round 2.
noProblem Last commit was on Nov 6
noProblem Few commits made in 2nd round 
noProblem No link provided but the videos shows that everything is working well.
noProblem 2 Issues are resolved and when checked from UI, features are working as expected. Seems like no code refactoring is required. 
noProblem Manual testing could not be performed due to lack of project deployment. But, the screencasts show that everything works fine.
noProblem The UI seems to work as it should, at least from the writeup. 
noProblem The writeup is great and descriptive. I could find all the info I needed.
noProblem The writeup is very explanatory with all the screenshots attached which helps in better understanding
noProblem The write up is well written and explain the features that the team has implemented in a verbose manner.  The writeup mentions solution description which gives a walk through about what steps were taken to implement the functionality.  No suggestions.
noProblem The team has definitely resolved one issue. This could be a starting point for future teams.
noProblem Yes, the code is written aptly and to the point. I don't see any issues.
noProblem Yes just a few test plans needed and the code can be deployed on production server. 
noProblem This code can be deployed after solving the issues generated by Travis CI.
noProblem The approach seems to be correct and the writeup ready to be deployed.
noProblem This is a code and project that has been honed into perfection. The team has shown due diligence and taken care of long and complicated functions and somewhat shaky coding style from the last submission. They have refactored the code to perfection thus fulfilling all their objectives. 
noProblem The overall structure of the code looks good and all the coding standards have been followed. I feel like there could have been more comments to support the large amounts of changes that have been made.
noProblem The code follows the general guidelines for standard RSpec practices and also keeps the DRY principle in check. It makes a good use of names to specify what each attribute is assigned for.
noProblem No new commits were committed for the second round. It was cleaned up 13 days ago.
noProblem No new commits were made during the second round. The latest commit was on October 31st.
noProblem There was a substantial amount of commits done in the first phase of the project but I don't see any commits in the second phase. This could very possibly be because the team might have completed the requirement in the first phase itself.
noProblem Yes, an excellent job in that regard. They have first explained their test plans, then even provided links to their RSPEC tests which I checked. Then they have run and shown their screenshots of the Rspec tests going through successfully. 
noProblem According to the screenshots uploaded by the authors, the features work as they are supposed to. New questionnaires have been successfully created.
noProblem Yes, the code has been refactored to cover all the intended scenarios and the tests have been very well document along with testing the edge cases. As per their approach the first segregated the tests for questionnaires_controller into two test files, questionnaires_controller_spec and quiz_questionnaires_controller_spec and separated the tests for CRUD operations of quiz_questionnaires_controller into the quiz_questionnaires_controller_spec, renaming them from view_quiz, create_quiz and the like to view and create. This in my opinion is a thorough enough test. 
noProblem The system works as intended. The project required to make the features work such as removing hardcoded parameters as save_choice method, replacing switch statements with subclass methods and creating models for the subclasses. 
noProblem Extremely well written Wiki Page, thorough and to the point with enough technical content and relevant screenshots pertaining to the before and after scenarios of the problem statements. 
noProblem The writeup has been pretty well written by the team. Introduction to the problem statement, the implementation details, and the test plans have been stated.  
noProblem The writeup gives a gist of the work carried out by team throughout the project. The team added the Test Plan section describing the testing procedures carried out. It is also structured nicely allowing the reader to understand the project in it's entirety.
noProblem Surely, once the code is sufficiently tested by the TAs, then it is can surely be implemented as a change. Even so, the Travis CI and the overall Coverage should be verified first. Going by their page, it is a finished project and hence no use giving it to the next semester as a project. 
noProblem The code has been working fine, and once the integration conflict is solved, seems ready to be deployed. The future team will be able to pick up from where the current team has left.
noProblem There is significant improvement in the write up after the first round. It gives good idea of the project.
noProblem The code changes seem to be fine. I do not see any problems regarding the code as it is pretty well explained in the wiki as well.
noProblem Overall, the code was well written. As mentioned earlier, the only change the team had to make was add color codes. Hence, no mistake was made in the first round itself. Good Job.
noProblem Everything seems good.
noProblem CSS snippets are still written inline. No changes were made after round 1
noProblem Code looks good, there weren't many changes and mostly are HTML changes so no commenting is required as such as well. 
noProblem The code was very well written. However, that should be a given considering the complexity of the project which wasn't a whole lot.
noProblem Code is still using DRY principles
noProblem No new commits were made during round 2.
noProblem The last commit was made 9 days ago as per the given link. There were not many changes required, so seems fine.
noProblem I can not see any new commits in second submission as the functionality was working properly in first submission itself.
noProblem New commits were not added in the 2nd round. In my opinion they were not required as well as the team completed their task in the first round itself.
noProblem No new content was necessary during the second round.
noProblem No there were no new commits due to the fact that were no changes to be made
noProblem Yes
noProblem No new Commits
noProblem No test cases were added. No real scope for the test cases to be added to test changes made to HTML code.
noProblem The test cases are added with good explanation. It does increase the code coverage. The thing I liked that the screenshots itself speak for the test cases.
noProblem As mentioned in wiki page by team, color change does not affect button functionality, hence no test plan is required. Hence giving full points here.
noProblem Um, somehow your commits increase the overall coverage of the project (and as mentioned in the write-up, test cases aren't possible). 
noProblem It's UI project, testing isn't required as such. They have still mentioned in there documentation.
noProblem There are no test cases as it is an UI specific project
noProblem No tests were added as part of the project. just minimal UI changes
noProblem The code consists of small methods that mostly test one thing. This results in high readability. The team has made an extensive use of 'context' constructs which further enhance the code documentation. Moreover, the team has improved the .sort_by_name method making it cleaner and easier to follow. This was complemented by the fix of bad names that were present in the first round (e.g. stu1, p1 etc.). One suggestion pertaining to the '#scores' block would be to use specific assertions of fields instead of testing the object via inspect method and comparing it to the string value.
noProblem The code coverage is ~94% which passes the required threshold.
noProblem The writeup is comprehensive and fully covers given functionality. There were no significant issues that needed to be fixed from the first round. 
noProblem Code was cleaned up 5 days ago.
noProblem Code makes good use of rspec's describe and context options, and manages to achieve ~95% code coverage.
noProblem Coverage increased by 3%.

noProblem It is a testing project so test cases are added. The coverage has increased to 97.5 percent for Vm-Question Response Model.
noProblem Yes, the coverage has increased and test cases have been added. Coverage is more than 50%.
noProblem Coverage has increased from 11 to 97%. It is impressive. Great Job! The team has achieved what they were looking for.
noProblem The team added new test cases and make the coverage increase also the overall coverage for the whole system has increased
noProblem There wasn't any link provided to check if the UI was working fine. But there was a YouTube video showing the tests successfully running. And also the tests did seem to cover almost all the scenarios.
noProblem Yes almost all scenarios for vm_question_response model is covered. Good work.
noProblem This testing project covers all the scenario as required.
noProblem Since these are unit tests, no UI test needed.
noProblem The write-up explains what functionality is tested and why. The coverage is also mentioned along with code snippets which is good.
noProblem Writeup is well written and gives explanation for all the requirements.
noProblem The code is well written, the way the list function was split into multiple modular functions is appreciable. A great amount of effort has gone into fixing the issues.
noProblem Code is written very well, comments are detailed and functions and variables are named appropriately. (would just like to point out, in student_task_helper.rb#due_date_color , the variable "rtn" could've been named better!)
noProblem New code added is written well with DRY and no long or complicated functions. I could see file updated has changes on line such as tab and space. Team could work upon indentation. 
noProblem The code is well written. No issues with naming conventions or coding style.
noProblem The code is very well written and comments are properly given. Also the variables are descriptive and ruby guidelines are followed.
noProblem The code is clean.
noProblem The last commit is on 10/31.
noProblem Test are written 
noProblem the team has implemented there testing plan and have been very thorough with there test cases. They seem to have considered a lot of cases and have implemented them in rspec. The only thing that they should do is use different commits for adding test cases.
noProblem Well, the code looks good and very much follows the Ruby Style Guide. The code also is DRY. It looks well written and does not any changes.
noProblem It is given in wiki that most of your test cases depend on checking the output. However, like I mentioned in my last review, several test cases like the ones mentioned below can be automated. This is especially true as TDD is explicitly mentioned in your problem statement: "Write the required tests before implementing/refactoring the methods in the above-mentioned classes". Add past due assignments to the students task list (on Student View). Check for correction in due dates of assignments (when an assignments due date is edited, it should be appropriately moved from the Past assignments list to the Current Assignments list if needed) On Student Task page, separate the list of 'teamed with' students from the current tasks box.
noProblem Yes.
noProblem The code is both succinct and very carefully. i have not done the code check in the first round. but for this time, there's no bad names, functions are standardly-named, good alignment and commenting.
noProblem Project was on implementing test cases. The test cases are well written and the code coverage has increased.
noProblem The code is very well written and follows good coding practice
noProblem The code follows Ruby style guide.
noProblem Yes, it works as intended. It would be better if you could add a video recording of the flow/screenshots of the flow in the test plan. 
noProblem Yes, new code was committed in the 2nd round.
noProblem Yes code was committed to follow clean code practices based on first review.
noProblem Write-up is explained pretty well.
noProblem The wiki documentation has been updated. All the information has been documented in a neat and logical manner. The write up adequately provides what functionality the work is related to. They havent updated any part of the wiki documentation but overall their documentation is concise and to the point.
noProblem before deploying the project onto the production server, this projects asks  for some attention. new test cases should be added to the project. I can't say much on that.
noProblem Yes, the code has been written aptly and to the point. The intention is clear.
noProblem Test coverage remains the same at 94%. Hence, my suggestion/opinion is same as the previous review.

noProblem Yes, it is a good code.
noProblem Yes, the Travis CI build was passed. The conflicts could be seen resolved.
noProblem Yes, no conflict that's not resolved.
noProblem the code is very well written. there are no bad names, long functions or any lack of comments. The code written by the team is self-explanatory.
noProblem Code is short, variables and functions are well-named.
noProblem The code follows the DRY principles correctly
noProblem Yes, improved the code.
noProblem The code is concise and easy to understand. The team has provided comments to explain the logic of the new function created which really helps.
noProblem The code was well-written in the first round itself and followed good coding standards.
noProblem The code was already well-written . No changes were suggested in the first round. The team did a great work in following coding best practices. 
noProblem yes,  2 commits were made in round 2.
noProblem A few bug fixes were made after the first round of submissions
noProblem Yes, new commits were done.
noProblem yes
noProblem Yes. Twice during the second round.
noProblem There were only 2 commits made during the second round. However, the team had mostly implemented most of the functionality during the first round, maybe due to which there are less commits in the second round
noProblem There are no new commits during second round.
noProblem The team did change the project as there are 2 new commits. The CI build is still failing .
noProblem yes, the team had added 2 test cases and the coverage increase is there as well. Newly added tests are enough to cover the range of project.

noProblem The team has added test cases but the coverage did not increase by much
noProblem Coverage has increased.
noProblem Coverage increased by a good margin
noProblem No new test cases are written. From the previous review, The authors have converted all the cases discussed in Test Plan into automated tests. Overall coverage increased (+6.3%) to 43.07%
noProblem The team has added test cases and increased the test coverage.
noProblem The team has added new testcases in the new submission. The code coverage has also increased. Good work with the testcases.

noProblem The system works as intended.
noProblem The video explains the new functionality and the functionality is working as expected. all the scenarios are covered in the rspec test as well. Good job!
noProblem The write-up clearly mentions how to check/test the work done by the team. it includes almost everything the team has changed during their project.  It clearly mentions the filenames where the changes have been made. All the references are also included in the write-up  
noProblem Overall, it is well written.
noProblem The writeup has adequate screenshots to help understand the problem statement
noProblem Contains all the required explanation.
noProblem Very good. I go by what I said in the first review. It is very legible and I could understand what the project does and how the project does what it does.
noProblem yes, the code is ready to be deployed onto the server. this is a good starting place for future team to pick up.
noProblem Looks fine. My biggest concern however is, which student's view opens here?  Add the feature of impersonation to this, and we get two identical views of student_task/list page: one with this particular feature, and the other, with impersonation feature. What is the difference between these views
noProblem The code has mast elements ready but there can be more test cases generated with better test coverage. The code need not be rewritten from scratch, it just needs to include some more of the expected functionality
noProblem According to write-up and video yes but since I couldn't manually check I would say no.
noProblem the build fails and there is one warning and one error which needs to be fixed.
noProblem There were some build issues raised by Travis CI which have not been handled yet. However, there are no merge conflicts with the master branch.

noProblem Yes, as per the scope of the project, all works beautifully well. Great job team.
noProblem Works as intended.
noProblem Yes the color change is as per project. No new tests or re-factoring done as part of the project
noProblem The writeup is extremely well written. In the earlier round, I gave the team a suggestion to add the steps needed to check out their changes. They have added this part into the wiki now. Thank you and well done :)
noProblem Write up is written a neat and understandable with system screenshots and steps to test system manually.
noProblem The writing is good and completely covers the scope of the project.
noProblem Writeup is good. Explains everything they have done and how they have implemented.
noProblem No significant change from last round. But the writeup was good. Elaborative with screenshot of code and UI. It clearly mentioned the need for the change. But no approach mention but to be fair, the scope of the project doesnt call for it
noProblem Yes. The changes made are very basic and should not affect the functionality of the application in any away apart from the cosmetic changes made during the project.
noProblem Yes . Code seems ready to deploy. Also the approach taken is simple and very much acceptable.
noProblem I have no concerns regarding merging this into production.
noProblem Since, there are UI changes, they seem pretty improved
noProblem I believe the code is the best that it can ever be and should be merged with the expertiza.
noProblem The build request passed.
noProblem Well the build technically failed, but seeing as how that's practically impossible for this project, I'll give it a pass.
noProblem The build has passed and the changes are also well explained in the wiki. As expected, the screenshots of the test cases are also displayed.
noProblem The team has changed a model and a html page. But there are no new test cases attached to the changes.
noProblem Coverage increased by a good margin
noProblem No new test cases are written. From the previous review, The authors have converted all the cases discussed in Test Plan into automated tests. Overall coverage increased (+6.3%) to 43.07%
noProblem The coverage has increased by 6.3%. The team has added new tests that check whether Assignments is absent in the menu in default view and there is an option to Open Student View. The tests also check whether there is a close button present when the instructor is in the students view, also it checks whether the Assignment is present by default in the student view or not.
noProblem The team has added test cases and increased the test coverage.
noProblem The team has added new testcases in the new submission. The code coverage has also increased. Good work with the testcases.
noProblem Very good. I go by what I said in the first review. It is very legible and I could understand what the project does and how the project does what it does.

noProblem The last commit I see was 23 days ago, which seems that there wernt many changes done in the seond round. The wiki mentions the suggestions at the end, so it would have been good to have the code changes and tests for the same.
noProblem All the commits were completed by Oct 31
noProblem No commits were done in 2nd round.
noProblem the last commit I see is from Oct 31st.I'm assuming they did not have to change much in the 2nd round
noProblem No Commit,
noProblem A small amount of new code was committed in the second round.
noProblem No new commits were made during the second round.
noProblem No new commits have been made since the last round. However, there is nothing significant as just codeclimate fixes are remaining.
noProblem I couldn't any new  commits in the second submission, though the functionality seemed to be fulfilled in the first round itself.
noProblem Yes the team has added test cases.
noProblem Yes, the coverage has increased and has almost reached to 50%.
noProblem This project is refactoring and there were not much of functionality changes, I see that teams have changed the existing tests make sure there is no coverage miss
noProblem The test coverage seems to have increased slightly. Since this is a refactoring project, I wouldn't expect testing to be the focus, so that's pretty good even though the added test case most likely doesn't cover all the work done here.
noProblem The team had added a test case in the last round, which I think was sufficient to test basic functionality.  There have been no additions to test cases in the second round.
noProblem Team added several test cases, and the coverage was seen to increase
noProblem Yes the code addresses all issues.
noProblem Most of the functionalities that were required have been implemented but the final changes haven't been merged due to some build issues on Travis CI. The tests are quite comprehensive
noProblem Yes, refactoring did not impact on the existing operation at all.
noProblem The system operation works as intended.

noProblem overall it is well written, they can add reference section where they can put the link to the project etc.
noProblem The write-up is to the point and explains their approach neatly. The team has made efforts to update the write-up with the provided suggestions and it has improved the write-up.
noProblem The writeup was elaborate, and fully elucidated the test added and the removed methods and SQL lines and their scope. 
noProblem Yes  I think with additional testing it can be deployed.
noProblem I feel there are more number of test cases that need to be covered before deploying this in PROD.
noProblem I strongly believe that this code is ready for production server
noProblem Changes are working perfectly.
noProblem I think this code is ready to go, because it is better organized and structured than it used to be.
noProblem I think that it is a neatly written code and once the integration issues have been resolved, it should be ready to be deployed on th production server.  The code being readable, can be easily picked up by the future team.
noProblem Travis CI test has been failed on Github.
noProblem build is passing on Travis CI. there are no pending conflicts
noProblem Few issues with the build but I feel they are trivial.
noProblem The pull request did not pass the automatic build requirements. It seems as though this team worked very hard to try to fix the build errors.

noProblem Don't see any DRY issues. Well Written Test code
noProblem The code is well written.  No suggestions.
noProblem No there had been no bad names or wrong conventions used even in round 1. so no change there. The team has made few modifications to beautify the code by using ternary conditions which did make the code elegant. No new comments added.
noProblem Commits for Code Climate changes were pushed in.
noProblem The team added new commits in the second round as well to improve their code style, improve codeclimate issues and changes other reviewer's suggested. Very few teams have done this. Great work.
noProblem Several commits were made to decrease the code climate warnings.
noProblem Yes. They are updating code to fix code climate issues.
noProblem Yes, there are new codes committed during the 2nd round.
noProblem Yes commits are done to fix the code climate issues.

noProblem The tests are good and it can be merged to the main line.
noProblem Did not find problems in the code in the first round. Follows ruby style guide, commented and good naming. Very well written.
noProblem The last commit was 21 days ago, so I fear that that there are no commits being made in round 2. Could have done a commit in round two just to confirm that there were no changes required in round 2, so that the reviewer may be certain about it.
noProblem I don't see any new commits for round 2, mostly nothing was needed
noProblem No new commits.
noProblem The team has added test cases: 1. To check that if there is no rejoinder for the review then it redirects to new author feedback page. 2. To check that the other teammate is able to edit. 3. To check if the page is redirecting back to review. 4. To check if the rejoinder by a participant of a team is saved properly.  The overall coverage decreased from 48% to 47.601%. It decreased by 0.04%
noProblem The coverage has decreased by 0.04%. The team has added some tests which were not present in the initial submission. 44.9% of the changed lines are covered
noProblem Everything is working
noProblem The team has not provided steps for manual testing even though this was requested during round 1 review.

noProblem There is no new commit during the 2nd round.
noProblem No need for adding new test cases as the previous submission already achieved 100% coverage. I apologize for not being certain how to accurately answer this question.
noProblem They didn't add test cases, but the test coverage is always above 90%.

noProblem The writeup is well written and clearly tells the flow and method of working. It shows clearly what all work is done and how it is done. It mentions specifically the explanation of each functionality and how it is checked.
noProblem As mentioned above, they can make it better by fixing some issues.
noProblem The project is almost on the stage that it can be deployed on the production server. However, there are few test cases that are failing as shown on the git. If these minor flaws are fixed then the code is good to go.

noProblem The write up clearly captures the functionality that the work is related to.
noProblem well written document my suggestion is put the cropped version of images or even links to images is also fine. 
noProblem The write up is well written and self explanatory.  It would have been better if the screenshots were of standard size but that is not a problem since the purpose of the document is just to explain the project.
noProblem The authors have documented the steps they did to solve the issues in a clean manner. Although they haven't mentioned any particular design principles or design thinking that went on in solving the issues. They have explained all the functionalities of each file they have modified and stated why they have modified the particular file. One thing they could have added were class diagrams and dependency maps. Or some pictorial representation of the flow of each task which will help the reviewers and instructors to quickly catch up on their idea. It doesn't seem like the authors have updated their writeups since the last submission.
noProblem Very well written and elaborated.
noProblem The write-up is well written and organised. Everything looks fine. Great work with the write up!  
noProblem The write-up has been improvised by the authors and they have added the reasoning for the approach they chose. This increases the understanding of their solution.  They have also modified their test plan steps.
noProblem Since the code coverage has decreased, I don't think this code should be deployed on production. However, it is a good starting place for a new team to pickup.
noProblem this code is ready for server
noProblem Yes, I think the project is ready to be deployed at the production server since all the required functionalities are implemented.
noProblem I think the authors have done a good job in fixing the issues but they should have added tests to check if their code does handle all the possible edge cases and does not break any other code functionalities. I think this is a good starting place for a future team to pick up this project and implement some testing specs regarding the functionalities that the authors have fixed.
noProblem Yes, I believe this code is ready to be deployed as it seems perfeclty fin  
noProblem The link to the deployed application was not available, so the project could not be tested.

noProblem It was unit tests code.
noProblem Rspec code looks good. Descriptive context and it statements and good variable name usage. Very good work overall.
noProblem The coding style is good. The test cases have been written properly. Also I have seen from the code that the team has covered different cases and not stuck to the common one.
noProblem There were no commits in second round, but this is due to the fact that they achieved a 100% coverage in round 1 itself.
noProblem Nope, but they already did pretty well.
noProblem There were quite a few commits in the second round. The team worked hard to improve the existing test cases as well as add new ones. Even the mentor Zhewei approved of their work.
noProblem The last commit was on October 30. However, the team had already achieved 100% test coverage.
noProblem I can see no latest commits . The last commit was on 31st October.
noProblem Project was already completed in round 1
noProblem yes
noProblem The coverage is 100% already.
noProblem 100% coverage by the tests.
noProblem For a testing project, increasing the coverage is important. Doesnt seem like the coverage was increased to a good extant. 
noProblem Yes the team had added the test cases and this did increase the coverage of the corresponding model file.
noProblem The team has not added any test cases but they had already achieved 100% test coverage in the first round.
noProblem Yes the team has added test cases. The coverage is however only 48%. 
noProblem improved

noProblem They did unit tests
noProblem As stated above the tests cover most of the scenarios.
noProblem yes, the test covers all the scenarios. 
noProblem cover all

noProblem Extremely well-written and verbose. 
noProblem Very detailed
noProblem The documentation is detailed covering all the test cases.
noProblem The doc is very descriptive and well written. Good job!
noProblem I would describe the write as being: 1. Very meaningful. 2. Concise. 3. Precise Te authors do explain the assignment.rb file as well as their test plan in veryyyy much a detailed way.
noProblem The writeup has a brief explanation on the role of the AssignmentTeam in the expertiza project. They have given the details on the test plan and test cases. I think it is a good writeup.
noProblem The writeup is perfectly written clearly indicating the work done. It nicely shows how the work was done and what approach as followed.
noProblem There are no errors in the build, the Travis CI build has passed and 100% coverage. You are good to go! :)
noProblem The code is easy to read. As one places the model file along side the test code, it very much makes sense as to why they wrote each line.
noProblem The team has successfully managed to pass all test cases with 100% test coverage.
noProblem Good job done here! You are the only team among the ones I reviewed for whom the Travis build has passed.
noProblem All passed.

noProblem All checks have passed without any conflicts. Well done!
noProblem passed
noProblem No New Commits
noProblem The pull request was not updated. (In fact, I can't see any of the changes in the linked repo.)
noProblem Nope, the last commit still shows from 12 days ago which is the time period even before the first submission. Overall, the branch is 3 commits ahead and 20 commits behind the Expertiza master. Even so, conclusively going by their git hub their last commit was before the first submission and hence, no commits in the second submission.
noProblem The commits were done before the first deadline but unfortunately I don't see any commits during the second round or the pull request might not have been updated.
noProblem No new commits after the first submission.
noProblem No new Test cases
noProblem I don't think that writing the test cases was in the scope of this project. Three files were changes overall, which two were .rb files and one was db file.
noProblem The team has changed a model and a html page. But there are no new test cases attached to the changes.
noProblem Works
noProblem As said above no visible testing scenarios have been implemented or even covered in their doc that they have given. Moreover, no changes have even been made since the last submission. So, answer to all the above questions is no. 
noProblem The writeup is good; I can clearly understand the problems and the fixes.
noProblem The write-up is very well written and documented. It is aided well with the the help of screenshots and proper labelling. The only small thing that I would like to suggest is the steps to reproduce or something similar so that the person not familiar with the expertiza can also reach to the desired place.
noProblem Yeah, the build has passed the Travis CI test and there were no conflicts found on the pull request.
noProblem The Travis CI has passed.
noProblem Yeah the UI and everything else looks as it is supposed to and the functionalities work as well.
noProblem Code looks good. Well formatted and naming conventions are followed. 
noProblem The code was well written and implemented the functionalities needed. It made good use of naming conventions and the team worked on improving the code layout by following the Ruby style guide and DRY principles.
noProblem Overall the write up was not bad. Here were some of the things I believe that could be improved: Problem Statement;Seems to be wrong. I believe it should be included in the background as it merely describes the files that they are supposed to work on.
noProblem Travis tests have passed. There were some initial failures but the team has fixed it. There are no lingering failures.
noProblem The code passes for the Travis build as well as Danger Bot. However, it fails for code climate with 3 issues yet to be fixed. In totality, the pull request does satisfy the need to pass the required builds.
noProblem the build passes
noProblem The overall structure of the code looks good and all the coding standards have been followed. I feel like there could have been more comments to support the large amounts of changes that have been made.
noProblem The project follows most of the DRY principles
noProblem Yes the code has been well written and very ruby like. The usage of existing gems is good. Functions have were good. I did not find many issues with the first review. So authors have kept it the same. very well done.  I wanted few more comment in code but thats okay. 
noProblem no new commits.
noProblem No the new code was not committed during the second round. This could be due to the fact that the team finished their code at the end of the first round itself.
noProblem The team has not made any new commits in round 2 because they did the code implementation in round 1.
noProblem The last commit was made on Oct 31
noProblem No new code or improvements have been done in round 2. Only documentation has been edited. The code could have been improved a little after the suggestions were given.
noProblem No new code was necessary.
noProblem No new commits in 2nd phase
noProblem No new commits during the second round.
noProblem test cases were added to increase the coverage.
noProblem The team has added 2 test cases in the sidekiq_mail_worker_spec. More test cases could be added to fully test the functionality. 
noProblem Coverage is present, slightly increases the overall project coverage.
noProblem Yes the team added the test cases. 45/69 new lines have been covered in the  tests. good work. but I feel that they could have added additional -ve test cases. 
noProblem Yes everything does seem to work properly. Since this was a refactoring project every feature worked as it was supposed to.
noProblem Features work as expected.
noProblem This project is based on emails which cannot be tested in test environment.
noProblem The team has implemented most of the required functionalities
noProblem The features work as they are supposed to, only problem is with the code using excessive if-else like structure. Code is brittle in this sense. Could have made functions and passed parameters to make it more flexible.
noProblem Functionality seems correct.
noProblem yes 
noProblem The refactored mailer with the use of Sidekiq works as intended.
noProblem The writeup has been pretty well written by the team. Introduction to the problem statement, the implementation details, and the test plans have been stated.  
noProblem The write up addresses details of all the three problem statements along with the code changes done in every file and the files added. The team has also added screenshots of the manual testing.
noProblem The writeup is comprehensive and includes code that was added so it is easy to understand.
noProblem Lots of improvement over the last phase. Many recommendations have been implemented. The write up is well formed and structured. The entire flow is explained along with files changed/methods implemented in each stage. Some formatting issues so -1
noProblem The test section has been improved with more detail.
noProblem authors have added a new doc in addition to wiki. i think that is not required, they could have simply added that in the wiki.  as in review 1 would have liked a. link to the issue in problem statement  2.  more details in why this sidekiq was used and not other message queue
noProblem Write up is elaborate, and elucidates the test cases and tests well.
noProblem The code is ready to be deployed in my opinion to the production server. The team could improve the quality of their code by visiting the code climate tests.
noProblem code can be deployed on production server as necessary test cases and implementation has been carried out succesfully.
noProblem The code implementation is correct , so with more edge test cases and after resolving the warnings in the travis test, the code would be production ready.
noProblem The code is written well but there are some small build issues as pointed out by Travis CI which need to be rectified for it to be deployed
noProblem Code is ready to be deployed in production if it is refactored and broken down into smaller chunks. Maintenance might me tough on this one. Functionality wise, works great!
noProblem There's a lot of changes made to the project to incorporate Sidekiq, but assuming that's fine, the project is ready for merge.
noProblem The code has been merged in a good way and there have been no merge conflicts. The build did pass the Travis CI. The code climate test failed but those were small issues which can easily fixed by just revisiting the code. Also the team have added a debug code which will need to be removed.
noProblem The build has passed and has no conflicts with the base branch.
noProblem Travis CI runs smoothly and no errors occurred. No conflicts occurred.
noProblem Everything checks out.
noProblem yes build passed but there are many code climate warnings that can be easily cleaned up such as tips for refactoring and unassigned variables. A more careful look at the tool warnings was required.
noProblem Code build passed the Travis CI build with some warnings thrown by the other tests.
noProblem Yes, improved the code.
noProblem yes,  2 commits were made in round 2.
noProblem Yes, new commits were done.
noProblem yes
noProblem Yes. Twice during the second round.
noProblem Coverage has increased.
noProblem Works as intended. Features work as they are supposed to. Tests cover all scenarios.  
noProblem The system works perfectly as intended.
noProblem The system works as intended.
noProblem The video explains the new functionality and the functionality is working as expected. all the scenarios are covered in the rspec test as well. Good job!
noProblem The writeup has adequate screenshots to help understand the problem statement
noProblem Overall, it is well written.
noProblem Contains all the required explanation.
noProblem The code is well written, the way the list function was split into multiple modular functions is appreciable. A great amount of effort has gone into fixing the issues.
noProblem Code is written very well, comments are detailed and functions and variables are named appropriately. (would just like to point out, in student_task_helper.rb#due_date_color , the variable "rtn" could've been named better!)
noProblem The code is well written. No issues with naming conventions or coding style.
noProblem The code is very well written and comments are properly given. Also the variables are descriptive and ruby guidelines are followed.
noProblem The code is clean.
noProblem Test are written 
noProblem Yes.
noProblem Write-up is explained pretty well.
noProblem Yes, the code has been written aptly and to the point. The intention is clear.
noProblem Codewise no issues. Build issue has to be fixed.
noProblem The code seems very well written and approach seems correct. If they improve the documentation and add test cases after thorough testing, it should be good to be deployed. As it stands, another team in future can pickup the code and implement these improvements.
noProblem Code is well written, DRY.
noProblem The names and the structures of the functions are all used properly. Besides, the team gave comments on the codes, which makes it is easier to understand.
noProblem The document is well written in properly segmented sections.
noProblem Very well written doc with all the necessary details.
noProblem The plan is very well documented. I see a lot of brain storming happening
noProblem The team's design includes all the models required for incorporating the functionalities. The have depicted a high level design in diagram as well. 
noProblem The design section of the writeup gives a very high level view of the design the team has planned to implement. So, not much can be deduced until the teams drills down further regarding the same.
noProblem The design plan seems to encompass everything required by the project.
noProblem yes it does 
noProblem Yes, they have everything that a good doc requires except the empty sections of implementation, design and testing. These in my opinion should be a part of a very important focus.   
noProblem Yes, the team seems to have incorporated all the functionality needed.  
noProblem the team did a great work in understanding the requirements and have included the design for all the requirement mentioned in the requirement document.
noProblem Yes they talk about all the functionality to be implemented
noProblem The authors has discussed the functionality implementation in detail. It justifies the approach they would be using.
noProblem The explaiantions were the best part of the writeup. The author has kept in mind that the reviewer might not be familiar with the basics of expertiza, and hence gives a very lucid explaianation.
noProblem The proposed changes look good.
noProblem team suggested that usage of decorator pattern is the key solution to the improvement, also approach on DRYness will be handled later
noProblem Explanations are given adequately. 
noProblem I liked the idea of putting the important files for reference. This is extremely useful and makes it really easy to understand what is being done.
noProblem the team has explained the implementation design/strategy in detail. the design was explained with all the required details and was very easy to understand.
noProblem Amazing documentation with diagrams and proper explanation!
noProblem The design proposed by the author of reusing LotteryController just like in topic bidding seems reasonable to address the bidding implementation in peer review.
noProblem i feel new design will not add any additional overhead in response
noProblem Good application workflow and analysis. Appears to be sound.
noProblem The authors are aware of the principles and are yet to figure out a way to reuse the methods to implement the functionalities. No new methods were proposed in the documentation. The idea of implementation looks fine and the new design seems seems to follow the already written code structure and design patterns. The design doesn't pose any threat to time complexity.
noProblem Not much has been talked about the methods or classes the changes will be done to. But they are clear with their job.  
noProblem Diagrams on peer review assignment have been included in the design by the team.
noProblem The current umls are great. Make sure to include more of these visual aids in the implementation section of your document. It will be a wonderful writeup.
noProblem Excellent use of class diagrams!
noProblem design doc has diagram explanation for working process 
noProblem Proper visual aids and UML like diagrams are provided in the document for better understanding of the implementation
noProblem well represented.
noProblem The design document is well done with proper visual aids and explains the problem being tackled and the proposed solution very well.
noProblem Yes. Very easy to follow just by looking once!
noProblem The design doc looks complete with all of the necessary details being covered.
noProblem  They showed all the details which were asked for
noProblem Brilliantly written code document consisting of background, problem statement and the implementation plan. 
noProblem The authors have dine a good job of detailing the issues at hand and their proposed solution. UML diagrams like a flowchart could have been used to further clarify the working of the proposed design.
noProblem The design incorporates all the functionalities that needs to be implemented. No suggestions are required.   
noProblem The suggested fix would address all the functionalities which is required to be implemented for the problem statement.
noProblem  Yes the design include all the required functionalities as their design plan. the problem statement specifies 3 task one is related to the admin panel , and two are related to the instructor panel . in their plan they have specified their approach and which all files need modification
noProblem The document outlines all the required functionalities along with the design and implementation plan stated   
noProblem All the requirements have been covered
noProblem Yes, most of the functionality are included. Besides, they also got detailed explanations.
noProblem Yes. It incorporates all the functionality required by this project.
noProblem Yes the design doc covers all of the required functionalities.
noProblem It seems that the design incorporates all of the necessary functionality. It also mentions details of how the team is going to implement said functionality.
noProblem  Some more specific details could be added
noProblem Yes, functionalities mentioned are covered in the doc
noProblem Yes, it covers everything.
noProblem Yes.
noProblem Yes, the authors have a great job of including all the needed functionality. 
noProblem The team has provided enough explanation about how they are going to work on this project. Overall quality of explanation is good.  Suggestion: Include the purpose of implementing these functions/changes.
noProblem The team has proposed reasonable changes to address the problem statement in detail. The explanation justifies every change they have suggested.
noProblem  The changes that the author has proposed is quite inclined with the task that are expected to be completed. the author explains the the changes properly by mentioning the files that needs to updated along with the screenshots of the flow.
noProblem The explanation is clear to follow but it could also include some more of the abstract design like UML diagrams, explanation of the use cases etc. 
noProblem Looks like the team spent some time looking at the code and coming up with the solution. Good Job
noProblem Their explanation is adequate and easy to understand.
noProblem The authors have given adequate explanation in terms of the following what is existing currently, what needs to be changed. The have also explained with a diagram the exact place where they would be adding elements to the UI. Also the files required to be changed are also mentioned. 
noProblem  The suggested changes seem to be appropriate. Explanation was also easy to follow.
noProblem The overall quality of explanations is very detailed and good. I might even take few ideas from here to improve my own design doc.
noProblem  They have explained adequately
noProblem Yes very well done in explanation of changes and what needs to be done. Screen shots are helpful. good work 
noProblem Comprehensive.
noProblem Detailed implementation plan provided, including which files they expect to change and what the output should look like
noProblem The authors have done a pretty good job with explaining the proposed design. They have used wire frames to show us exactly where the changes are to be made. Adding a flow chart would make things much clearer.
noProblem The design seems to be precise. The description of the changes are provided in detail. Team has clearly mentioned about the approach that they will use. Enough efforts have been taken by the team to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it. 
noProblem  As the project is more of adding features to the user interface of the website , the design plan is covering all the necessary steps that needs to be implemented
noProblem The code design appears to be sound. The UI implementation as shown on the screenshot looks intuitive. However, the final implementation is necessary to say definitively that the code is not smelly 
noProblem Design is good, there might be some changes when they start implementing it but its a good starting point.
noProblem The design appear to be good. Specific gems are also mentioned eg: paginate that would divide the document into discrete pages.
noProblem The design changes as described seem sound.
noProblem I don't see any trace of smells or redundancy in the proposed solution.
noProblem The design seems to be sound. I would like more details on the database of the Bacui projects seeing as most of us don't know what they look like given that most of us have worked on Expertiza projects. So, a short description of the different tables the project is going to interact with along with any and all modifications would really help understand IF there will be any possibility that the design would turn out to be non-DRY or smelly.I think the team is good on what gems are to be used.
noProblem No potential smells or problems found.
noProblem Screenshot explains the functionality of project very well.It is really easier to understand how the end product will look like. Suggestion: the team should include a flowchart depicting the flow of the functionality. 
noProblem They have added a screenshot for each of the problem they plan to tackle.
noProblem They show their design page as their visual aids, and their are helpful for readers to understand what their designs look like.
noProblem UML diagrams are not mentioned but since these are UI changes, the changes are sufficiently explained with the help of representation of UI in terms of images.
noProblem The whole document is easy to understand and well-written. Suggestion: It would be better to include what tools and technologies would be used in the project.
noProblem There were ample of visual aids to explain and walk through the proposed solution. I liked it.
noProblem Good that you have used screenshots to explain the approach. Include Use case and activity/flow diagrams also.
noProblem UI enhancements are provided here.
noProblem They authors have used visual aids to their benefit. Even though they could have added a flow diagram, the wire frames and other screenshots they have used serve the purpose and add to the clarity of the explanation.
noProblem  This was excellently specific and succinct. Very nice work
noProblem  Its fine. I have the gist of it, but most of the text in the document is cut and pasted from the Project Description. The uml is a nice touch, albeit super bare.
noProblem Well structured i think everything is covered
noProblem The document explains well how the team is planning to approach the refactoring.
noProblem The team has incorporated all of the functionality required for segregation including the exact reports and functions to be removed out of review_mapping_controller.rb along with the design pattern to be followed(strategy  in this case).
noProblem  In a way, yes, because it copied the project description, and illuminated which models they wanted to create in the refactor.
noProblem  The design document includes all the functionality the team is hoping to achieve. they have explained clearly what they plan to work and modify.
noProblem It has most of the functional features available.
noProblem  As the project is on refactoring, not many functionalities to considered. Given the problem statement, it clearly indicates the design should be able to incorporate the requested changes
noProblem Yes, the design incorporates all of the functionality required.
noProblem All the functionality is given for review_mapping_controller.rb along with the design pattern. 
noProblem The explanation is easy to follow. I am able to get a complete idea of what changes the team intend to make.
noProblem Expectations look attainable. The changes proposed are concise and crisp. Team should be able to do a good job with this implementation.
noProblem  Again, its fine. I don't understand the changes too well, but I also don't understand MVC and Expertiza very well either, but maybe they could have tried harder. I do feel there is a strong need to refactor and improve the code quality of Expertiza.
noProblem The explanation is decent and comprehensible 
noProblem I don't see any of the above mentioned problems happening since the design matches perfectly with the objective. The topic itself is to move unnecessary code out of review_mapping_controller and hence according to the design the code will actually become cleaner and better.
noProblem The proposed design seems reasonable. Before proceeding with the project, team should also look at other references to those functions and do it accordingly.
noProblem The implementation planned by the team seems to follow all ruby on rails guidelines and does seem to follow the DRY principle.  
noProblem No problem I could observe 
noProblem The UML class diagram helps to understand the reports involved, their attributes and functionalities. It provides a general overview about the interrelation of the seven different reports.
noProblem The authors provide a UML diagram to explain the relationship between the classes and a screenshot to show where they are going to add a button, which are really helpful.
noProblem  This was excellently specific and succinct. Very nice work
noProblem Well structured i think everything is covered
noProblem The team has incorporated all of the functionality required for segregation including the exact reports and functions to be removed out of review_mapping_controller.rb along with the design pattern to be followed(strategy  in this case).

noProblem I don't see any of the above mentioned problems happening since the design matches perfectly with the objective. The topic itself is to move unnecessary code out of review_mapping_controller and hence according to the design the code will actually become cleaner and better.
noProblem  Not enough implementation description to provide adequate feedback on this question.
noProblem The implementation planned by the team seems to follow all ruby on rails guidelines and does seem to follow the DRY principle.  
noProblem The design proposed by the team specifies an addition of a new button to the buttons tray from the existing UI. The button when clicked must bring a menu of additional reports. This functionality should consider the mapping to the review_mapping controller file that will implement the given features.
noProblem No problem I could observe 
noProblem The team has done a good job with the UML diagram. However, in my opinion, it would be better if they can add details for all the classes in the diagram.
noProblem The UML diagram shows the various subclasses clearly. It would have been better if it had also explained a few attributes/ methods.
noProblem The UML diagram is having the correct contents but needs the rough names of class methods
noProblem The UML class diagram helps to understand the reports involved, their attributes and functionalities. It provides a general overview about the interrelation of the seven different reports.
noProblem The authors provide a UML diagram to explain the relationship between the classes and a screenshot to show where they are going to add a button, which are really helpful.
noProblem A brief description for the class level implementation would be better.
noProblem Everything has been described well and in details.
noProblem at current state, the design doc has project problem, project solution, and design diagram, and each section has detailed description of the project.
noProblem The document is well structured and provides all required information. 
noProblem The document explains what was asked for
noProblem Yes everything is incorporated.
noProblem All functions required are stated in the design document, which include search for user, assignment, questionnaire, and reviews.
noProblem Yes.
noProblem Yes, they've included all functionalities.
noProblem The design document covers all the possible cases and should be fine.
noProblem Yes it does. They have explained the propose solution as well for each issue.
noProblem The design incorporates all the basic functionality.
noProblem Yes, almost all types of search functionalities are covered.
noProblem The design implements all the defined functionality elaborately.
noProblem Yes, the design incorporates all of the functionality required and also gives the possible solutions.
noProblem The quality of explanation is good and adequate.
noProblem The proposed search features are good. If all of them are implemented it should more than suffice.
noProblem The changes proposed are good and clearly meet the objectives of the project.
noProblem Good explanations. Easy to follow.
noProblem Overall, the design proposed seems good.
noProblem Yes, the changes are completely feasible
noProblem The authors have added the methods in the right classes. The new design is properly refactored and the gems are relevantly used. The new design might potentially increase the response time of the system because of advanced search option.
noProblem Yes they have provided an UML diagram which follows convention and explains their approach
noProblem The team has added sufficient diagrams for the reader
noProblem The diagrams are succinct and well-understood.
noProblem The ER Diagram is very well done. It encompasses all the classes and their attributes. Also the use of different shapes like diamond, square etc is great. 
noProblem Not required for this project
noProblem The E-R diagram seems to deliver the task
noProblem There is an ER diagram which defines the relationships in the system.
noProblem Wrtie up clearly explains the project purpose, what changes needs to be made, however including a mock test plan would have been better.
noProblem Most of parts are included, but they should include more details in their doc.
noProblem Design document has all the necessary information like project design, test plan. The team has gone through their topic deeply and can be seen by their illustration of their implementation. Also, they have included code snippets which show thoroughness of their approach 
noProblem The design doc contains project purpose, project design and testing plan in the wiki. The wiki contains mock visualizations which make it easy to understand the project proposal and how are they planning to do. The design flow as a flow chart adds to the ease of understanding. The test plan explains about the technologies that they are planning to use for testing. Suggestion:  The test plan could say what should be done in testing than just the technologies to be used for a particular part of code. For ed, we plan to have a dummy small data and see if the graphs output the visualizations correctly, if the sum id being counted to 100% of the class participation etc... the stacked version could also have been represented for better understanding.
noProblem The document shows the flow of work really well.However, I would like to suggest to put more of test planning and the tools and technologies that will be used. This will enhance the quality of the document to a great extent.
noProblem The design doc is good and provides a clear picture about the objective of the project. However,It would also be nice to know what features would be tested in the test plan.
noProblem All necessary sections are present.
noProblem Yes the design incorporates all of the functionalities
noProblem Incorporates intended functionality.
noProblem Yes, their design has all of the functionality that are required.
noProblem The design document has included all the functionality that is required by the project description.
noProblem Yes
noProblem The design incorporates and clearly explains flow of diagram for class performance, but not much is included for Integration of review performance. suggestion : The topic of Integration of review performance can be talked about in brief .
noProblem The design has a good design flow diagram which is clear and concise.
noProblem The design follows the basic functionality expected by proposing a bar graph solution for the select criteria. It could incorporate the rubrics that the team are planning to target. The flow in general does help to understand the project.
noProblem The design document incorporated all the functionalities that the project is supposed to be implementing.  No suggestions. 
noProblem Yes
noProblem The explanation is quite well documented such as including the flow chart , kind of bar graphs they would prefer and the files that they will update. Adding of screenshots of the flow of the website would make it more easy to understand for a leyman.
noProblem Changes suggested look good.
noProblem The overall quality of the explanations are good, but they should include more details about their design, which may not be easy to understand.
noProblem the team has mentioned all the files that will be changed and have also written a paragraph stating what are the proposed changes. The team could also document the changes that are being made to individual code files stating the changes done using code snippets and the reason why the changes are being made. Also they can talk about what design patterns principle are being used to incorporate the functionality that is being proposed. The team could also use CRC cards to depict the proposed code changes. This will not only help readers understand the report better but also help the team in dividing work between the team members and fast tracking the completion of project.
noProblem The changes proposed for the Class performance is adequate and explains the files to be changed, what changes from the controller perspective and views perspective. no particular suggestions proposed
noProblem The team proposed to add a bar graph to give a pictorial view of the scores and indicate the performance of students.
noProblem The changes proposed by the team include implementing a bar chart, stacked or single. Based upon the project description, it is advised that the team look for other alternatives like pie chart that would help to span the results with a minimal look.       
noProblem A simple enough explanation has been provided for the functionality.  No suggestions.
noProblem For Now the design proposed looks perfect.
noProblem Design flow looks good.
noProblem The authors seem to have studied the code well and have thought of a good plan to implement the project. They also seem to follow DRY principles while adding and changing code. Also the new design flow is quite simple and easy to understand which can be implemented without any high degree of convoluted code.
noProblem The design changes as described are sound, they are mostly on Javascript for the visualization and dont potentially make the code "smelly"
noProblem The team has given a design flow that underlines the basic way in which they are planning to target the issue at hand. It can make use by giving an example as to how the output might look and the document must also describe the tools that would be used for achieving the task.
noProblem The design looks good enough. It mostly deals with html.erb files to accommodate the graph and some database filtering in the controllers.I do not think that the design will increase the responses time of the system. Suggestion: If the details regarding how the graph will be implemented or any gem will be used should have been given. I did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality. That too would have been useful. 
noProblem The UML diagram included here is a flow chart diagram , which explains the process of how the instructor will be able to see the visualization and is easy to understand the flow
noProblem Design flow diagram is included indicating the flow which is good.
noProblem The UML diagrams is great, which is clear and easy to understand.
noProblem The have included a detailed design flow representation and have also included the visualizations. The could have added Lo-Fi UI cards to depict changes to views which will help them visualize the changes and also help instructors in suggesting improvements at an early stage which will help reduce unnecessary code changes in latter stages of the project.
noProblem The team has attached a bar chart for visualization which helps in understanding their purpose. Suggestion : More visual aids could have been added. The stacked bar chart as mentioned earlier . More mockups could have been added.
noProblem The design diagram is good and it would also be helpful to have a few screenshots of the current expertiza view.
noProblem The team has provided a flow diagram that helps to infer the structural outline of the project. The scope of the project can be perceived from the diagram.
noProblem A flowchart and graph has been shown in the documentation.  Suggestions: I feel that there should have been mockups of the screens where the functionality will actually appear. Team should have shown how the solution would look like on the expertiza page. There could have been use case diagrams too. 
noProblem Two graphs provided provide a good understanding of the process and what expected visualization should be. More diagrams would have been helpful.
noProblem Design document looks complete with problem statement, files that needs to be modified, a Lo-Fi diagram to indicate the flow.
noProblem Clear understanding of what needs to be done
noProblem This is a very innovative idea. Well explained design document. Files needed to be changes are also mentioned.
noProblem The design docs looks complete with all of the details being covered.
noProblem Yes it states the plan, design well. Testing can be better represented in terms of whether its UI testing or Automated tests etc.
noProblem The design document is well done with proper visual aids and explains the problem being tackled and the proposed solution very well.
noProblem The document is well written Just that a UML diagram or something similar could have been included to make it clearer and easier for the reader to understand.
noProblem Good work on problem statement and implementation ideas. However, screenshots could have added. LoFi sketches and flowcharts missing. 
noProblem The design doc is well designed and complete.
noProblem The design doc looks complete with all of the necessary details being covered.
noProblem Completed both the project purpose and design.
noProblem The purpose of the project seems quite clear. The team has explicitly mentioned all the requirements that has been expected of them along with the ways to implement said requirements. There is no testing plan however. They should include that and then the document would be good to go.

noProblem Looks like the team spent some time looking at the code and coming up with the solution. Good Job
noProblem Their explanation is adequate and easy to understand.
noProblem The authors have given adequate explanation in terms of the following what is existing currently, what needs to be changed. The have also explained with a diagram the exact place where they would be adding elements to the UI. Also the files required to be changed are also mentioned. 
noProblem  The suggested changes seem to be appropriate. Explanation was also easy to follow.
noProblem The overall quality of explanations is very detailed and good. I might even take few ideas from here to improve my own design doc.
noProblem  They have explained adequately

noProblem The design seems to be precise. The description of the changes are provided in detail. Team has clearly mentioned about the approach that they will use. Enough efforts have been taken by the team to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it. 
noProblem The team has not proposed any design for the suggested changes.
noProblem  As the project is more of adding features to the user interface of the website , the design plan is covering all the necessary steps that needs to be implemented
noProblem The code design appears to be sound. The UI implementation as shown on the screenshot looks intuitive. However, the final implementation is necessary to say definitively that the code is not smelly 
noProblem Design is good, there might be some changes when they start implementing it but its a good starting point.
noProblem The design appear to be good. Specific gems are also mentioned eg: paginate that would divide the document into discrete pages.
noProblem The design changes as described seem sound.
noProblem I don't see any trace of smells or redundancy in the proposed solution.

noProblem This design cod is fully completed, including project purpose, project design, and testing plan.
noProblem all necessary parts of design document are included.
noProblem Yes, they include project purpose, project design, and testing plan. It's detailed and easy to understand.
noProblem The team has included everything which is required in the documentation in a comprehensive manner. The team has also included test plan for two scenarios.
noProblem The project purpose. design and test plan are all explicit and detailed. Just one suggestion that the structure can be more centralized. For example, the 2.3 and 3.3 may better be together, like Overview and Details, which I think may be more specific.
noProblem All the required parts are in their design.
noProblem Yes the team have incorporated all the functionality required.
noProblem Yes, the design document mentions all the necessary steps and the design ideas for the implementation of them 
noProblem Explained the requiremnts well and their plan - but what they will be changing is vague
noProblem Design appears to account for all needed functionality.
noProblem Yes, they did a great job, incorporate all of the functionality required.
noProblem Yes. all functionalities mentioned in the requirement are listed.

noProblem An explanation for each functionality provided.
noProblem The explanation is complete and easy to understand.
noProblem Design appears to be sound. I would do the same.
noProblem no question there from my point of view, the implementation design is nice.
noProblem From the steps taken by each tasks, I guess they can perform all the functionalities well.
noProblem The design they have right now looks good to me. I did not find any inappropriate design in it.
noProblem The desigin has many details which from my point of view is in the right direction.
noProblem Images were very useful in understanding need/intent for the project.
noProblem They have included a diagram. It do help me understand how they are going to implement this project.

noProblem The doc mentions the changes to be made in a detailed way along with a proper stepwise explanation of the solution or the approach to be taken plus the screenshots which help in better understanding.
noProblem Good work. Good documentation
noProblem The document clearly specifies the problem statement. It seems good enough. They have mentioned the API they are planning to use as well as the files to be modified. However, I would like more details on this API and how they plan to integrate it into their project.
noProblem The document is almost complete. Includes proper planning and demonstration. Only suggestion would be to include more about how the implementation would be done. 
noProblem The Design document states all the required things right from project design to test plan. The doc also specifies what all files will be changes along with how the functionality will look like once the project is deployed.  Suggestion: I feel like the test plan should have been a bit more elaborate. The team did mention one scenario. I feel like there could have been many more. But, as all the required things are present, I am giving this post full stars. 
noProblem Yes, I believe they have included all of the required functionality. 
noProblem The design encompasses all the features in the specification. It only indicates supporting one more language, though, whereas the design document specifies any language. It seems out of the scope of the project, but what if you used the Google's Cloud Translation API to translate the static strings at run time? Then you could support almost any language. There might be licensing issues though.
noProblem Yes, The design document contains all parts of the functionality, ensuring that nothing is missed out.
noProblem Yes, it covers all the functionalities.
noProblem implementation looks just like what the requirement asked for, no removing of English code.
noProblem Implemented major of them
noProblem The design does incorporate all of the necessary functionality.
noProblem yes the required functionality is adequately explained. Good work in that 
noProblem The design incorporates everything that the project document has specified about the project.  No suggestions.
noProblem The explanation provided is on point to the requirement of the project. All the steps piece up the project completely.
noProblem The changes are apt and easy to follow. It makes sense.
noProblem Good explanations for all solutions
noProblem The wireframes themselves make the project self-explanatory. That being said, enough explanation about how the team will tackle the problem statement has been given. Things like what API will be used to achieve the objective has been mentioned. No suggestions.
noProblem The design seemed good.
noProblem The design looks solid, but it's hard to tell without sufficient detail. If anything, causing every static string reference to be encapsulated into an object that uses the current language to return the correct string is more DRY and maintainable than what we have now. I wonder if dynamic translation gems are out there or would work. The claim that dynamic translation should not be done in this project should be defended, e.g. it would take too much time.
noProblem Looking at the doc, it seems like the design is precise. The description of the changes are provided in details ensuring the satisfaction of the reader.
noProblem The design proposed is the natural way anyone would go around solving those issues, for example creating separate yaml files for different languages and then picking up the strings from there. 
noProblem Looks good, only view files are involving the changes.
noProblem well designed
noProblem The design seems sound. The team plans to add all translations of the static variables in a separate folder. I think that this could potentially increase the response time of the system. I would like to see this design in action before making a judgement.
noProblem The document does not go much into the technical details. The limited details provided sounds right. However, more research will generate better understanding.
noProblem The team have showed what they plan to do in the diagrams.
noProblem The diagrams describe the functioning of the project exceptionally.
noProblem Screenshots are helpful to understand the flow and their work
noProblem Screen mock up's are good. 
noProblem The team has done a fantastic job in explaining the design in the initial stage. They have the current scenario and what they plan to do in the project.
noProblem It is extremely detailed!! Eagerly awaiting updates on implementation and on Code Snippets as and when they happen!
noProblem Nice wiki page
noProblem The design doc is fulfilled and written pretty well.
noProblem The design doc is completed and gives exact information on what authors are gonna do.
noProblem  This wiki is dope. They analyze the requirements for the GitHub metrics they would need, and walked the reader through their design considerations. It seems like they have a thorough understanding about how to do this project.
noProblem Well done on adding almost everything. 
noProblem The document is complete. The authors have mentioned each functionality in detail. Also the test plan in explained thoroughly.
noProblem A very well written document, great job 
noProblem All the required part is in the document
noProblem I think the diagrams shown include where you intend to add the metrics, but not how all the metrics will be incorporated, in the next phase make sure to include details for each of these : Total number of commits. Number of files changed. Lines of Code added Lines of code modified. Lines of code deleted. LOCs that survived until final submission - (exclude from MVP due to the complexity and lower priority).
noProblem Yes. Detailed UI mockups were very impressive! The use case diagrams and explanations are well written!
noProblem Yes, The document covers very required functionality.
noProblem Yes.
noProblem Yes, it does
noProblem Yes
noProblem Includes all the functionality. 
noProblem The design doc does mention all of the functionality that the team is supposed to implement along with the different ways they can implement the same.
noProblem Yes, as far as i understand the document cover all the functionality given mentioned. all the github metrics mentioned in the requirements doc  
noProblem  The design contains all of the functionality required.
noProblem The authors proposed in a great detail.
noProblem Explanation is quite easy to understand.
noProblem  They clearly understand this software design process and Expertiza than me, so I trust their judgement.
noProblem They authors have explained it well. They have also mentioned which gems eg Oktokit (Ruby toolkit for GitHub Api) that they plan on using.
noProblem very good. authors have provided all explanations with adequate screen shots and now and after screens 
noProblem  The team explained them design very well. It is easy to follow their idea.
noProblem No problem found. They are trying to implement the DRY principle.
noProblem As far as I can tell, it does not appear that the authors will add unnecessary classes and potentially smell up the code base.
noProblem Design is good.
noProblem  All the design looks reasonable right now.
noProblem The team has done a wonderful job in including UML diagrams and visual aids.
noProblem The visual aids have been well put together. 
noProblem The chart is also in a great detail.
noProblem Visual aids are present which perfectly helps us explain the plan authors have proposed.  
noProblem  Super legit use case diagrams. Some of their pictures even had colours! I liked that!
noProblem Uses UML diagrams and images to explain where the changes will be made.
noProblem There are different diagrams being used: 1. Use case diagram which describes the flow of how different users would navigate to the GitHub metric pages. 2. Mockup of their implementation which details the presence of a separate tab for GitHub metrics integration. They also plan to add some graphs which i think would be very useful to the instructors.
noProblem Yes the doc has use case diagrams and screen shots. this is very good and eases understanding
noProblem  Both the use case diagram and the screenshot they provide helped me understand their purpose.
noProblem Well written
noProblem I think they have done a great job on this doc. It complete and detailed.
noProblem very robust! nearly cover every thing.
noProblem Yes, I believe they have included all of the required functionality. 
noProblem The design document addresses all the functionalities and even the implementation details in the specification.
noProblem  looks good
noProblem Most of them are included.
noProblem The document does say what they're going to do, and that fits fully with the project description.
noProblem yes
noProblem The team have given a proper explanation of how the things will be implemented by specifying the files that needs to be modified. The team have written it in a good manner which is easy to understand.
noProblem Their explanations are detailed and easy to understand.
noProblem The authors have proposed changes in the OffscreenCanvasContextRendering2D.webidl by implementing it similar to HTMLCanvasContextRendering2D ; implement blob API and support webgl contexts as in WebGLRenderingContext. The explanations are quite convincing though a little more detail(including background specifications) would have made the documentation more cogent. 
noProblem The explanation is nicely written.
noProblem nearly perfect
noProblem Yes, the designs appears to be good to me.
noProblem uml diagram is clear!
noProblem The design doc is clean and neat. It specifies the issues and prospective solutions, which are easy to follow.

noProblem Thye provided a lot of solutions, which is great.
noProblem Adequate explanation is provided for each problem. 
noProblem Since, they have not come up with a perfect solution, it seems they have been working on that.
noProblem Changes are adequately explained, easy to follow.
noProblem Though, the solutions proposed are at a very high level, it does make sense. I can't comment on the actual implementation because there isn't much info on that.
noProblem No problem found.
noProblem It looks more or less right in the sense that the proposed changes are exactly what is required to be done in the project.
noProblem The flow seems feasible
noProblem As the project is in the initial stage, there is no technical description.However, I see from the document that their thought process is on the right track. 
noProblem The new design seems to take into account decreasing response time
noProblem Everything has been described well and in details.
noProblem at current state, the design doc has project problem, project solution, and design diagram, and each section has detailed description of the project.
noProblem The document is well structured and provides all required information. 
noProblem The document explains what was asked for
noProblem Yes everything is incorporated.
noProblem All functions required are stated in the design document, which include search for user, assignment, questionnaire, and reviews.
noProblem Yes.
noProblem Yes, they've included all functionalities.
noProblem The design document covers all the possible cases and should be fine.
noProblem Yes it does. They have explained the propose solution as well for each issue.
noProblem Yes, almost everything seems perfect, only a little more explaination is required
noProblem The design incorporates all the basic functionality.
noProblem Yes, almost all types of search functionalities are covered.
noProblem The design implements all the defined functionality elaborately.
noProblem Yes, the design incorporates all of the functionality required and also gives the possible solutions.
noProblem The quality of explanation is good and adequate.
noProblem The changes proposed are good and clearly meet the objectives of the project.
noProblem Good explanations. Easy to follow.
noProblem Overall, the design proposed seems good.
noProblem Yes, the changes are completely feasible
noProblem Did not see much info on the files or classes the changes proposed, so its hard to comment here
noProblem Code level details are not covered in this doc. But the high-level approach looks fine to me.
noProblem Yes they have provided an UML diagram which follows convention and explains their approach
noProblem The team has added sufficient diagrams for the reader
noProblem The diagrams are succinct and well-understood.
noProblem The ER Diagram is very well done. It encompasses all the classes and their attributes. Also the use of different shapes like diamond, square etc is great. 
noProblem uml is missing but er diagram is given. you can add a uml diagram it explains things better. 
noProblem The E-R diagram seems to deliver the task
noProblem Not required for this project
noProblem They have depicted their working strategy through an ER diagram. However, I would suggest them to include more UML diagrams to enhance understandability. Also, the ER diagram is somewhat incomplete.
noProblem There is an ER diagram which defines the relationships in the system.
noProblem Document is very well written and contains all the details like problem statement, solution, files to be modified, testing plan.
noProblem The doc seems complete. All aspects of the problem statement are covered and test plan is also included. A use-case diagram will be useful to add.
noProblem Design doc contains everything in clear explanation
noProblem It incorporates all the functionalites.
noProblem The wiki is detailed enough that it mentions all the functinoalities required in the project. The team has made sure to not miss out on any functionality and they even took out time to list the column names in each report they would add the sort feature to. Good work guys.
noProblem I think the authors have incorporated most of the functionality in the design document.
noProblem Design document contains all the functionality required.
noProblem The design document lists every issue that is being addressed in the project, providing comprehensive details on the functionality that is required for each one.
noProblem Changes look good.
noProblem It is easy to follow the changes that the authors have proposed.
noProblem Adequate explanation was given
noProblem The explanations can be more detailed. Overall understandable.
noProblem Team have shared the link for the TableSorter which explains the functionality
noProblem need some diagram or prototype. 
noProblem Mainly needs html files to be changed and they have mentioned them which looks good 
noProblem The design proposed by the authors appears to be sound. Since this project is only to sort the views, there will be no code added to either the models or controllers. I hope the team only adds one sorting function per view and allows that one function to handle sorting for different columns in that view.
noProblem I don't think the authors plan to add methods to the wrong class. They are modifying the right files. The new design does not appear to potentially make the code "smelly". The team is using one of the existing gems in their design.
noProblem The solution looks like it doesnt add any overhead and the doesnt make the code "smelly"
noProblem The solution seems right.
noProblem The team has not mentioned about how they are planning to do the changes.
noProblem The design data includes most of the important information required to understand the teams plan.
noProblem The doc seems complete. All aspects of the problem statement are covered and test plan is also included. A UML diagram may prove to be useful.
noProblem Good job on UI and test cases. Kindly add UML diagram.
noProblem The project documentation looks complete with clear details about the purpose- to enable the students to better analyze their review based on the suggestion metrics (like volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics). They have delineated the design that includes the files that the team proposes to change (the view- app/views/response/response.html.erb and the partial app/views/submitted_content/_self_review.html.erb), the screenshot of the existing UI of the review section and how the UI would look after the project with the inclusion of a button to analyze and they have specified that a popup displaying the suggestion metrics will emerge when the button is clicked.  I specifically like how the Test plan includes their feature in the Connextra format. They have mentioned 2 scenarios- one where the student clicks the button without entering text in which case the popup alerts the reviewer saying no text for analysis and the regular scenario when the user clicks the analyze button after entering text in which case the popup displays the suggestion metrics. I wish to suggest an additional scenario where the user can intuitively test the quality of the suggestion metrics, based on the review input. Like for example, there can be test cases which show that the suggestion algorithm detects generic reviews that might be seemingly relevant to the topic but add no customization to the project being reviewed (like how some reviewers menially copy paste the same format of the review to all projects with just minor changes). Overall the team has done a great job with the documentation and I look forward to see the implementation of this project in the upcoming review.  
noProblem The design doc is clean and neat. It specifies the issues and prospective solutions, which are easy to follow.
noProblem Yes the documentation looks complete  and states the project purpose and solution are stated . The project design could be described in more detail.
noProblem I cannot find any project purpose, but they did provide a lot of solutions to problems.
noProblem The design looks almost complete in terms of solution-wise details covered.
noProblem Yes, it incorporates all the functionalities.
noProblem Yes it incorporates all of the functionality required.

noProblem As the project is in the initial stage, there is no technical description.However, I see from the document that their thought process is on the right track. 
noProblem The new design seems to take into account decreasing response time
noProblem The design doc is complete and clearly indicates the project objectives. The test plan indicates what aspects are to be tested and screenshots of the proposed analyze button are also posted.
noProblem The document is complete and very clear.
noProblem The doc is complete and everything is included. Very well-written
noProblem The design document gives details about the problem statement and gives an idea about what is to be done in the project. It specifies what files will be modified and the test plan also contains 2 scenarios mentioned. No suggestions.  
noProblem Yes, I think the document includes everything as expected.
noProblem  Yes, the wiki appears to incorporate all of the required functionality. We want students to know if they're giving helpful feedback, and we want the NLP algorithm to be local to the Expertiza project to decrease its reaction time. They have at least shown that they are going to add buttons.
noProblem I could not spot the problem statement of the proposed project in the Google doc containing the list of Problem statements. But on reading the team's design documentation on the wiki page I'm quite satisfied with the functionality that they plan to include. In addition to elucidating the main functional requirement of the project namely- the implementation of the suggestion algorithm the team has also proposed a non-functional requirement of improving the performance and response time of the time it takes to generate the suggestion through the web service.
noProblem Yes, the design document incorporates the plan to implement the functionalities as stated in the problem statement.
noProblem yes all changes are incorporated and explained well.
noProblem The design incorporates most of the functionality required. It would be nice to have a design diagram.
noProblem Yes, they have discussed about all the functionality
noProblem Yes. 
noProblem The design document incorporated all the functionalities that the project is supposed to be implementing.  No suggestions. 
noProblem The authors have mentioned including 'Analyze' buttons for sentiment analysis of different parts of the comments. I think the rationale for this is very good because if they were to send all of the comments at once as input to the API, the results would be a mix of the sentiments of all the different comments and would therefore not be accurate. Also this way, I think that the response time of the system would not be affected by a whole lot.
noProblem The explanation is good and clearly indicates the project objectives.
noProblem I am able to understand the purpose of the project.
noProblem Please add more information on the NLP algorithm team is trying to use.
noProblem The team has has listed the 2 files that they propose to change namely - the view- app/views/response/response.html.erb and the partial app/views/submitted_content/_self_review.html.erb. However, they could have described what these files currently do and their purpose in the documentation. The authors have embedded screenshots of how the UI of the review page will look after the Analyze button will be included. They have specified that a pop up showing the suggestion metrics pertaining to a review namely - volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics will be generated once the button is clicked.
noProblem The explanation is pretty good, I particularly found the images explaining what all they are going to add pretty intuitive.
noProblem changes are explained well. suggestion detection algorithm an be explained a bit more or how exactly you will be using it. probably some code snippets would help explaining that.
noProblem The team has done a fantastic job in explaining the design in the initial stage. They have the current scenario and what they plan to do in the project.
noProblem It is extremely detailed!! Eagerly awaiting updates on implementation and on Code Snippets as and when they happen!
noProblem Nice wiki page
noProblem The design doc is fulfilled and written pretty well.
noProblem The design doc is completed and gives exact information on what authors are gonna do.
noProblem The explanations are lucid.
noProblem The design seems to be following DRY principle. 
noProblem I don't think the authors plan to add methods to a wrong class. They seem to be working on the right class namely Review and its associated view page review.html.erb that exactly pertains to their project. The response time might potentially increase with this new feature. But fortunately the team has proposed to work on optimizing the suggestion algorithm so that it does not take forever to execute. The team has done a good job on the design documentation.
noProblem The design appears to be sound, and wouldn't conflict with the existing classes or methods. 
noProblem 2 html files require change, i don't think it will affect anything.
noProblem Yes it completes functionality.
noProblem Yes the design seems to follow all of the functionalities required. It looks like they have gone through the Project description in a good manner.
noProblem The design incorporates all of the functionality required.
noProblem The team has done a good job in explaining the project and its purpose with the design and files that need to be changed. However,  Test plan is provided.

noProblem The design has pretty much covered all the requested functionality. 
noProblem The chart is very clear.
noProblem No changes proposed.
noProblem the team has explained the implementation design/strategy in detail. the design was explained with all the required details and was very easy to understand.  
noProblem Not everything
noProblem Yes it looks good
noProblem Yes. Document incorporate all the functionalities mentioned in the problem statement assign. 
noProblem 1. Team technically understand the change and proposed solution does not lead to adding methods in wrong classes. 2. New design should not make the code smelly. 3. Changes are logical and proposed solution is reasonable enough. No gem required. 4. It should not increase response time. 5. No, the plan is nice and should be taken forward. 
noProblem The design document contains all the functionality required.
noProblem The design does incorporate the functionalities required. It is descriptive and easy to understand.
noProblem No problem found.
noProblem The design incorporates all the functionality which are required. 
noProblem No design proposed.
noProblem The screenshots posted give a clear picture of the intended output. It would be nice to have a design diagram.
noProblem It would be better to add more diagrams.
noProblem Changes proposed by authors are viable.
noProblem It was easy to follow. 
noProblem Can't comment on it right now
noProblem Adequate diagrams are given. Explanation of problem statement done well.
noProblem Looks fine
noProblem Design document has all the necessary information like project design, test plan. The team has gone through their topic deeply and can be seen by their illustration of their implementation. Also, they have included code snippets which show thoroughness of their approach 
noProblem All necessary sections are present.

noProblem The team proposed to add a bar graph to give a pictorial view of the scores and indicate the performance of students.
noProblem The changes proposed by the team include implementing a bar chart, stacked or single. Based upon the project description, it is advised that the team look for other alternatives like pie chart that would help to span the results with a minimal look.       
noProblem A simple enough explanation has been provided for the functionality.  No suggestions.
noProblem For Now the design proposed looks perfect.
noProblem Design flow looks good.
noProblem The authors seem to have studied the code well and have thought of a good plan to implement the project. They also seem to follow DRY principles while adding and changing code. Also the new design flow is quite simple and easy to understand which can be implemented without any high degree of convoluted code.
noProblem The design changes as described are sound, they are mostly on Javascript for the visualization and dont potentially make the code "smelly"
noProblem The UML diagram included here is a flow chart diagram , which explains the process of how the instructor will be able to see the visualization and is easy to understand the flow
noProblem Design flow diagram is included indicating the flow which is good.
noProblem The UML diagrams is great, which is clear and easy to understand.
noProblem The team has provided a flow diagram that helps to infer the structural outline of the project. The scope of the project can be perceived from the diagram.
noProblem Two graphs provided provide a good understanding of the process and what expected visualization should be. More diagrams would have been helpful.
noProblem The team has presented a detailed explanation of  all the topics in the documentation
noProblem Following can be added. Project Introduction & Motivation Description of Project
noProblem The document includes the problem statements and proposed solutions of all the issues. All the proposed solutions have test plans as well.
noProblem The design does corporate all the functionalities required.
noProblem Yes, the doc covers every functionality and detailed description of the approach to deal with the issue. 
noProblem The design proposes solutions for all the issues. Every issue is well described and flow diagrams are provided for the solutions
noProblem They have each listed bug explained, at the very least, and most have a resolution pathway. A+.
noProblem The document incorporates all of the functionalities as mentioned in the google design document. The team have made sure to list, explain, and provide proposed solutions for each bug to be fixed. Good Job guys !!!
noProblem Yes, I think it includes everything, all the functionalities required. 
noProblem The design incorporates all the functionality required. Suggestion: Including screenshots or screen-mockups would make the document easier to understand.
noProblem Yes they have incorporated everything. They have explained the solutions as well.
noProblem It lists out all the functionalities in the problem solution and looks very clear and very elaborate with codes and diagrams.
noProblem The team has included all the 5 issues as stated in the project description google doc. The team has provided solutions for all these issues as well. The solutions are descriptive and easy to follow
noProblem The design document separately describes every distinct issue and in some cases even provides possible finalized fixes to the source code.
noProblem The authors have listed all the proposed changes in the problem solution. I was able to understand it without any trouble.  Overall quality of the proposals is good.
noProblem The document is very impressive and provides detailed description of all the proposed changes. Explanations and steps given are easy to follow. No suggestions.
noProblem Well, after reading all the proposed solutions, I think they look good and the explanation behind all of them are satisfactory as well.
noProblem For the bugs which have explanations, the proposed fixes and explanations of the problem are sound. I'd like more info on bugs #1017 and #1072, as they only have the flow.
noProblem The good thing about this wiki is that the proposed solution sections is brilliantly explained. The team have clearly mentioned all filenames where they propose to make changes, drawn diagrams to illustrate the flow control, and added snippets of code where necessary. Brilliant
noProblem The explanations are well written and describe the workflow well. There could have been a little more detail in the explanation as some of the statements are very high level.
noProblem The changes mentioned seems to be well thought and written as they are well explanatory. With adequate description, the doc covers all the issues.
noProblem The designs proposed makes some sense as they are backed up with diagrams to make them very clear of their approach.
noProblem Honestly in my opinion, the team has given a lot of thought into how to fix the bugs. The design/proposed solutions look completely logical and should fix the bugs with no/least redundancy. It also looks like the team has already managed to fix a few bugs as well. Kudos to them.
noProblem The proposed solution would be the best approach to tackle the issues in my opinion. They would not make the code smelly or complicated.
noProblem For now design plan looks good enough.
noProblem It appears to be sound.    
noProblem The diagrams that are provided in the document visualize the workflows of different actors that pertain to the given issues. They are definitely helpful for the reader to understand the scope of the problem that is being addressed.
noProblem The team has provided flowcharts which makes it easier to understand their solution. The provided diagrams seem enough for the reader to understand the solution.
noProblem Visual aids are used properly and very helpful in understanding. UML diagrams follow the convention. Everything looks proper.
noProblem Uml looks good, explains whats happening.
noProblem They have included flowcharts for each proposed solution. The flowcharts can clearly explain the work flow.
noProblem All the diagrams are great, and none feel extraneous.
noProblem The diagrams provided clearly explain the flow control of the proposed solutions. The team even mentions preconditions needed for the flow control. the only suggestion I have is that the team could also add a low-fi sketch or screenshot of how the view would like after before/after Issue #1008 is fixed.
noProblem Flow diagrams are well thought of and explain the workflow well. Adequate details are given for each diagram.
noProblem Diagrams are proper, precise and detailed to understand the behaviour of the system (currently and after making changes). Good effort in making the diagram and wiki.
noProblem The design looks fine but no explanation as to why this is done? Is it already existing or is this a new feature?
noProblem The UML is good. Liked the way they have clearly mentioned the functions.
noProblem The step by step instructions are detailed and is good.
noProblem Yes the design looks complete
noProblem Implementation details haven't been added yet but that's fine as it hasn't been started yet.
noProblem A very nice UML diagram is added explaining the cases.
noProblem Yes. The design document incorporates all the functionalities stated in problem statement. 
noProblem Document is explained well. Also the flow of document is good. Team can add screenshots of existing documents, also some diagram to explain the solution well.
noProblem 1. Authors solution do not seem to create methods to wrong classes. 2. New design code does not make the code "smelly". 3. No new gem required. Explained solution is adequate. 4. Proposed design should not hamper system performance. 5. Well efforts expended on the design  
noProblem The team has done a commendable job in creating a very detailed UML diagram and explaining the case of every user very well.
noProblem Test plan is to be added, but the purpose and the design are coherent and easy to follow.
noProblem Includes everything, as far as I can tell.
noProblem The proposed flows and project tasks are sufficiently detailed that I can understand the relationship between the issue and how they're going to solve it in each step.
noProblem I don't have any issues with the design, looking forward to seeing some code snippets to understand it better.
noProblem The high-level design which is needed to start with the work looks prominent. As the project proceeds, few intricacies resulting due to design conflicts, scalability need to be addressed as and when required. But the team has laid out a solid foundation to begin with.
noProblem The authors have explained the workflow very well with respect to the different types of users involved in the particular feature. The language is simple to follow.
noProblem Use case diagram adds extra weight to the design since the visuals always help the reader to relate the project well.
noProblem The design does incorporate the functionality required of making reviews public allowing the students to toggle the visibility of review submitted. It is descriptive and easy to understand.
noProblem The proposals given by the team are reasonable and adequately cover the features to be established during the course of the project. The changes suggested follow the desired requirements. 
noProblem As mentioned in their Approach section, the team decided on adding some functionalities like checkboxes and views. I find these changes perfect for the problem statement given.
noProblem They have used a USE case diagram to explain flow. I found it quite understandable and all the steps are clearly drawn out in the diagram. It clearly explains the steps required to approach a situation.
noProblem The explanations are very clear and easy to follow. They give the idea of how team intends to approach the feature.
noProblem I think overall it looks good. However, a bit more low-level details may give better insight about such issues.
noProblem Yes, it does
noProblem Created a great visual aid which helps us explain the plan.
noProblem Document is very well written and contains all the details like problem statement, solution, files to be modified, testing plan.
noProblem The write-up is very minimal. I think it should elaborate made 
noProblem It says what they will do, but it seems high level. Would appreciate some diagrams or mockups
noProblem Design doc contains everything in clear explanation
noProblem It incorporates all the functionalites.
noProblem Though the pull request has been passed, but the writeup does not explain the details of the implementation, like what sorting algorithm the team has implemented using jQuery etc. The design part of the writeup is very hollow, and needs further refinement.
noProblem The wiki is detailed enough that it mentions all the functinoalities required in the project. The team has made sure to not miss out on any functionality and they even took out time to list the column names in each report they would add the sort feature to. Good work guys.
noProblem I think the authors have incorporated most of the functionality in the design document.
noProblem Design document contains all the functionality required.
noProblem Please add more details about the solution. How to code for that functionality is yet to be thought of.
noProblem Yes, as per the solution provided, it does seem that the design incorporates the required functionality. It considers sorting on all the specified fields. Suggestions: Since you have mentioned the use of jQuery tablesorte, you may also add explanation as to what is tablesorter and try explaining atleast for one field (e.g. name) as to how does it work to sort the entries.    
noProblem The design document lists every issue that is being addressed in the project, providing comprehensive details on the functionality that is required for each one.
noProblem Changes look good.
noProblem could use more detail
noProblem It is easy to follow the changes that the authors have proposed.
noProblem Adequate explanation was given
noProblem Solutions have been proposed. How they are going to do that is not mentioned.
noProblem Team have shared the link for the TableSorter which explains the functionality
noProblem The authors provide a list of files that will be modified in the scope of this project and a high level overview of what needs to be done. The rationale behind using a tablesorter jQuery library and defining the code in the script seems reasonable but the team needs to discuss more details to further clarity the solution. 
noProblem need some diagram or prototype. 
noProblem Mainly needs html files to be changed and they have mentioned them which looks good 
noProblem As mentioned above, the design part is pretty weak for a writeup, and needs to be further worked upon.
noProblem The design proposed by the authors appears to be sound. Since this project is only to sort the views, there will be no code added to either the models or controllers. I hope the team only adds one sorting function per view and allows that one function to handle sorting for different columns in that view.
noProblem I don't think the authors plan to add methods to the wrong class. They are modifying the right files. The new design does not appear to potentially make the code "smelly". The team is using one of the existing gems in their design.
noProblem The solution looks like it doesnt add any overhead and the doesnt make the code "smelly"
noProblem The solution seems right.
noProblem The team has not mentioned about how they are planning to do the changes.
noProblem Wrtie up clearly explains the project purpose, what changes needs to be made, however including a mock test plan would have been better.
noProblem The team has done a fantastic job in explaining the design in the initial stage. They have the current scenario and what they plan to do in the project.
noProblem It is extremely detailed!! Eagerly awaiting updates on implementation and on Code Snippets as and when they happen!
noProblem Nice wiki page
noProblem The design doc is fulfilled and written pretty well.
noProblem The design doc is completed and gives exact information on what authors are gonna do.
noProblem  This wiki is dope. They analyze the requirements for the GitHub metrics they would need, and walked the reader through their design considerations. It seems like they have a thorough understanding about how to do this project.
noProblem Well done on adding almost everything. 
noProblem The document is complete. The authors have mentioned each functionality in detail. Also the test plan in explained thoroughly.
noProblem A very well written document, great job 
noProblem All the required part is in the document
noProblem Yes. Detailed UI mockups were very impressive! The use case diagrams and explanations are well written!

noProblem Yes, as far as i understand the document cover all the functionality given mentioned. all the github metrics mentioned in the requirements doc  
noProblem  The design contains all of the functionality required.
noProblem The explanation was perfectly organized and flowing. Could not have been any better! A sample request response of GitHub metric API would've made it more amazing!
noProblem The authors proposed in a great detail.
noProblem Explanation is quite easy to understand.
noProblem  They clearly understand this software design process and Expertiza than me, so I trust their judgement.
noProblem They authors have explained it well. They have also mentioned which gems eg Oktokit (Ruby toolkit for GitHub Api) that they plan on using.
noProblem The explanation given by the authors was pretty straightforward. Looking at the explanations it looks like the authors have thought about different aspects of the problem statement and also of different ways to implement the GitHub metrics integration feature along with the side effects of implementing it in a particular way. e.g one would think that adding the metrics to the database would be a sound solution but given the nature of an open source project and the fact that students would commit beyond the deadline the authors have thought not to add the metrics to the database which is sound and reasonable.
noProblem very good. authors have provided all explanations with adequate screen shots and now and after screens 
noProblem  The team explained them design very well. It is easy to follow their idea.
noProblem No problem found. They are trying to implement the DRY principle.
noProblem As far as I can tell, it does not appear that the authors will add unnecessary classes and potentially smell up the code base.
noProblem Design is good.
noProblem  All the design looks reasonable right now.
noProblem The team has done a wonderful job in including UML diagrams and visual aids.
noProblem The visual aids have been well put together. 
noProblem The chart is also in a great detail.
noProblem Visual aids are present which perfectly helps us explain the plan authors have proposed.  
noProblem  Super legit use case diagrams. Some of their pictures even had colours! I liked that!
noProblem Uses UML diagrams and images to explain where the changes will be made.
noProblem There are different diagrams being used: 1. Use case diagram which describes the flow of how different users would navigate to the GitHub metric pages. 2. Mockup of their implementation which details the presence of a separate tab for GitHub metrics integration. They also plan to add some graphs which i think would be very useful to the instructors.
noProblem Yes the doc has use case diagrams and screen shots. this is very good and eases understanding
noProblem  Both the use case diagram and the screenshot they provide helped me understand their purpose.
noProblem The Design document states all the required things right from project design to test plan. Files that will be changed along with how functionality will work/flow are included in the doc clearly.  Suggestion: great work! no suggestions required.
noProblem The design doc is complete. All the relevant sections have been added.
noProblem Document looks complete.
noProblem The design doc clearly explains the project purpose, project design and the test plan.

noProblem Design document has outlined the project requirement and issues. They have proposed a solution to each problem. they have even figured the files and methods to be modified. Overall, it looks good.
noProblem The design contains all of the functionality that required.
noProblem Yes, it is complete
noProblem The explanation provided is on point to the requirement of the project. All the steps piece up the project completely. No suggestions.
noProblem Very clear, very well organized.
noProblem The flowchart makes it very clear.
noProblem Everything is explained well and easy to understand.
noProblem The team has explained the solution with flow charts and code snippets. They have even considered the feasibility of their solution which is a good thing as this is a big project so feasibility is a big factor. 
noProblem They explained their plan very well. Both the visual aid and the word they use are very clear.
noProblem Adequate information given on implementing the solution. Flow charts are impressive.
noProblem Great efforts have been taken to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it. The design will definitely increase the response time. Suggestion: Information about the methods that will be implemented is not given in the design document Availability of such info would have been helpful.
noProblem Though I couldn't follow everything, overall, the design seems to do the right thing.
noProblem As stated above all the references needs to be checked as signup sheet controller is populating the database and every field should be available to maintain consistency.
noProblem There is nothing wrong in current design. Looks good. Suggestion: However Since I have already worked on a similar assignment so I know that similar issue has already been resolved for drop topic deadline. You can reuse the entire code and just change deadline type. Have a look at OSS project topic- 1843.  Check with the Professor once.
noProblem All proposed changes seem to be in line with good coding practices and the expertiza system guidelines.
noProblem Their solution sounds good. 
noProblem The design they have right now looks good to me. It does not have any issue.
noProblem not show which method
noProblem The use of flowcharts describe the functioning of the project exceptionally. Suggestion: Including screen mockups to your doc will add more weight to it.
noProblem Clearly defined UML (+1)
noProblem Uml diagrams mentioned are excellent and to the mark.
noProblem Diagrams are very clear and well explained!
noProblem No diagrams shown
noProblem One of the best wikis I have reviewed with good diagrams and explanations. The flow diagrams are really good. Kudos

noProblem no such things like UML.
noProblem The design document looks really good. All sections are properly described, screenshots included. A possible uml or workflow diagram would have been appreciated.
noProblem All the features are mentioned in the design document. It explains the background and the approach that they are going to take to create the view aggregating all the information.
noProblem Very well maintained and explained
noProblem The document is complete and well structured. They have also incorporated the prototype comments and mentor's feedback. 
noProblem This documentation is the first one to clearly give a background for the project, out of all the documentations that I have reviewed until now. Kudos to the team for taking that extra mile. They have clarified the purpose of this project under the Task heading as: to provide a holistic insight into the performance of each student in a class as an objective. The project design includes the view and controller section that projects the requirements of the project. I like how the team has listed all the information to be presented in the Grade Summary. The documentation finally contains the Test plan, where they propose to do controller tests to check if the correct model method is called and if the objects of appropriate datatype are returned and also if the correct view is rendered. They have also listed 2 feature tests to see if the correct information is being rendered on the view. The team could have added more such tests like: to test if the sorting functionality works fine
noProblem The document is well made with necessary snapshots.
noProblem The design doc submitted is pretty neat and contains all the necessary information to understand the requirements of the project.
noProblem The design doc is clear and well written. The authors have done a great job explaining the project's purpose and their design plan with the use of LoFi sketch and prototype for the required view. I would suggest the team to include files that are involved for this project. Overall good work!
noProblem The design doc is complete and clearly includes all details about the project.
noProblem Complete, and well-explained. Impressed by 'Background' paragraph. Also, the screenshot of problem statement and solution is thorough.
noProblem This design documentation is very crisp and clear. Explained in detail and well organized.
noProblem Yes, the design document does incorporate all the functionality. There are proposed test plans, so expecting more screenshots with test cases in it.
noProblem Yes. It includes all the functionality.
noProblem Yes. it incorporates with the functionality 
noProblem yes
noProblem The design does incorporate all of the functionalities. One suggestion that I can give in the context of the design is that the documentation could have covered the list of files that they plan to work on and the current version of that code. They could have shown a UML diagram of the flow of activities for a lucid understandability 
noProblem Yes, according to the given link, the design has incorporated all the requirements and mentioned their test plan as well
noProblem The design incorporates all the primary functionality, however adding a UML diagram would make it much better
noProblem Yes, I do not find any information missing.
noProblem The authors have incorporated all the functionalities required.
noProblem The proposed changes look good, explanations are clear. Also, mentioned the continuous talk with mentor to come up with a prototype. Suggest you to include screenshots of some positive and negative tests in the future submissions.  
noProblem Adequate explanation is provided. They also mention what tests are feasible to be performed.
noProblem yes, all of them are implemented with good quality of explanation
noProblem Explanations are very clear and simple to understand.
noProblem The proposed implementation design is elaborate and clearly defines what the team plans on doing.

noProblem Design appears to be good.  
noProblem Well designed
noProblem Proper design as well as test features are mentioned.
noProblem According to me, the given design incorporates all the expected outcomes without disturbing the current functionality.
noProblem Looks like a lot of effort will go into the VIEW
noProblem The document explains where the changes will be made and also gives screenshots of the appropriate views.
noProblem Screenshots are helpful to understand the flow
noProblem Screenshots and visual ques are provided to the user
noProblem The screenshots posted on the wiki page provide a clear picture of what the team seeks to achieve.
noProblem Very well explained with sketches and UML diagrams. The diagrams are detailed and easy to understand.
noProblem Even thought there aren't any UML diagrams, the team has added a wire frame design of the proposed page and it has helped in visualizing the solution.
noProblem Yes.
noProblem The project is complete and sound enough in its approach and the implementations and the test plan has been well devised and just shy of application.
noProblem No everything is properly described.
noProblem The doc is very succinct and well written!  
noProblem The team has included all the topics required for the documentation.
noProblem The authors have explained the changes in a brief manner which are easy to understand
noProblem The explanation is descriptive and explains the logic behind the solution which is think should work. However, I believe that team should can add the explanation about the files and classes they tend to make changes in. The team can now focus on implementation of the code.
noProblem Yes it incorporates all the required functionalities along with the test cases
noProblem Yes, the required functionality is covered with details in the document.
noProblem Yes, I believe they have included all of the required functionality. 
noProblem Yes, their sections Method to calculate Composite Score and Application Flow sections have a flow chart as well as at least a targeted section of the code which they have planned to work upon.

noProblem The team has suggested reasonable changes to address the problem statement and has given explanation for each solution they have proposed for the implementation.
noProblem Yes, in my opinion the team has understood the topic well and clearly listed all the functionality as described in the design document. Good Job !!
noProblem The project purpose is well defined and clearly explains what this project aims to do. The team also identifies the strategies they wish to adopt to fix the issue. This explanation is clear and concise. However, I would also suggest the team to add a basic test plan, on how they would test the functionality they add. Also I suggest them to list down the list of files they would be changing.
noProblem The authors propose changes in an extremely concise manner. The idea that the team proposes to follow seems logical, but I would suggest them to include a dummy example or sample pseudocode so that the english explanantion is backed up with an idea of the code as well. Such as this-: 1) Review X is submitted 2) Loop through Review 1......n If abs(Review n score - Review X score) >= (some value) store Review n URL in list  
noProblem The authors propose a sound logic to improve the functionality required. However, I would suggest the team to think about looping over each and every review. This may increase the response time of the system. Perhaps more interaction with the instructors could help the team come up with a less complex solution.
noProblem The changes are much that is required just some calculated approach of the score which the author has mentioned and seems will be working
noProblem The document seems complete.
noProblem Could be more specific, especially with test plan.
noProblem Just overview is presented which is explained properly. The technical design is not explained in depth.
noProblem The design is rather straightforward, incorporates all the functionality required.
noProblem Changes are suggested in a well manner but could have been explained in more details.
noProblem The explanations are brief and to the point, thought that seems to be due to the nature of the problem statement itself.
noProblem The changes are clearly stated and represented. 
noProblem Yes, they include project purpose, project design, and testing plan. It's a little short. It's suggested that add more details.  
noProblem Yes, they include all the functionality in the wiki page. They can work it better if they add more details and some visual aids.
noProblem The design appears to be complete.
noProblem They did explain what they want to do. It's easy to understand and seems reasonable. They can make it more explicit and clear by making it step by step.
noProblem The design appears to be perfect for now  except for the flow diagram
noProblem This design is good. There are no visual aids. Maybe they can consider use it to make it more detailed.
noProblem The design gives a proper explanation of the behavior of the system/functionality
noProblem The design covers the functionalities but there seem to be no concrete solutions for the same. Some more explanations is expected.
noProblem Although it looks like a good start the team can still improve on the design by adding a UML diagram and a test plan. There is a need for a low-level design explanation so that others can understand the technical details of the implementation.
noProblem Have explained the project as according to the given description.
noProblem NO UML diagram is provided so cant comment.
noProblem Yes, the designs appears to be good to me. I believe the diagram shown in wiki helped me to understand their understanding
noProblem The design looks reasonable for me.
noProblem The application plan diagram has been shown. It distinguishes between Instructor and Student.

noProblem The flow diagrams are well written and it is easy to understand just looking at them.
noProblem The document seems complete.
noProblem Not explained properly
noProblem Yes, in my opinion the team has understood the topic well and clearly listed all the functionality as described in the design document. Good Job !!
noProblem The design is rather straightforward, incorporates all the functionality required.
noProblem Have explained the project as according to the given description.
noProblem No changes
noProblem Not much described to rate over
noProblem The authors have explained the changes in a brief manner which are easy to understand
noProblem It looks to me from the document that the authors are clear about their implementation. Suggestion: They can elaborate more by specifying how do they intend to store the URLs to the reviews, how are they identifying the two distinctly different reviews. They can also add a basic flow of their proposed solution. This will enhance the explanation.
noProblem The explanations are brief and to the point, thought that seems to be due to the nature of the problem statement itself.
noProblem The design appears to be complete.
noProblem The explanation is descriptive and explains the logic behind the solution which is think should work. However, I believe that team should can add the explanation about the files and classes they tend to make changes in. The team can now focus on implementation of the code.
noProblem The team has done a fantastic job in explaining the design in the initial stage. They have the current scenario and what they plan to do in the project.
noProblem It is extremely detailed!! Eagerly awaiting updates on implementation and on Code Snippets as and when they happen!
noProblem Nice wiki page

noProblem Very good explanation and good work on giving alternatives. It would have been great if the team had added DB design as well but the work done is sufficient. 
noProblem They authors have explained it well. They have also mentioned which gems eg Oktokit (Ruby toolkit for GitHub Api) that they plan on using.
noProblem The explanation given by the authors was pretty straightforward. Looking at the explanations it looks like the authors have thought about different aspects of the problem statement and also of different ways to implement the GitHub metrics integration feature along with the side effects of implementing it in a particular way. e.g one would think that adding the metrics to the database would be a sound solution but given the nature of an open source project and the fact that students would commit beyond the deadline the authors have thought not to add the metrics to the database which is sound and reasonable.
noProblem very good. authors have provided all explanations with adequate screen shots and now and after screens 
noProblem  The team explained them design very well. It is easy to follow their idea.
noProblem No problem found. They are trying to implement the DRY principle.
noProblem As far as I can tell, it does not appear that the authors will add unnecessary classes and potentially smell up the code base.
noProblem Design is good.
noProblem  All the design looks reasonable right now.
noProblem The team has done a wonderful job in including UML diagrams and visual aids.
noProblem The visual aids have been well put together. 
noProblem The chart is also in a great detail.
noProblem Visual aids are present which perfectly helps us explain the plan authors have proposed.  
noProblem  Super legit use case diagrams. Some of their pictures even had colours! I liked that!
noProblem Proper use case diagram have been added. For next submission team can add UML diagrams.
noProblem Uses UML diagrams and images to explain where the changes will be made.
noProblem There are different diagrams being used: 1. Use case diagram which describes the flow of how different users would navigate to the GitHub metric pages. 2. Mockup of their implementation which details the presence of a separate tab for GitHub metrics integration. They also plan to add some graphs which i think would be very useful to the instructors.
noProblem Yes the doc has use case diagrams and screen shots. this is very good and eases understanding
noProblem  Both the use case diagram and the screenshot they provide helped me understand their purpose.
noProblem Well done on adding almost everything. 
noProblem The document is complete. The authors have mentioned each functionality in detail. Also the test plan in explained thoroughly.
noProblem A very well written document, great job 
noProblem All the required part is in the document
noProblem Yes. Detailed UI mockups were very impressive! The use case diagrams and explanations are well written!
noProblem Yes, The document covers very required functionality.
noProblem Yes.
noProblem Yes, it does
noProblem Yes
noProblem Includes all the functionality. 
noProblem Yes, as far as i understand the document cover all the functionality given mentioned. all the github metrics mentioned in the requirements doc  
noProblem The design doc does mention all of the functionality that the team is supposed to implement along with the different ways they can implement the same.
noProblem  The design contains all of the functionality required.
noProblem The explanation was perfectly organized and flowing. Could not have been any better! A sample request response of GitHub metric API would've made it more amazing!
noProblem The authors proposed in a great detail.
noProblem Explanation is quite easy to understand.

noProblem Yes the doc has use case diagrams and screen shots. this is very good and eases understanding
noProblem  Both the use case diagram and the screenshot they provide helped me understand their purpose.
noProblem Design document has all the necessary information like project design, test plan. The team has gone through their topic deeply and can be seen by their illustration of their implementation. Also, they have included code snippets which show thoroughness of their approach 
noProblem The design doc contains project purpose, project design and testing plan in the wiki. The wiki contains mock visualizations which make it easy to understand the project proposal and how are they planning to do. The design flow as a flow chart adds to the ease of understanding. The test plan explains about the technologies that they are planning to use for testing. Suggestion:  The test plan could say what should be done in testing than just the technologies to be used for a particular part of code. For ed, we plan to have a dummy small data and see if the graphs output the visualizations correctly, if the sum id being counted to 100% of the class participation etc... the stacked version could also have been represented for better understanding.
noProblem The document shows the flow of work really well.However, I would like to suggest to put more of test planning and the tools and technologies that will be used. This will enhance the quality of the document to a great extent.
noProblem The design doc is good and provides a clear picture about the objective of the project. However,It would also be nice to know what features would be tested in the test plan.
noProblem All necessary sections are present.
noProblem Yes the design incorporates all of the functionalities
noProblem Incorporates intended functionality.
noProblem Yes, their design has all of the functionality that are required.
noProblem The design document has included all the functionality that is required by the project description.
noProblem Yes
noProblem The design has a good design flow diagram which is clear and concise.
noProblem The design follows the basic functionality expected by proposing a bar graph solution for the select criteria. It could incorporate the rubrics that the team are planning to target. The flow in general does help to understand the project.
noProblem The design document incorporated all the functionalities that the project is supposed to be implementing.  No suggestions. 
noProblem Yes
noProblem Changes suggested look good.
noProblem the team has mentioned all the files that will be changed and have also written a paragraph stating what are the proposed changes. The team could also document the changes that are being made to individual code files stating the changes done using code snippets and the reason why the changes are being made. Also they can talk about what design patterns principle are being used to incorporate the functionality that is being proposed. The team could also use CRC cards to depict the proposed code changes. This will not only help readers understand the report better but also help the team in dividing work between the team members and fast tracking the completion of project.
noProblem The changes proposed for the Class performance is adequate and explains the files to be changed, what changes from the controller perspective and views perspective. no particular suggestions proposed
noProblem The team proposed to add a bar graph to give a pictorial view of the scores and indicate the performance of students.
noProblem More explanation around only those two graphs are being considered is needed. While its early in the project, at least what changes will be made to a file could have been mentioned.
noProblem proposed changes needs more explanation at the files and system specifically what files needs to be changed and how
noProblem The changes proposed by the team include implementing a bar chart, stacked or single. Based upon the project description, it is advised that the team look for other alternatives like pie chart that would help to span the results with a minimal look.       
noProblem A simple enough explanation has been provided for the functionality.  No suggestions.
noProblem For Now the design proposed looks perfect.
noProblem Design flow looks good.
noProblem The authors seem to have studied the code well and have thought of a good plan to implement the project. They also seem to follow DRY principles while adding and changing code. Also the new design flow is quite simple and easy to understand which can be implemented without any high degree of convoluted code.
noProblem The design changes as described are sound, they are mostly on Javascript for the visualization and dont potentially make the code "smelly"
noProblem The design looks good enough. It mostly deals with html.erb files to accommodate the graph and some database filtering in the controllers.I do not think that the design will increase the responses time of the system. Suggestion: If the details regarding how the graph will be implemented or any gem will be used should have been given. I did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality. That too would have been useful. 
noProblem The UML diagram included here is a flow chart diagram , which explains the process of how the instructor will be able to see the visualization and is easy to understand the flow
noProblem The UML diagrams is great, which is clear and easy to understand.
noProblem The design diagram is good and it would also be helpful to have a few screenshots of the current expertiza view.
noProblem The team has provided a flow diagram that helps to infer the structural outline of the project. The scope of the project can be perceived from the diagram.
noProblem A flowchart and graph has been shown in the documentation.  Suggestions: I feel that there should have been mockups of the screens where the functionality will actually appear. Team should have shown how the solution would look like on the expertiza page. There could have been use case diagrams too. 
noProblem Two graphs provided provide a good understanding of the process and what expected visualization should be. More diagrams would have been helpful.
noProblem The design document gives a clear picture of the intended functionality of the project but it should have included test cases or what would be tested.
noProblem Yes everything is incorporated.
noProblem Yes.
noProblem Yes, they've included all functionalities.
noProblem The design document covers all the possible cases and should be fine.
noProblem The quality of explanation is good and adequate.
noProblem The changes proposed are good and clearly meet the objectives of the project.
noProblem Overall, the design proposed seems good.
noProblem The authors do not talk much about the technical aspects of how they are going to implement their work. The new design they proposed however seem to go on the right track. However, not much research is done till now.
noProblem Just one ER diagram. Add use case and activity/flow diagrams.
noProblem There is an ER diagram helps the reviewer understand the relationship between different sets. Maybe more screenshot can be provided to show where is the search bar, etc.
noProblem The entire project flow is well documented along with the basic structural requirements. The document aligns with the plan of action and showcases the exact purpose of the project.
noProblem The project design doc is complete and specifies both issues and prospective solutions.
noProblem The doc mentions the changes to be made in a detailed way along with a proper stepwise explanation of the solution or the approach to be taken plus the screenshots which help in better understanding.
noProblem Good work. Good documentation
noProblem The document seems complete.
noProblem Yes, they include project purpose, project design, and testing plan. It's a little short. It's suggested that add more details.  
noProblem Could have been explained more
noProblem The team has included all the topics required for the documentation.
noProblem Yes, in my opinion the team has understood the topic well and clearly listed all the functionality as described in the design document. Good Job !!
noProblem Yes, they include all the functionality in the wiki page. They can work it better if they add more details and some visual aids.
noProblem The design is rather straightforward, incorporates all the functionality required.
noProblem Have explained the project as according to the given description.
noProblem The authors propose changes in an extremely concise manner. The idea that the team proposes to follow seems logical, but I would suggest them to include a dummy example or sample pseudocode so that the english explanantion is backed up with an idea of the code as well. Such as this-: 1) Review X is submitted 2) Loop through Review 1......n If abs(Review n score - Review X score) >= (some value) store Review n URL in list  
noProblem They did explain what they want to do. It's easy to understand and seems reasonable. They can make it more explicit and clear by making it step by step.
noProblem Not much described to rate over
noProblem The authors have explained the changes in a brief manner which are easy to understand
noProblem It looks to me from the document that the authors are clear about their implementation. Suggestion: They can elaborate more by specifying how do they intend to store the URLs to the reviews, how are they identifying the two distinctly different reviews. They can also add a basic flow of their proposed solution. This will enhance the explanation.
noProblem The explanations are brief and to the point, thought that seems to be due to the nature of the problem statement itself.
noProblem The authors propose a sound logic to improve the functionality required. However, I would suggest the team to think about looping over each and every review. This may increase the response time of the system. Perhaps more interaction with the instructors could help the team come up with a less complex solution.
noProblem The design appears to be complete.
noProblem Needs to work a bit on the plan
noProblem The explanation is descriptive and explains the logic behind the solution which is think should work. However, I believe that team should can add the explanation about the files and classes they tend to make changes in. The team can now focus on implementation of the code.
noProblem Some screenshots of actual emails sent and proposed format of the new email would be helpful
noProblem The design data includes most of the important information required to understand the teams plan.
noProblem The doc seems complete. All aspects of the problem statement are covered and test plan is also included. A UML diagram may prove to be useful.
noProblem Good job on UI and test cases. Kindly add UML diagram.
noProblem The project documentation looks complete with clear details about the purpose- to enable the students to better analyze their review based on the suggestion metrics (like volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics). They have delineated the design that includes the files that the team proposes to change (the view- app/views/response/response.html.erb and the partial app/views/submitted_content/_self_review.html.erb), the screenshot of the existing UI of the review section and how the UI would look after the project with the inclusion of a button to analyze and they have specified that a popup displaying the suggestion metrics will emerge when the button is clicked.  I specifically like how the Test plan includes their feature in the Connextra format. They have mentioned 2 scenarios- one where the student clicks the button without entering text in which case the popup alerts the reviewer saying no text for analysis and the regular scenario when the user clicks the analyze button after entering text in which case the popup displays the suggestion metrics. I wish to suggest an additional scenario where the user can intuitively test the quality of the suggestion metrics, based on the review input. Like for example, there can be test cases which show that the suggestion algorithm detects generic reviews that might be seemingly relevant to the topic but add no customization to the project being reviewed (like how some reviewers menially copy paste the same format of the review to all projects with just minor changes). Overall the team has done a great job with the documentation and I look forward to see the implementation of this project in the upcoming review.  
noProblem looks great. test plan , screenshots are all given. uml is missing but i don't think its required as the changes are in html.
noProblem The design doc is complete and clearly indicates the project objectives. The test plan indicates what aspects are to be tested and screenshots of the proposed analyze button are also posted.
noProblem The document is complete and very clear.
noProblem The design document gives details about the problem statement and gives an idea about what is to be done in the project. It specifies what files will be modified and the test plan also contains 2 scenarios mentioned. No suggestions.  
noProblem Yes, I think the document includes everything as expected.
noProblem  Yes, the wiki appears to incorporate all of the required functionality. We want students to know if they're giving helpful feedback, and we want the NLP algorithm to be local to the Expertiza project to decrease its reaction time. They have at least shown that they are going to add buttons.
noProblem I could not spot the problem statement of the proposed project in the Google doc containing the list of Problem statements. But on reading the team's design documentation on the wiki page I'm quite satisfied with the functionality that they plan to include. In addition to elucidating the main functional requirement of the project namely- the implementation of the suggestion algorithm the team has also proposed a non-functional requirement of improving the performance and response time of the time it takes to generate the suggestion through the web service.
noProblem Yes, the design document incorporates the plan to implement the functionalities as stated in the problem statement.
noProblem yes all changes are incorporated and explained well.
noProblem The design incorporates most of the functionality required. It would be nice to have a design diagram.
noProblem Yes, they have discussed about all the functionality
noProblem Yes. 
noProblem The design document incorporated all the functionalities that the project is supposed to be implementing.  No suggestions. 
noProblem I am able to understand the purpose of the project.
noProblem  Add a button to these questions to analyze them for their helpfulness. Seems clear to me.
noProblem Please add more information on the NLP algorithm team is trying to use.
noProblem The explanation is pretty good, I particularly found the images explaining what all they are going to add pretty intuitive.
noProblem changes are explained well. suggestion detection algorithm an be explained a bit more or how exactly you will be using it. probably some code snippets would help explaining that.
noProblem The authors have mentioned including 'Analyze' buttons for sentiment analysis of different parts of the comments. I think the rationale for this is very good because if they were to send all of the comments at once as input to the API, the results would be a mix of the sentiments of all the different comments and would therefore not be accurate. Also this way, I think that the response time of the system would not be affected by a whole lot.
noProblem The explanation is good and clearly indicates the project objectives.
noProblem The authors have not specified any code changes as of now so I can't comment on it. Suggestion: You might want to add any API Adapter class you plan to implement to generalize the solution for any future API implementations.  
noProblem The explanations are lucid.
noProblem The design is likely to increase the response time since API requests take time. It is essential to implement a system that keeps track of these API responses and disables this functionality when the API is unresponsive beyond and unreasonable time.
noProblem The design seems to be following DRY principle. 
noProblem The design appears to be sound, and wouldn't conflict with the existing classes or methods. 
noProblem 2 html files require change, i don't think it will affect anything.
noProblem No design has been yet proposed by the author, however i feel the author is on track to make the right changes by looking at the files intended to be modified.
noProblem Not much has been talked about the methods to be added. but the files specified seems right
noProblem I do not think that the design will increase the response time of the system. Suggestion: I did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality. That would have been useful. The test plan does mention  ViewSuggestionMetricsForReviewSegment though. If this is the method name then it does not follow snake casing. 
noProblem The authors have provided a mock-up of their final design which seems pretty good. However what's missing is UML diagrams. Something that would help understand the flow of functionality would be useful.
noProblem The screenshots posted give a clear picture of the intended output. It would be nice to have a design diagram.
noProblem It would be better to add more diagrams.
noProblem Adequate diagrams are given. Explanation of problem statement done well.
noProblem The design has pretty much covered all the functionalities in the doc.

noProblem The design has pretty much covered all the requested functionality. 
noProblem The chart is very clear.
noProblem the team has explained the implementation design/strategy in detail. the design was explained with all the required details and was very easy to understand.  
noProblem The project design has not really been expanded upon so not able to tell
noProblem The reuse of the questionaire class is smart to reduce duplication. Otherwise the minimal explanations make it hard to judge
noProblem 1. Team technically understand the change and proposed solution does not lead to adding methods in wrong classes. 2. New design should not make the code smelly. 3. Changes are logical and proposed solution is reasonable enough. No gem required. 4. It should not increase response time. 5. No, the plan is nice and should be taken forward.

noProblem The Design document states all the required things right from project design to test plan. Files that will be changed along with how functionality will work/flow are included in the doc clearly.  Suggestion: great work! no suggestions required.
noProblem The design doc is complete. All the relevant sections have been added.
noProblem Document looks complete.
noProblem The wiki explains the problem statement very well along with the proposed solution which seems reasonable. But the wiki does not include any test plans as of now. There are a few test cases which can be used to write the test plan, for eg. not adding drop deadline for the assignment itself and assigning each topic a drop deadline and check the behaviour of the system.
noProblem The design doc clearly explains the project purpose, project design and the test plan.
noProblem The document is quite comprehensive in its descriptions of the design proposal.

noProblem They have used UML diagram and flowcharts which aided in understanding their approach and the logic
noProblem Their visual aid is well designed and high quality. It helps the reader understand their total design very well.
noProblem UML diagrams are well formed. Flow charts are easy to understand. Looks like the team has thoroughly understood the problem statement. 
noProblem Yes, I believe they have included all of the required functionality. 
noProblem The design encompasses all the features in the specification. It only indicates supporting one more language, though, whereas the design document specifies any language. It seems out of the scope of the project, but what if you used the Google's Cloud Translation API to translate the static strings at run time? Then you could support almost any language. There might be licensing issues though.
noProblem Yes, The design document contains all parts of the functionality, ensuring that nothing is missed out.
noProblem Yes, it covers all the functionalities.

noProblem Screen mock up's are good. 
noProblem No clarification
noProblem The changes are much that is required just some calculated approach of the score which the author has mentioned and seems will be working
noProblem Changes are not proposed to a suitable extent as they have mostly elaborated on the problem statement. It yet remains for them to implement them and explain in explicit details their action plan to arrive at the solution.  
noProblem The design gives a proper explanation of the behavior of the system/functionality
noProblem The design looks reasonable for me.
noProblem Yes, the designs appears to be good to me. I believe the diagram shown in wiki helped me to understand their understanding

noProblem NO UML diagram is provided so cant comment.
noProblem It includes all the sections
noProblem no implementation details given, so cannot say how they 
noProblem No, their sections Solution Design is blank saying everything of importance will be be provided in the final design doc. Only good thing is that they have at least a targeted section of the code which they have planned to work upon.   
noProblem No changes proposed.
noProblem Yes, the functionality required is stated but the idea about how to code for that functionality is yet to be thought of.
noProblem I don't think they need any visual aids.

noProblem Yes, they include all the functionality in the wiki page. They can work it better if they add more details and some visual aids.
noProblem Not descriptive
noProblem The authors have provided a brief design approach of storing the URL and looping it into an email notification, so that instructor would be able to identify which review has been mapped to it. Improvisation: You can try adding information about new functions you wish to add, and if yes, which of the files identified by the mentor do you want to add the function to. This will increase the depth of your design document.
noProblem The design is rather straightforward, incorporates all the functionality required.
noProblem Have explained the project as according to the given description.
noProblem Just few high-level details (very generic) are provided which makes it hard to visualize a solution
noProblem No changes
noProblem The authors propose changes in an extremely concise manner. The idea that the team proposes to follow seems logical, but I would suggest them to include a dummy example or sample pseudocode so that the english explanantion is backed up with an idea of the code as well. Such as this-: 1) Review X is submitted 2) Loop through Review 1......n If abs(Review n score - Review X score) >= (some value) store Review n URL in list  
noProblem They did explain what they want to do. It's easy to understand and seems reasonable. They can make it more explicit and clear by making it step by step.
noProblem Not much described to rate over
noProblem The authors have explained the changes in a brief manner which are easy to understand
noProblem It looks to me from the document that the authors are clear about their implementation. Suggestion: They can elaborate more by specifying how do they intend to store the URLs to the reviews, how are they identifying the two distinctly different reviews. They can also add a basic flow of their proposed solution. This will enhance the explanation.
noProblem The explanations are brief and to the point, thought that seems to be due to the nature of the problem statement itself.
noProblem The design appears to be complete.
noProblem The new design does not talk about any methods or class definitions, thus I cannot comment on this. Suggestion: You can add more information on methods or any usage of design patterns in order to make the review effective and useful.
noProblem The new design loops through all existing reviews to compare new review scores with the original ones, and stores the URL of a specific iteration if its limit is exceeded. By waiting for all reviews to be looped in before sending email, it may increase the response time of the system.
noProblem Design document explains the entire project flow very well. The  objectives/goals are clearly stated in the doc along with the approach which team will be following in future.The  flowchart explains the functionality very well. Overall, the doc is easy to understand.  Suggestion: Team should include test plan in the doc.
noProblem The design document is well planned and does not miss any of the significant details.

noProblem only the issues/problem statement is included in the documentation as of now. The tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submissions.
noProblem The doc clearly explains the agenda of the whole project. Seems like the team still needs time to understand and devise a plan to tackle the issues identified.
noProblem Team have decided to give all details after final submission. A Design Doc should be available before starting the Project. I would recommend to provide few details on Project Design (classes involved in the project or application flow etc)
noProblem It includes all the sections
noProblem All functionalities required are in the design doc, but no content is provided.
noProblem Please add more details about the solution.
noProblem No, their sections Solution Design is blank saying everything of importance will be be provided in the final design doc. Only good thing is that they have at least a targeted section of the code which they have planned to work upon.   
noProblem Yes, the functionality required is stated but the idea about how to code for that functionality is yet to be thought of.
noProblem Team have decided to give all details after final submission. A Design Doc should be available before starting the Project. I would recommend to provide few details on Project Design (classes involved in the project or application flow etc)
noProblem only the issues/problem statement is included in the documentation as of now. The tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submissions.
noProblem Have covered almost all the issues, it would have been better if an implementation plan was provided.
noProblem Clearly defined bugs and problem statements, but no implementation details given. So it is hard to judge this criterion
noProblem Did not find much info on the Design
noProblem The team has not mentioned about how they are planning to do the changes.
noProblem Did not find much info on the Design
noProblem No plan or UML design is given.
noProblem This couldn't be reviewed as the design doc is incomplete.

noProblem The explanation given is quite easy to understand and explains the solution to the point
noProblem The authors propose two changes and have mentioned in detail about the flow in which they will make changes. They could benefit from drawing simple LoFi UI cards to illustrate how the new review page might look like which will benefit them in improving their UI design and proper representation of data before they actually spend the man hours in coding it. Overall the have explained the process in detail  and clean fashion.
noProblem The expected outcomes of the project have been clearly explained and requirements well understood.

noProblem The Design is properly designed
noProblem These changes seem to be appropriate for the objectives they have. Only a small set of files are being changed, and the functionality is isolated well. My only feedback here is that there is likely a place to create helpers or utilities for time tracking.
noProblem The authors seem to have understood the project and know what changes need to be made to what files. The changes seem to be targeted to the correct classes and preliminary investigation reveals that it does seem to follow DRY principles. They might want to make their design diagram more simplified which will not only help in making it look readable and also help in implementing the code effectively. This will help in reducing convoluted code.
noProblem The design appears to be sound considering the expected outcomes of the project and it doesn't seem that it will create any dependency mismatch as well.
noProblem they have specified the files they'll be making the changes to and it looks good
noProblem The changes provided appear to be sound.
noProblem The provided flow diagram and db table are enough the explain the functionality of the project.  
noProblem The visual aids used are precise and explain the in-depth functionality of the project. The diagrams and flowcharts ensure there is no ambiguity in the functioning of the project.
noProblem The UMl diagram mentioned her is a flow chart representing the flow of the functionality . It is designed in details  which explains the flow of the functionality quite well. 
noProblem Good use of both diagrams and tables!
noProblem visual aids are very nice, especially for the flow diagram.
noProblem The given flow-chart describes the flow of the project and how the implemented system will work
noProblem The flow diagram is good, makes understanding easier
noProblem Uml looks good, follows the convention.
noProblem Enough visual aids used to make understanding the project easier.
noProblem Document is very well written and contains all the details like problem statement, solution, files to be modified, testing plan.
noProblem It says what they will do, but it seems high level. Would appreciate some diagrams or mockups
noProblem The doc seems complete. All aspects of the problem statement are covered and test plan is also included. A use-case diagram will be useful to add.
noProblem The authors can add the project's purpose (why this feature is important/helpful). The authors have mentioned the plan to use tablesorter jQuery to sort the table but No design plan is included. I suggest the team to remove the introduction to expertiza since it was clearly mentioned in the requirements to not include it.
noProblem Design doc contains everything in clear explanation
noProblem The document mentions the tools of JQuery sorting table, in fact which API or any sample code that can be referenced to is expected in the document. Also, this project seems to focus on the view part of Expertiza, so the test plan should be more detailed, cover more edge case. 
noProblem There are no diagrams present. It would have been great if a screenshot of a test case or flow diagram was given.
noProblem Unfortunately the team has missed out on adding any visual aids to the document. I would suggest that where you list all the column names which would be sorted in each view, also add a screenshot of how that view looks at the present moment, and a low-fi sketch of how the view would look after the changes have been implemented.
noProblem The author has not used any UML diagram, nor any other forms of pictorial representation. 
noProblem Although the textual explanation is succinct and nice, there's not yet diagrams or other visual aids available. I think a diagram that depicts the workflow might be very helpful.
noProblem 1)     The team has already identified the files to be changed, which is a good thing. It looks like, all changes will be handled in the client-side, so not applicable 2)     I assume, as it is nowhere mentioned, they would be writing a custom js file, the team plans to repeat some of the custom written code, if same functionality is required in 2 different file, which could violate DRY. Team might need to consider such possibility. 3)     NO, the team is already optimizing by leverage some JavaScript libraries. 4)     It would as user opts to sort, but here it seems to be a necessary evil. 5)     Yes, the team can elaborate more on their design approach and provide visual aids to help reader understand the sorting intended better.    
noProblem The authors talk about adding the tablesorter class to the html table and using javascript scripts for further action. There are no apparent problems with this strategy, however I would suggest for the team to elaborate and provide more details on the implementation. For example, it is not possible to understand what the javascript part will look like, how many functions will be used or how they will interact with html.
noProblem Mainly needs html files to be changed and they have mentioned them which looks good 
noProblem The design proposed by the authors appears to be sound. Since this project is only to sort the views, there will be no code added to either the models or controllers. I hope the team only adds one sorting function per view and allows that one function to handle sorting for different columns in that view.
noProblem I don't think the authors plan to add methods to the wrong class. They are modifying the right files. The new design does not appear to potentially make the code "smelly". The team is using one of the existing gems in their design.
noProblem The solution looks like it doesnt add any overhead and the doesnt make the code "smelly"
noProblem The solution seems right.
noProblem I think that the authors have identified changes in the html.erb files, which looks right to me. As it only deals with the sorted view of instructor reports, the changes must go in the views part of the application.  Suggestion: You can try to add a bit of information on whether your changes include addition of new code, deletion of existing code, or just slightly modifying or extending the existing code and justify it. Query: Do you plan on creating  a drop-down like option to choose from which type of sorting is to be performed? If yes, it is an add-on user-friendly feature.
noProblem Team have shared the link for the TableSorter which explains the functionality
noProblem The explanations can be more detailed. Overall understandable.
noProblem Adequate explanation was given
noProblem It is easy to follow the changes that the authors have proposed.
noProblem Changes look good.
noProblem The design document lists every issue that is being addressed in the project, providing comprehensive details on the functionality that is required for each one.
noProblem Yes, as per the solution provided, it does seem that the design incorporates the required functionality. It considers sorting on all the specified fields. Suggestions: Since you have mentioned the use of jQuery tablesorte, you may also add explanation as to what is tablesorter and try explaining atleast for one field (e.g. name) as to how does it work to sort the entries.    
noProblem The wiki is detailed enough that it mentions all the functinoalities required in the project. The team has made sure to not miss out on any functionality and they even took out time to list the column names in each report they would add the sort feature to. Good work guys.
noProblem I think the authors have incorporated most of the functionality in the design document.
noProblem Design document contains all the functionality required.
noProblem It incorporates all the functionalites.
noProblem It includes all the sections
noProblem Except for the test plan, the design doc seems to have all the important details. The team should add a test plan before starting in order to go for a test-driven development. 
noProblem Test plan is to be added, but the purpose and the design are coherent and easy to follow.
noProblem The test plan is not yet done. Rest, I could see that the document is very much complete.
noProblem Yes the design looks complete
noProblem So far the idea is clearly articulated. Few things which are not defined are explicitly stated in the doc.
noProblem Yes, it does
noProblem Includes everything, as far as I can tell.
noProblem Yes. The design document incorporates all the functionalities stated in problem statement. 
noProblem The design has not been stated explicitly so its difficult to comment only with the flow and UML diagrams whether it is appropriate and the best way to address the issue.
noProblem Authors have a clear idea of what details need to be included to make the audience understand the purpose of the project. The design document is sufficient to get the basic idea and implementation.
noProblem The design does incorporate the functionality required of making reviews public allowing the students to toggle the visibility of review submitted. It is descriptive and easy to understand.
noProblem It's not a great explanation
noProblem Document is explained well. Also the flow of document is good. Team can add screenshots of existing documents, also some diagram to explain the solution well.
noProblem The proposed flows and project tasks are sufficiently detailed that I can understand the relationship between the issue and how they're going to solve it in each step.
noProblem The step by step instructions are detailed and is good.
noProblem The authors have explained the workflow very well with respect to the different types of users involved in the particular feature. The language is simple to follow.
noProblem The proposals given by the team are reasonable and adequately cover the features to be established during the course of the project. The changes suggested follow the desired requirements. 
noProblem The team has not addressed the project design approach and the proposed implementation details in the documentation.
noProblem 1. Authors solution do not seem to create methods to wrong classes. 2. New design code does not make the code "smelly". 3. No new gem required. Explained solution is adequate. 4. Proposed design should not hamper system performance. 5. Well efforts expended on the design  
noProblem I don't have any issues with the design, looking forward to seeing some code snippets to understand it better.
noProblem As mentioned in their Approach section, the team decided on adding some functionalities like checkboxes and views. I find these changes perfect for the problem statement given.
noProblem Implementation details haven't been added yet but that's fine as it hasn't been started yet.
noProblem The design looks fine but no explanation as to why this is done? Is it already existing or is this a new feature?
noProblem I think the UML diagram can be improved further by adding the classes that are related to the use cases separately.  
noProblem The team has done a commendable job in creating a very detailed UML diagram and explaining the case of every user very well.
noProblem No UML diagrams
noProblem Only a single UML diagram is present, but I'd have appreciated a couple of flow charts to accompany the expected flows.
noProblem They have used a USE case diagram to explain flow. I found it quite understandable and all the steps are clearly drawn out in the diagram. It clearly explains the steps required to approach a situation.
noProblem The document contains a UML Use Case Diagram that analyze the system's requirements and describes the actors involved and the relationship between them. It helps to understand the overview of the project details. However, it can certainly make use of a flow diagram in the Expected Flow section that gives more clarity about the sequence of actions. The flow diagram can follow from the use case diagram to show the tasks performed by the actors in a serial order.  
noProblem The authors have explained the changes to be made to the system, including screenshots of the tables, UML diagrams as well as all the files that will be modified. Suggestion: Although all the details are explained well in the document, by writing the changes proposed to the files in bullet points or by using a diagram the document will be easier to read.
noProblem They made clear explanation about their task. For example, their provide pictures to show what they need to do.  
noProblem  Yes, the team has elaborated their design approach and changes to system in detail. They have mentioned all the file changes and also provided sample code for reader understanding.
noProblem The design document clearly specifies all the issues that are going to be addressed by this project. UI views are provided which help the reader to better understand the scope of the requirements. Moreover, the authors list the files that are going to be modified and the authors comprehensively describe how the jQuery tablesorter 2.0 library will be used for three types of sorting. One minor improvement would be to highlight the parts associated with introduced changes that link html table with the library for better readability.
noProblem Great improvements compared to the previous submission. Now its a Very well written document. Good job team.
noProblem The team has added uml diagrams, images of related web pages and provided details on jQuery tablesorter that explains well the changes the team plans to make.
noProblem The authors have explained enough about the changes
noProblem The wiki is detailed enough that it mentions all the functionalities required in the project. The team has made sure to explain all the changes they wish to make to the system. They list all columns that need to be sorted and how they will implement the sorting.
noProblem Yes, the authors have significantly improved the writeup, and very adequately explained the changes that they've made.
noProblem The design is very efficient and follows the standardized software engineering practices. 
noProblem the design is sound and easy to understand. The design proposed also sounds logical, i.e to sort team names alphabetically, and grades numerically. To sort by both ascending and descending order.
noProblem Yes, the design seems to be sound.
noProblem The authors have justified the use of jQuery table sorter by listing its advantages.
noProblem The team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made. the design looks good and easy to implement. 
noProblem The design appears to be specific to the requirements. For this, they have used a UML design which basically explains the flow of the use-case. They have not used any principles or design patterns. However, there does not seem a need to use any, as their changes are limited to the html view and making a call to the tablesorter using JQuery. As per the document, the design does not make any redundant changes or unnecessary changes to the code. Thus, they have done a good job by optimizing the changes.
noProblem The authors have improved the part of the document that describes the interactions between html and javascript parts since the 1st round. While this assignment does not require an extensive discussion about the design principles or patterns, it would be better if the document explicitly addressed this topic.
noProblem Yes, as its sorting, not much scope on design approach. Yet the team has documented well on their approach regarding multi-level sortings that they are undertaking in few pages. They have also considered cross-browser compatibility of their jQuery library, which is a common design miss during client-side changes.
noProblem This project is not very difficult, so they don't need to follow some principles or patterns.
noProblem This their design is very simple and clear.
noProblem Yes, the design is as simple as it can be. The current scenario is explained with adequate screenshots, and the changes are explained by stating the field to be used for sorting the table. A mock-up screen of the expected output would have made it even better to understand, however reading the material is sufficient as well. The changes are not complex, as they interact with a single view at a time. The tablesorter function is also called for each view, e.g. view_submissions layout.
noProblem Yes, the design is very simple to understand, and also the implementation is pretty clear and effective.
noProblem Yes, the solution proposed is simple by using the  jQuery tablesorter gem.
noProblem The design is extremely simple and easy to understand. Good work guys :)
noProblem The screenshots of the expected result and the UML diagram are good, But the screenshots can be smaller to make the page more user-friendly. The UML diagram can be better if it's designed as a design plan diagram instead of a user diagram, which simply states how the reader is to approach this. Or it could be better if we have both.
noProblem The changes are mentioned, but not in a concise section, which I suggest would make the documentation easier to read.
noProblem the document is clear. and they added changes that have been pointed out in the previous review ..good job team!
noProblem Yes, they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection. They have given proper UML diagrams and then showcased in the "New Model", "New Controller" and "New Views" section. 
noProblem The changes to be made are clearly stated and explained
noProblem The doc explains the entire project agenda very clearly. 
noProblem The team has included all the details required to implement the given requirement. The wiki has complete details related to requirements , analysis of current designs and changes required to achieve the required functionality. overall great job !
noProblem The design is well-considered and design principles are being considered when implementing the design.
noProblem The design is the strong point and it is easily understandable, New model table idea is good
noProblem The design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the diagram and they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the Workflow and Models section so as to elucidate the problem statement.
noProblem It's good.
noProblem The design is sound with appropriate principles and patterns.
noProblem the team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made. the design looks good and easy to implement. great work done !
noProblem Yes, from a perspective of an outsider, the design seems to be simple enough, easy to understand, and efficient to implement.
noProblem Yes, the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the review section. 
noProblem The team has taken enough efforts to make it as simple as possible to explain the design
noProblem the design appears to be simple and is derived from the existing modules /designs. The workflow is easy to understand.
noProblem great visualization on existing expertiza system, I would love to see how the system is going to change after your implementation
noProblem The team has added enough diagrams to explain their design
noProblem Most of the edge cases are identified
noProblem Add screenshots. UML diagrams are very helpful when viewers walk through the design.
noProblem Yes, the authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system. Document is simple, succinct and easy to understand. Great use of flow charts, uml diagrams and mockups to visually represent the information is done. 
noProblem  Yes the author has provided a sufficient explanation of what changes needs to be done to the system by giving flow diagrams and screenshots about what changes they are going to incorporate in their system
noProblem Team has added all the diagrams and screenshots. The document is well explained and looks complete.
noProblem Yes, their explanations are adequately explained the changes.
noProblem 1) The authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system. 2) They also have given the files to be modified/added for each change.  
noProblem I think that the authors have done a really good job of explaining and covering all the changes to be made. Overall this is the best document i have seen so far.
noProblem The authors have explained all the changes to be made very clearly and concisely. Each change is supplemented with sufficient diagrams and mock-ups so as to make the final task of visualization easier.
noProblem Yes, one of the best design docs of project 4!
noProblem The document was very well written previously too, and they have improved it with diagrams and test. Nice work.
noProblem The authors have considerably improved on the document. UML diagrams as requested have been added.
noProblem The team has adequately explained all of the changes required for segregation including the exact reports and functions to be removed out of review_mapping_controller.rb along with the design pattern to be followed(strategy in this case).
noProblem Yes. Since the previous round of reviews, I can see significant and positive progress.
noProblem Well done adding a lot of detail since your last submission.
noProblem The document explains the problem and the approach the team is planning to take clearly.
noProblem The explanations are good and the project goals are easily readable.
noProblem  Refactor the report_formatter_helper into a reports_controller, where the reports_controller implements a Strategy pattern to help it figure out how it should handle a given report. If that is correct, then yes, their explanation is great!
noProblem Yes, the design follows appropriate principles and patterns. suggestions: not required.
noProblem  As the project is based upon making changes to the UI of the system , thus there is no such specific pattern being followed however the design that they have made available in the form of screenshots appear very much inclined with the functionalities that they need to implement .
noProblem Design is good
noProblem Yes, their design is very sound, and principles and patterns are used appropriately.
noProblem The project involves refactoring of the review mappings controller and the authors have proposed a clear action plan. They have added a b=very detailed testing plan and also a detailed UML diagram. The authors have updated their UML diagram and also updated their testing plan after the first submission.
noProblem 1) The design appears to be sound. 2) Also follows proper design principles eg: for making changes to nomination and review questions, inheritance is used (inheriting methods from questions parent class)
noProblem The authors have done a very good job at writing the design document. Their requirements and proposed solutions are properly aligned, and their approach takes all the factors into consideration, viz. Listing the major areas that need refactoring, Changing the code, modifying the UI, making sure that the refactoring does not affect the existing functionalities.  They have explained each of these phases with ample explanation.
noProblem The design seems to be appropriate and sound. It follows appropriate principles.
noProblem Yes, the design appears to be very sound and follows all the principles that I know. I loved the format of the documentation as well.
noProblem They have explained very well
noProblem The document enlisted the crucial aspects of the project in the first stage. The team has made improvements in this stage by including a test plan section that lists the set of test cases to deal with the retrieval issue and plan on including a new controller for the next stages. 
noProblem The team has adequately explained all of the changes required for segregation including the exact reports and functions to be removed out of review_mapping_controller.rb along with the design pattern to be followed(strategy in this case).
noProblem Yes the design follows simple rails concepts and is pretty straightforward. I would like to see if the team uses existing gems available to speed up implementation and re use.   
noProblem Yes, looks clean. Any design patterns used????
noProblem Yes. Since the previous round of reviews, I can see significant and positive progress.
noProblem Yes, the design appears to be sound and well made. 
noProblem Yes, the plan is clear and easy to read.
noProblem Well done adding a lot of detail since your last submission.
noProblem Have Updated the test plan.Good job!
noProblem Yes, the design appears to be sound. There could be some rearrangement in the mock-up layout, e.g. text box for email address and 'Add' button could have the same horizontal alignment for a better user interface.
noProblem The document explains the problem and the approach the team is planning to take clearly.
noProblem The design looks clear and complete and is using a strategy pattern for implementation.
noProblem The design seems to be very simple. I think the team has avoided unnecessary complications and are doing minimal changes to existing system to solve issues given to them.
noProblem The explanations are good and the project goals are easily readable.
noProblem The design approach seems justified and inline with the functionalities required to be implemented. They have mentioned step wise details for all the changes they are going to take. Done a good job. No rework required.
noProblem They have used the design patterns well, and made a good choice in explaining the class hierarchy with the class diagram (however, I'm not quite sure whether it's right to call the diagram as a UML diagram)
noProblem design looks well thought out.
noProblem  Refactor the report_formatter_helper into a reports_controller, where the reports_controller implements a Strategy pattern to help it figure out how it should handle a given report. If that is correct, then yes, their explanation is great!
noProblem  Yes the design is presented in a much simpler form which gives a very clear picture of how the changes are going to be implemented and which functionalities would be witnessing the changes , also as they have provide the screenshots it enhances the understanding about the project more.
noProblem Good design principles are being used for this project.
noProblem Yes, their design is simple and clear enough to read and understand.
noProblem Refactor functionality from a Controller helper into its own Controller where that Controller will implement the Strategy pattern. It seems sounds to me!

Their requirements and proposed solutions are properly aligned, and their approach takes all the factors into consideration, viz. Listing the major areas that need refactoring, Changing the code, modifying the UI, making sure that the refactoring does not affect the existing functionalities.  They have explained each of these phases with ample explanation.
noProblem The authors have understood the requirements of each report generation clearly. They have converted report generation into a single step by providing a drop-down menu for 8 reports. For this, they have used generateReport() method. The design uses a strategy pattern to generate a particular type of report. The sub classes (strategy classes) use only required subset of class variables, and it seems as an efficient design. The strategy pattern is a good example of DRY principle.

noProblem The team has done tremendous job in the test plan they have already implemented the test cases and given the path to run it.
noProblem The provided tests are in depth and will test the changes made thoroughly.
noProblem The provided tests are in depth and will test the changes made thoroughly.
noProblem They have pretty good test plan as there is no code yet.
noProblem They have pretty good test plan as there is no code yet.
noProblem This is a mozilla project and I am not sure what are the testing requirements and depth to be covered, as it is not mentioned in the document. But the steps mentioned do suggest that basic testing id done
noProblem It included a proper test plan. There was no test plan included in the previous version of the design document but authors have added it in the second round which made the design document complete.
noProblem the design does include test plan and plans to test the functionalities 
noProblem The team have thoroughly explained the changes that need to be made and how they intend to make those changes. The team could explain their test plan in more detail.
noProblem The additions made to the explanations were excellent. The detail of which changes affect which files is very good.
noProblem They explain their changes succinctly and in an easy to follow manner, and they explain the motivation for the changes well.
noProblem Yes, they explained the changes in a great detail. They also wrote a part called "Implement Steps" which includes 5 tasks. Good job!
noProblem the design does include test plan and plans to test the functionalities 
noProblem The authors have explained the required changes in a concise manner.
noProblem Yes, the project design is meaningful and clear. The solution is well laid out.
noProblem Changes are explained but are not very descriptive. The document is not much changed since the last submission
noProblem Yes. 
noProblem Yes, the authors have specified the changes to be made in the system under the proposed project design. The changes have been included as sub heading with sub points under each. The authors have also included a relevant files heading that includes the files where changes are made.The changes involve allowing the instructor to change language for a course. In the process a separate language column will be added to the Courses table and a dropdown of languages in the Edit Courses page where a language can be chosen. Once the instructor updates the Edit Course page with the chosen language, the static strings in the Expertiza application will be changed to the chosen language. For adding multi-language support, Google Translate and Rails Internationalization API is being used. Also, two yaml files- en.yml and hi_EN.yml contains the translated strings for the respective languages. The routes.rb file and all the view files will be correspondingly modified to show the different languages after reading from the yaml files. 
noProblem The explanations provided by the authors seems to be good. They have referred the Rails Internationalization API guide which provides sufficient explanation for multi language support. They have mentioned the different elements that will be changed and how an instructor would proceed to change the language of the course verbally. In addition they have also added mock-ups to visually represent this information.
noProblem The explainations are succinct. The description in technical design section and before-after images clearly shows what the project intends to do.
noProblem The changes are clearly mentioned , they are very clear what and where to make changes. Only suggestion would be to include more about how these changes are going to be done. 
noProblem Adding a languages column to the Courses table makes sense and so does leveraging third-party APIs to handle the translation.
noProblem The design is as required, following the appropriate patterns.
noProblem As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.
noProblem It is sound.
noProblem Looking at the design there seems to be high use of cohesion  and low coupling. It's good that all the changes are restricted to the routes.rb and config/locales files so that the resulting changes won't be messy and ruin the rest of the system. Also this helps in refactoring if needed in the future as there will be limited number of files to be changed.
noProblem Yes, the design appears to be as simple as possible. The team has mentioned what needs to be done and how they plan to implement it.
noProblem Yes, simple straightforward solution.  
noProblem The changes have been explained well enough to minimize the complexity. The implementation seems extremely clear.
noProblem Simple and easy to understand steps.
noProblem The team has mentioned properly what changes they are doing and how they will be doing them. In the first submission they had suggested the possible approaches. Now, they are having a concrete way they are implementing these changes.
noProblem Yes, and at times, much more than necessary! 
noProblem Yes. Only view files are involving since this topic is about changing the language.
noProblem Yes. The authors have made changes to the design document and are more specific about how exactly they plan to implement the new functionality.
noProblem Yes, they explained a lot for the changes. Great job!
noProblem The design appears to be very simple. The team has avoided unnecessary complications by adhereing to the Rails Internationalization guide. They have also avoided making unnecessary changes to many files and kept the changes to the minimum number of files required.
noProblem The team added more information from the last time which aided in a better explanation of the problem. Good job team
noProblem 1) The authors have adequately explained the changes to be made to the design document.
noProblem The design is really crisp and easy to understand. One can clearly understand the problem statement and the proposed solution for the same. The design document is properly structured as well.
noProblem The explanations are more than sufficient. Not only have the authors explained the changes to the system, but also explained the reasoning for considering those changes. I like the way that they also explained the other different ways they could've integrated the GitHub metrics but avoided those methods with sufficient reasoning for the same.The team has also given an explanation of their database design modifications would be like which is good.
noProblem Yes the current design looks simple and wholesome. Seems they have done a good job in implementing understanding how rails internationalization works. Good job   
noProblem Yes , excellent work done by the team. The design document adequately explains what is the problem that they are trying to solve, what is the proposed solution and how the solution would look like.  There are enough details to in the document to understand what is being done and what changes are proposed. The document also has enough illustrations on what is the current situation.

noProblem The necessary visual inputs to aid explanation are present.
noProblem mock UIs screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required changes.
noProblem I don't see any issue in the design document. They have followed a good design principle.
noProblem No visualization or diagrams are necessary.
noProblem 1) The authors have mentioned several approaches in which these functionalities could be implemented. 2) Their chosen approach is follows MVC architecture and DRY principles.
noProblem  The design sound very reasonable.
noProblem The design is concise and clear. They have added reference images of how the system would look after their changes, which properly shows the expected implementation results.
noProblem Yes. It is thoroughly investigated.
noProblem Yes
noProblem Their design is much simple and clear, also easy to understand.
noProblem Yeah, I believe it is as simple as possible while choosing the best path for the expertiza project to grow, but it still sounds like a very ambitious project for 1 group to complete.
noProblem With proper documentation, the problem is explained nicely and understanding of the complex problem is made easier.
noProblem 1) Have clearly mentioned when will GitHub Api be hit to retrive the data and which gem will be used.
noProblem  Their design is simple and clear.
noProblem The use case diagram properly shows how the addition of this feature will help for the instructor role.

noProblem excellent use of screenshots, made things very clear for me.
noProblem The test plan is compatible with the problem statement. 
noProblem Yes, they use a lot of diagrams to show use case.
noProblem As there are UI changes test plan is not required but a basic stepwise description of how to see the required output can be helpful
noProblem Test plan have been shown clearly and tests are easy to understand.
noProblem Yup, because it only tests the ability to change the language.
noProblem Explains the different approaches with the help of use case diagram.
noProblem There are enough aids such as uml diagrams and screen shots. The authors explicitly mention that there are no db changes so no need of an er diagram. Although I would have liked some class level details to be mentioned in the document that would help to dig more about the design changes
noProblem  They not only use use case diagram but also mock-up screenshot to help the reader understand their design.
noProblem The test plan briefly mentions the scenarios the team plans to test. They can add more about the test cases if possible.
noProblem The test plan seems adequate at this stage, edge cases may need to be considered at a later stage.
noProblem No
noProblem Yes, it includes the test plan with a great detail.
noProblem  The test plan seems adequate enough to show that they understand what to test.
noProblem Few test plan is written. The team can add more test plan.
noProblem  Test plans for both of their subtasks were present.

noProblem The document was very well written previously too, and they have improved it with diagrams and test. Nice work.
noProblem The authors have considerably improved on the document. UML diagrams as requested have been added.
noProblem Yes, the design follows appropriate principles and patterns. suggestions: not required.
noProblem  As the project is based upon making changes to the UI of the system , thus there is no such specific pattern being followed however the design that they have made available in the form of screenshots appear very much inclined with the functionalities that they need to implement .
noProblem Design is good
noProblem Yes, their design is very sound, and principles and patterns are used appropriately.
noProblem 1) The design appears to be sound. 2) Also follows proper design principles eg: for making changes to nomination and review questions, inheritance is used (inheriting methods from questions parent class)
noProblem They have explained very well
noProblem Yes the design follows simple rails concepts and is pretty straightforward. I would like to see if the team uses existing gems available to speed up implementation and re use.   
noProblem Yes, looks clean. Any design patterns used????
noProblem Yes, the design appears to be sound and well made. 
noProblem Yes, the design appears to be sound. There could be some rearrangement in the mock-up layout, e.g. text box for email address and 'Add' button could have the same horizontal alignment for a better user interface.
noProblem The design seems to be very simple. I think the team has avoided unnecessary complications and are doing minimal changes to existing system to solve issues given to them.
noProblem The design approach seems justified and inline with the functionalities required to be implemented. They have mentioned step wise details for all the changes they are going to take. Done a good job. No rework required.

noProblem  The design document includes flow charts, UML diagrams and screenshots which is really impressive as it made the document easier to understand.
noProblem The design appears to be simple.
noProblem I loved the overall use of the visualizations which aids to the understanding of the whole doc. The formatting of the documentation makes it really easy to read and understand.
noProblem A suggestion would be to add some visualization about what the offscreenCanvas does would be helpful.
noProblem Since it is a Mozilla project testing is not necessary, but the previous design documentation does touch upon the specifics of testing how an OffScreenCanvas is rendered.
noProblem Yes the presence of use case diagrams and flow charts explaining the work flow is good. It would be nice if there were more uml diagrams such as sequence so show various class interactions.  Presence of mockup screens is good. That helps in understanding what is being implemented. It would have been good if the authors put in more details about the validations that that propose in the system 
noProblem Yes, the uml diagrams sufficiently provide visualization.
noProblem The authors have added UML diagrams as requested in the previous review and it has made a lot of difference. The explanation is much clearer now.

They have already included the tests they are writing for the functionality implementation. They have covered the exhaustive scenarios  for the project in their test. Their test plan is highly appreciative.
noProblem  The test plan is quite good as it covers all the test cases in the form of 11 test cases which test all the functionalities for the admin and the instructor role. It also considers the negative test cases like throwing an exception when the pending instructor tries to add more then 10 students to his/her course.
noProblem Tests can be made more exhaustive. For now it looks like only the view will be tested but controller should be tested as well.
noProblem Yes, they include the test plan.
noProblem 1) The test cases cover all of the functionalities that they are going to implement.
noProblem Yes, the document includes a test plan. There was no test plan present in the previous version of the design document but the team included the test plan in the second round. The test plan is clear and seems like it would really test the functionalities.

noProblem The authors have described 1-2 solutions of the problem. However, I would suggest them to include more about how these changes will be done and where are these changes going to occur, what files will be affected etc.
noProblem All problem statements have been explained, this time including an elaborate test plan.
noProblem Yes, the author explained the plan clearly. The steps and the files need to be modified are listed.
noProblem As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.
noProblem Yes it looks sound
noProblem The  design is sound. It completely follows the instructions. It also has detailed implemenation plan in each steps. I think it follows the DRY principle, because it uses existing implementations, fully understood the existing implementations, and added the functions above. I think it should also follow the factory pattern, although not shown in the design doc.

noProblem The design is very efficient and follows the standardized software engineering practices. 
noProblem The design is sound because it has plans of file modification, of implemented solution, and very detailed testing plan. The DRY principle might not be well followed, since in each testing, the tester needs to log in as a super_administrator2 again. And there are five testings. 
noProblem the design is sound and easy to understand. The design proposed also sounds logical, i.e to sort team names alphabetically, and grades numerically. To sort by both ascending and descending order.
noProblem Yes, the design seems to be sound.
noProblem The authors have justified the use of jQuery table sorter by listing its advantages.
noProblem The team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made. the design looks good and easy to implement. 
noProblem The design appears to be specific to the requirements. For this, they have used a UML design which basically explains the flow of the use-case. They have not used any principles or design patterns. However, there does not seem a need to use any, as their changes are limited to the html view and making a call to the tablesorter using JQuery. As per the document, the design does not make any redundant changes or unnecessary changes to the code. Thus, they have done a good job by optimizing the changes.
noProblem Yes, as its sorting, not much scope on design approach. Yet the team has documented well on their approach regarding multi-level sortings that they are undertaking in few pages. They have also considered cross-browser compatibility of their jQuery library, which is a common design miss during client-side changes.
noProblem This project is not very difficult, so they don't need to follow some principles or patterns.
noProblem Yes, the design is very simple to understand, and also the implementation is pretty clear and effective.
noProblem The design is extremely simple and easy to understand. Good work guys :)
noProblem Yes, the solution proposed is simple by using the  jQuery tablesorter gem.
noProblem The use of jQuery plugin sounds simple and easy to use.
noProblem The design looks simple and clear.
noProblem This their design is very simple and clear.
noProblem This part has been significantly improved from the previous submission. The diagram make it very easy for an outsider to understand the architecture, the underlying problems and the proposed solution. 
noProblem Yes. The figures added to the wiki clearly indicate the changes that will be made to each view. The columns that will be made sortable and how will the made sortable. Good work :)
noProblem Yes, the team added visual aids like UML diagrams, screen shots, code snippets to clearly describe the changes to be made to the system. Well done!
noProblem This team used great diagrams that add to their documentation's clarity significantly.
noProblem There are multiple visual elements that improve the readability of the document. Screenshots of the UI tables help with the illustration of the required changes. Furthermore, the UML diagram demonstrates the relation between relevant flows.
noProblem The team has added good number of mock UIs and UML diagram and clearly explains the code follow. All of them are self-explanatory and needs no improvement
noProblem diagram is added. 
noProblem No visulization is necessary for this project
noProblem You have a lot of testing scenarios which is really good
noProblem The design doc includes the test plan which covers all the changes that will be made.
noProblem There is a detail explanation on how the function testing will be carried out under the teating plan section of the wiki doc.
noProblem Yes it includes test plan. It is very well written and will test the functionalities.
noProblem Test plans looks to be an overview of the functionality, In the test plan i see the functionalities explained l
noProblem The test plan is complete and covers all intended functionalities. They have also provided all necessary steps to test the functionality. Good documentation on test plan. As client-side changes using script is added, a latency test to verify system is not slow in responding to sorting can be included.
noProblem the test plan is thorough. 
noProblem Yes. The authors do have an adequate explanation. 
noProblem they have also added the UML diagrams which makes things a lot more clearer
noProblem The authors have very well explained all the changes that need to be done with the help of proper problem statement, the files that require modifications, the current and the required state.
noProblem Good additions on the purpose and use case of your work.
noProblem Is decently explained
noProblem Team has explain the changes to be made very well. Also screenshots of the system is helping to understand which part of system is changing.
noProblem The Introduction and Proposed Solution sections appropriately describes the problem and the approach to resolve the issue. The changes proposed can be concisely implemented into the system. They have enlisted use case diagrams for the entire scenario to be added to the rubrics.
noProblem I cannot remember what the explanation looked like last week, but the read through this week felt very clear. The organization of the article felt like it followed the logic of a design project. The problem statement felt like it was reduced to a clear, concise, set of requirements that are attainable. The addition of the program flow diagram and an explanation as to why there is no UML diagram also helped to cement my understanding and set my expectations.
noProblem Good work on adding UML diagrams. Now the problem is very well explained.
noProblem Yes, they have given a good, detailed explanation of the planned changes.
noProblem Yes, they include all the details in the functionality implementation.
noProblem The authors have mentioned about the changes
noProblem Yes, clear and crisp.
noProblem The authors have thoroughly explained the changes made to the system.
noProblem The authors have lucidly explained the changes that are to be made to the system. They show the current state of the system and the expected state which includes a new button to Analyze the review content in the segmented text box. The authors have specified 2 files that they plan to modify namely the view file response.html.erb and a partial _self_review.html.erb. The team clearly show the format of the response popup with suggestion metrics that capture sentiment score, sentiment tone, whether suggestions are present or not, chance of suggestions, volume of text and the volume of text without stop words. They also propose to improve the response time of extracting the output from the API.One suggestion is that the team could have touched upon the working of the suggestion detection algorithm though it is not part of their current implementation. They do mention that it is a black box and have included a link to the deployed NLP project for suggestion algorithm, where users can test the suggestion metrics generated for custom text.
noProblem yes they have explained it very well.
noProblem The changes proposed are well explained and clearly indicate the intended output.
noProblem The authors have adequately explained changes made to the system. They have explained the problem and proposed solution clearly and supported it with appopriate diagrams.
noProblem Very detailed and precise. Solution explained thoroughly. 
noProblem The desgn looks okay
noProblem The design appears sound.
noProblem Yes, it seems very sound and workable.
noProblem The design appears to be sound, they are checking if its multiple round exists and adding the checkbox functionality.
noProblem The design is clear and easy to interpret. The team has provided a code snippet which explains the changes to be made in the system to implement the solution.
noProblem The design lacked enough explanation about how will they deal with reviews when the box is  checked and unchecked. For the naming of the function and database, the name seems too long. It is better to make the name shorter and easy to understand.
noProblem Basic complexity
noProblem Looks simple
noProblem Design doc shows a good amount of work to be done. Team has articulated changes to be made well that makes design doc simple to understand.
noProblem The design is seems to be as simple as possible.
noProblem Yes. According to what they wrote, they are going to realize this project from 2 sides, the instructor side and the student side. The steps are very clear.
noProblem The design appears to be simple and easily understandable
noProblem Yes, simple and straightforward.
noProblem The design has been made as simple as possible. The complexity of the design is simplified using flow charts.
noProblem This is a fairly simple design.
noProblem Yes a variety of apt visual aid has been used like screenshots, UML diagram etc
noProblem The team has used flowcharts and UI which was necessary for this project.
noProblem The diagram in UI part states clearly the changes the authors intend to make and how it will be like. The flow diagram explains clearly the design logic and help me understand what changes the team will make.
noProblem The team has used mock-ups and a flowchart to show the basic functionality.
noProblem Tests with different scenarios are provided.
noProblem Yes. According to what they wrote, they are going to realize this project from 2 sides, the instructor side and the student side. The steps are very clear.
noProblem The team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made. the design looks good and easy to implement.
noProblem The authors have included an elaborate test plan which tests even the functionality they have missed to mention in the proposed design part of the document. This is quite complete.
noProblem The design seems to be clear such that it provides the implementation procedure to be followed to include the feature of adding student generated questions to the rubrics.
noProblem They explained from their requirements and in their flow, that they only need to plan to edit the View, so there is no need for a UML.
noProblem The design is sound.
noProblem As per the documentation, the design seems simple.
noProblem Looks very doable
noProblem Yes from the diagrams I could say, design and design flow is simple enough and team has well understood the changes to be made.
noProblem Yes, the design is sound and clear. Majority of the work is done by the suggestion algorithm. The team proposes to integrate this functionality into Expertiza and also improve the response time. This project does not need to incorporate any design pattern as only the view files are altered. The project does not impact the degree to which it is object oriented.
noProblem Since the task is to integrate a web service in the existing system, the design mentioned is sound and reasonably primitive. 
noProblem yes it does based on the proposed solution.
noProblem The design is good. However, there is no scope of using bad principles since the number of files that will be affected are minimal and restricted to just 2.
noProblem The design doc is sound and I believe no design patterns are required for this project.
noProblem The design appears sound.
noProblem Yes, the design in its current form seems straight forward.
noProblem The Requirements were distilled down to the fewest simple terms possible without over-generalization. It felt like they just gave me the tl;dr statement without any fluffy words to waste my time, and also feels like they have a strong grasp over what they are expected to accomplish.
noProblem Yes, the design appears to be simple. 
noProblem Yes, the design appears to be very simple
noProblem Yes, the design is very simple and easy to follow.
noProblem The design appears to be simple and straightforward to implement. The team has also included all the files that will be changed to achieve the desired results
noProblem The design appears simple to be executed based on the procedure specified and the list of diagrams given that it justifies the implementation to be carried out.
noProblem Yes the design is simple and illustrated well with the use of wireframes showing the current, expected state and UML diagram showing the flow diagram. It depicts that once the Analyze button is clicked, the request is sent as JSON which contains the text typed by reviewer in the segmented textbox to the API which generates the suggestion metrics. The response contains the suggestion metrics like sentiment score, sentiment tone, presence of suggestions, chance of suggestion, total volume of text and volume of text without stop words. 
noProblem Yes, the design is simple and clear. The task is to integrate a web service which returns a result in JSON format.
noProblem The diagram is clear and easy to understand, from the diagram, the design may be easy and clear to implement. More details should be provided to evaluate further about the complexity.
noProblem yes it does appear to be simple as possible.
noProblem The design is simple and easy to understand. Could be better if implementing some code level design.
noProblem The design is as simple as it could be since the flow of logic is pretty linear and there is no scope of complexity. The changes also seems to be restricted to just one file which is good and in keeping with sound principles.
noProblem It would be better if UML and Class diagram are added as a part of the documentation.
noProblem Team has provided good amount of use case diagrams, which actually are heart of the whole design doc and explains the design and approach well.
noProblem They have made some UML diagrams which could describe the changes.
noProblem Yes, they use a lot of charts to explain the use cases. Great job!
noProblem The use case diagrams provided to describe the role of each user through the flow and specify how each case maps to another in order for the desired functionality to be achieved.
noProblem The diagram is logistic and it's easily to tell the logic behind the changes. By reading these diagrams, I can get an understanding of this project quickly.
noProblem Yes, the flow charts are complete and readable. All cases are included.
noProblem The design appears very simple.
noProblem The project does not necessarily need diagramatic explanations but UML diagrams have been used which show implementation plan fairly well.
noProblem the screenshots of the Expertiza system are very helpful in understanding the problem and the solution
noProblem The Flow diagram mentioned in the document clearly explains the changes need to be done.
noProblem The author has excellently explained about the changes that they would be making by providing the design diagram and the screenshot of the the changes that they have incorporated .Also they have mentioned about their choice of tool which is google chart and why do they prefer , so overall a good explanation
noProblem Changes that's needs to be made has been explained correctly.
noProblem Yes, their doc has adequately explained the changes.
noProblem The team have a well written design document and and the authors have explained the proposed changes well. The authors have also listed each file they are going to be changed.
noProblem yes, the team has well explained the changes that they are going to make. Last time it was a bit confusing but this time because of the help of the diagrams and mock UI screen, the solution seems clear now.
noProblem The authors have explained the changes made to the system. The design flow greatly helps to understand the flow of the system.
noProblem Yes, this team has made the best use of visualization tools that can be applied to their project. They have clearly shown wireframes of the current response page juxtaposed with the expected state with the Analyze button next to each rubric. The document also includes the flow of the project represented as UML diagram. Once the Analyze button is clicked the request text is sent to the suggestion detection algorithm. The API returns the response which contains the suggestion metrics like sentiment score, sentiment tone, presence of suggestions, chance of suggestion, total volume of text and volume of text without stop words. 
noProblem The authors have described what all changes they plan to do and where they plan to do it. Compared to the previous version of the design document they have now included what tools and framework they plan to work on. The design document looks complete and understandable now.
noProblem They will be changing mostly html and erb code to create a visual interface that delivers information to instructors more effectively.
noProblem The proposed changes have been explained in a simple manner.
noProblem The use of visualization is not pivotal for this task as it can be explained theoretically as well. But still, the team has made an effort to present the task with help of a flow diagram.
noProblem yes, very well explained.
noProblem The document adequately describes the project description and proposals made. The proposed change of generating a single or single bar chart graph based on the categories selected to display the chart, can be efficiently made to the system.
noProblem They have improved the document to provide a better description of changes to be made to the system.
noProblem The screenshots clearly display where the output would be displayed.
noProblem Yes the design is sound and gives a proper explanation about how their implementation would behave.
noProblem Design seems correct.
noProblem Yes, their design is clear and sound, and the principles and patterns are well used.
noProblem yeah their design seems to be sound and neat.
noProblem System is well defined 
noProblem The UML diagrams clearly descibes the design of the solution. The screenshots explain changes required in the system adequately.
noProblem The design document is good and I don't think any design pattern needs to be followed as very few changes are being made. 
noProblem The design makes use of the Google charts tool to generate visual charts for specific criteria set. Based on the design flow, it appears that the functionality can be consistently performed to generate the visual graph for the instructor.
noProblem Yes, the design appears to be sound and uses appropriate design principles.
noProblem Yes the design is pretty simple and inclusion of screenshot enhances the clarity of what the team has achieved in terms of the required changes. 
noProblem Design is simple and easy to understand.
noProblem Yes UML diagram is provided and it is detailed. Flow diagrams explains how suggestions will be given. 
noProblem Yes, the design is simple and easy to understand. I can easily know what they will do through their doc.
noProblem The design appears to be very simple and well written. They have explained the use case diagram very well. also they have added visualizations.
noProblem yes, the design is simple and easy to understand 
noProblem The team is using external tools to do the work and its clear and easy
noProblem The document is really simple to understand once you get to understand the flow. However, initially it appears to be difficult.
noProblem I think more tests can be added
noProblem From the reasons provided for choosing the Google charts tool, and it's effectiveness, it can be integrated into the system functionality easily making the design simpler to be executed.
noProblem Yes, design involves google charts API and seems very simple.
noProblem Yes the design flow and the screenshots very clearly describes the changes made to the system.
noProblem Flow diagram explains the flow correctly.
noProblem Yes, they have used visualization to help people understand their design.
noProblem They have worked on their weak point. Earlier their solution does not seem cogent but I would say now they have made good progress.
noProblem The sample data visualizations is good. The way they have given visualizations for sample data is nice. easier to understand and good.
noProblem The use cases appear to offer a quality, general test approach to see if their design does what it should.
noProblem Test cases have been added. 
noProblem The team already has mockups for their design.
noProblem The visualization is great, the screenshots clearly indicate the proposed output of the project.
noProblem Really good visualization provided.
noProblem The project does not have any testing involved as such. But the authors have added a testing plan.
noProblem According to the team "The specification of the project does not require us to use automated tests" but they plan to test the modified ruby code or the new features using the RSpec testing framework. Overall, the test  plan sounds good 
noProblem No tests are required for the project as stated
noProblem This team did not require any tests.
noProblem The test plan section specifies that it does not require performing any automated tests. However, since the new functionality of adding a visual diagram, the team would modified ruby code for the functions added to the grades_controller.
noProblem The test plan is complete. The team plans to test the two possible cases:1. When the review is blank. Response should be no review in text box.2. When review is present response is the result of suggestion metrics analysis. The team is right in testing just these two cases because they should not test if the API itself is returning a correct response as that would be against testing rules.
noProblem Yes. Functional tests with scenarios provided.
noProblem The design doc includes the test plan which covers changes in the functionalities.
noProblem Yes, the issues and the proposed solutions are clearly written.
noProblem Yes they have
noProblem Yes, this is the best design I have reviewed. It has clearly explained the changes in steps. the formatting is great, and it's very well made with very good design details and objectives. It also included the current scenario and a typical score table. It should be great if there's an expected final outcome visualization as well.
noProblem Yes the authors have adequately described the changes required to be made to the system. The process has been divided into steps and each step describes changes in the MVC files. Good job
noProblem The problem and the changes needed is explained clearly
noProblem Yes. The design is clear and the details are succinct.
noProblem The design looks simplified but there might be some edge cases that needs handling such as - What if a student makes his/her review public, this review is selected by the power user to create a sample and then the student wishes to make the review private?
noProblem Yes the approach is explained in detail.
noProblem The design is proper.
noProblem It is simple enough and also achieves the required features
noProblem The UML diagram is very good and makes understanding very easy
noProblem Yes the test plan section is again detailed with step by step instruction
noProblem Team has explained the problem statement, approach to solve the issue well. Also the use case diagram explains design well.
noProblem Design doc is not complex and every section of the menu explains the itself with simplest term possible.
noProblem Very basic explanation
noProblem Simple design
noProblem   The team has well explained the changes which are required to be made in the system. They have broken the explanation of the details of the requirement in simple bullet points which makes it very easy to understand the change requested. The design approach 
noProblem The steps taken by the team to implement the functionality is very clear and detailed. as stated above, the approach discusses the  step wise action that the team is going to take for the implementation.
noProblem The team has come up with a very detailed and clear step wise test plan for all the actors involved. They have done great work to depict the flow for every user which makes sure they are handling all the scenarios. This also suggests their approach is behavior driven. They have done great job in this and the test are in depth.
noProblem While I'm awaiting to receive the details which are pending on the implementation, I feel the general nature of the changes is well-explained. 
noProblem Confronted with a tricky problem in creating links between different assignments across semesters to aggregate the reviews, I was really impressed with the way they plan to accomplish this feature.
noProblem I like the Use Case Diagram, but I would like class diagrams or a database visualization too, so it's easier to understand how the cross-course assignment linking will work.
noProblem Detailed test plan (+1)
noProblem The authors have adequately mentioned the desired changes in the approach and design section. The problem statement gives the gist of the issue at hand including adding feature to make student's reviews public. The proposals specified are effective to deal with the issue by creating a new MVC framework.
noProblem The design and fixes are coherently described and are logical to be implemented for the given functionality. The issues are stated properly allowing the reader to understand it and the fixes suggested are enlisted in an appropriate manner.
noProblem The design makes it clear to understand the procedure adapted to realize the goal. The authors have made it a point to describe the tasks carried out in a simpler manner allowing the reader to realize the approach towards the issue. 
noProblem The UML Use Case diagram takes into consideration the system specifications and the manner in which the users interact with each other in the process. It makes it easy to analyze how the implementation can take place in the current scenario. 
noProblem The test plan section properly describes the flow that needs to be followed by each actor involved in the process. This could be enhanced either by providing a flow diagram or adding certain test case snippets for the scenarios.
noProblem The design seems pretty simple and straightforward. 
noProblem Yes based on the explanation given, the design seems appropriate and will achieve the desired end-results. Good Job !
noProblem The design is concised and clear. Only makes the required changes and introduces no duplications.
noProblem Yes, they explained a lot with two steps.
noProblem I really loved the way that the authors have provided a detailed proposed plan section making it very clear about the changes that are required to be made in order to tackle the given problem statement.
noProblem All problem statements have been explained, this time including an elaborate test plan.
noProblem Yes, the author explained the plan clearly. The steps and the files need to be modified are listed.
noProblem As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.
noProblem Yes it looks sound
noProblem The  design is sound. It completely follows the instructions. It also has detailed implemenation plan in each steps. I think it follows the DRY principle, because it uses existing implementations, fully understood the existing implementations, and added the functions above. I think it should also follow the factory pattern, although not shown in the design doc.
noProblem Yes the system is well designed and the UI looks neat as well. They have put effort into the UI thinking process.
noProblem Although the design provided is clear, there might be some more work needed to optimize it properly and make it work as intended. 
noProblem The design appears to be sound and seems to follow all the appropriate principles as far as I am concerned. And as mentioned earlier I would again like to point out that the proposed plan section has been handled really well.
noProblem The document is very well structured and is quite easy to follow. They have explained each and everything stepwise.
noProblem Yes, the design seems appropriate and suitable for the case. Maybe the author could specify the patterns they use in the document.
noProblem Yes, simple straightforward solutions.
noProblem the design is simple
noProblem The design is both simple and clear. It should be better to add another step for the comparison of the instructor review and the student review. Both as a final examination and a testing.
noProblem Yes the design is as simple as possible. However they have only described the proposed design. They could have provided simple mock ups or samples,
noProblem Yes, pretty simple. Great job!
noProblem The design appears to be simple to the best of my knowledge. Not a lot of files needed to be changed, signifying that they are just targeting specific files in order to make minimum number of changes possible not making it too complex.
noProblem The document is well explained. Thus, it reduces complexity and makes itself appear quite easy for the user to understand. However, more diagrams and flowcharts would have helped even more.
noProblem The design is as simple as possible, and described in a straightforward manner.
noProblem The design seems simple and feasible.
noProblem Necessary visual inputs are present to aid explanation.
noProblem Yes, appropriate visual cue is present in the form of screen shots
noProblem There are visual aids included with the design, depicting the current state of the system as well as proposed icons to institute the design changes.
noProblem The authors provide some screenshots which make their project more clear. It would be better if they provide more diagrams to explain their solutions.
noProblem I see test cases properly defined, but the test plan is missing.
noProblem Yes the test plan is included.I think the tests will cover all scenarios
noProblem The testing appears to be pretty rigorous. They have taken into account cases when TA/instructor's scores should be excluded. The test cases could have been better described.
noProblem Team has done a good job in identifying the cases that needs to be tested. It will be an improvement if they can add details on how they plan to test each controller/view separately.
noProblem Yes, there is a detailed test plan for this project. Not only basic features testing but also other more testing.
noProblem The test plan looks really thorough covering all the possible scenarios. I am personally happy with the given test-plan.
noProblem Yes, the authors have significantly improved the writeup, and very adequately explained the changes that they've made.
noProblem The authors have explained the changes to be made to the system, including screenshots of the tables, UML diagrams as well as all the files that will be modified. Suggestion: Although all the details are explained well in the document, by writing the changes proposed to the files in bullet points or by using a diagram the document will be easier to read.
noProblem The authors have explained enough about the changes
noProblem The team has added uml diagrams, images of related web pages and provided details on jQuery tablesorter that explains well the changes the team plans to make.
noProblem Great improvements compared to the previous submission. Now its a Very well written document. Good job team.
noProblem  Yes, the team has elaborated their design approach and changes to system in detail. They have mentioned all the file changes and also provided sample code for reader understanding.
noProblem They made clear explanation about their task. For example, their provide pictures to show what they need to do.  
noProblem The design is very efficient and follows the standardized software engineering practices. 
noProblem the design is sound and easy to understand. The design proposed also sounds logical, i.e to sort team names alphabetically, and grades numerically. To sort by both ascending and descending order.
noProblem Yes, the design seems to be sound.
noProblem The authors have justified the use of jQuery table sorter by listing its advantages.

noProblem The design is extremely simple and easy to understand. Good work guys :)
noProblem Yes, the solution proposed is simple by using the  jQuery tablesorter gem.
noProblem The use of jQuery plugin sounds simple and easy to use.
noProblem The design looks simple and clear.
noProblem The modifications that are suggested by the team are minimalistic and cover the changes that are necessary for the javascript library to work. While it is possible to infer the majority of changes that will be introduced in this project, it would be better if the authors elaborated on the implementation of all the views as opposed to discussing only the "view submissions" table. 
noProblem This their design is very simple and clear.
noProblem This part has been significantly improved from the previous submission. The diagram make it very easy for an outsider to understand the architecture, the underlying problems and the proposed solution. 
noProblem Yes. The figures added to the wiki clearly indicate the changes that will be made to each view. The columns that will be made sortable and how will the made sortable. Good work :)
noProblem The flowchart added gives a good idea of the final outcome after implementation of the changes proposed. Suggestion: A diagram explaining the plan of changes to be made will make the document easier to read.
noProblem This team used great diagrams that add to their documentation's clarity significantly.
noProblem There are multiple visual elements that improve the readability of the document. Screenshots of the UI tables help with the illustration of the required changes. Furthermore, the UML diagram demonstrates the relation between relevant flows.
noProblem The team has added good number of mock UIs and UML diagram and clearly explains the code follow. All of them are self-explanatory and needs no improvement
noProblem diagram is added. 
noProblem No visulization is necessary for this project
noProblem You have a lot of testing scenarios which is really good
noProblem I suggest the testing plan be improved. In place of giving steps on how a reviewer should test the project, the team should instead list how they wish to write tests for the functionality added. The rspec could be something like expect(page).to have_content(sorted)
noProblem The design doc includes the test plan which covers all the changes that will be made.
noProblem There is a detail explanation on how the function testing will be carried out under the teating plan section of the wiki doc.
noProblem Yes it includes test plan. It is very well written and will test the functionalities.
noProblem Test plans looks to be an overview of the functionality, In the test plan i see the functionalities explained l
noProblem The test plan is present. It consists of a set of functional tests described for each of the five views. I would suggest elaborating on the technical side of tests, for example specifying which spec files will be modified or whether or not the project will utilize RSpec. Moreover, it would be better if the team provided a rationale for why it is sufficient to use only functional tests.
noProblem the test plan is thorough. 
noProblem They have discussed clearly what functionalities they are going to test to make the project more efficient. I think they have made a quite descent research in the testing aspect of the project.
noProblem The design includes the test plan.
noProblem Yes, the test plan looks good. The author lists all the cases they need to test.
noProblem Yes. The authors have made changes to the design document and are more specific about how exactly they plan to implement the new functionality.
noProblem The team has mentioned properly what changes they are doing and how they will be doing them. In the first submission they had suggested the possible approaches. Now, they are having a concrete way they are implementing these changes.
noProblem Yes, and at times, much more than necessary! 
noProblem No changes has been done
noProblem Yes, they explained a lot for the changes. Great job!
noProblem  The authors have done good job explaining the changes to be made to the system, and even explaining why other, more obvious options, are not chosen. It still sounds like a complicated change to make to the system.
noProblem The team added more information from the last time which aided in a better explanation of the problem. Good job team
noProblem 1) The authors have adequately explained the changes to be made to the design document.
noProblem The explanations are more than sufficient. Not only have the authors explained the changes to the system, but also explained the reasoning for considering those changes. I like the way that they also explained the other different ways they could've integrated the GitHub metrics but avoided those methods with sufficient reasoning for the same.The team has also given an explanation of their database design modifications would be like which is good.
noProblem The authors have dived into the depths when explaining the changes. All of the changes are well defined and precise.
noProblem Yes , excellent work done by the team. The design document adequately explains what is the problem that they are trying to solve, what is the proposed solution and how the solution would look like.  There are enough details to in the document to understand what is being done and what changes are proposed. The document also has enough illustrations on what is the current situation. 
noProblem Yes, they did.
noProblem The authors adequately explained the changes they plan to make.
noProblem Yes
noProblem The authors have very well explained the problem statement and the changes to be made to the system, including flowcharts, the files to be modified/added and useful links.
noProblem Authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system. The design document was easy to understand.
noProblem The team is going to improve compatibility with web content that relies on the WebAudio API by implementing missing pieces of incomplete node types (OscillatorNode) along with entire missing nodes (ConstantSourceNode, StereoPannerNode, IIRFilterNode). 
noProblem Yes, they made detailed explanation about their changes.

noProblem Yes, there is a detailed test plan for this project. Not only basic features testing but also other more testing.
noProblem The test plan looks really thorough covering all the possible scenarios. I am personally happy with the given test-plan.
noProblem They have discussed clearly what functionalities they are going to test to make the project more efficient. I think they have made a quite descent research in the testing aspect of the project.
noProblem The design includes the test plan.
noProblem Yes, the test plan looks good. The author lists all the cases they need to test.
noProblem They have a paragraph saying what they are going to do, but it could be broken up into parts with images for better understanding
noProblem They have one scenario. maybe a few more could help better test their work
noProblem Yes, the proposed solutions part clearly stated that they will go through each review to compare the new review score, etc, and then they will store the review URL. However, the solution is not concrete enough and is a little bit hard to follow. It should be great if there's more details in stating about how to loop through each reviews.  
noProblem No changes has been done
noProblem Yes, they explained a lot for the changes. Great job!
noProblem The team has mentioned properly what changes they are doing and how they will be doing them. In the first submission they had suggested the possible approaches. Now, they are having a concrete way they are implementing these changes.
noProblem Yes, and at times, much more than necessary! 
noProblem Yes. The authors have made changes to the design document and are more specific about how exactly they plan to implement the new functionality.
noProblem The team added more information from the last time which aided in a better explanation of the problem. Good job team
noProblem 1) The authors have adequately explained the changes to be made to the design document.
noProblem The explanations are more than sufficient. Not only have the authors explained the changes to the system, but also explained the reasoning for considering those changes. I like the way that they also explained the other different ways they could've integrated the GitHub metrics but avoided those methods with sufficient reasoning for the same.The team has also given an explanation of their database design modifications would be like which is good.
noProblem Yes , excellent work done by the team. The design document adequately explains what is the problem that they are trying to solve, what is the proposed solution and how the solution would look like.  There are enough details to in the document to understand what is being done and what changes are proposed. The document also has enough illustrations on what is the current situation. 
noProblem The authors adequately explained the changes they plan to make.
noProblem The team has provided a code snippet which includes solution to their problem statement. They have described the code and their proposed changes
noProblem By looking at the flow-charts and UML diagrams submitted by the team, their solution appears to be sound.
noProblem The team has provided diagrams that make it easier for the reader to understand the workflow of the system and the changes that they have proposed to implement the solution.
noProblem As mentioned, the team has provided UML diagrams stating the two actors in their system- Student, Instructor and their interaction with the email module and database.
noProblem The design seems to be sound. They have a sample design where they are explaining the tables and how they plan to work with them as well. The examples provided help understand how the data will be stored.
noProblem Yes
noProblem Design is okay
noProblem Yes
noProblem Very basic design
noProblem No visualization
noProblem No test plan
noProblem  The design appears to be sound. They have weighed their options and are using an official gem to interact with the github api.
noProblem I don't see any issue in the design document. They have followed a good design principle.
noProblem 1) The authors have mentioned several approaches in which these functionalities could be implemented. 2) Their chosen approach is follows MVC architecture and DRY principles.
noProblem  The design sound very reasonable.
noProblem The design is concise and clear. They have added reference images of how the system would look after their changes, which properly shows the expected implementation results.
noProblem Yes. It is thoroughly investigated.
noProblem Yes
noProblem Their design is much simple and clear, also easy to understand.
noProblem With proper documentation, the problem is explained nicely and understanding of the complex problem is made easier.
noProblem 1) Have clearly mentioned when will GitHub Api be hit to retrive the data and which gem will be used.
noProblem  Their design is simple and clear.
noProblem The use case diagram properly shows how the addition of this feature will help for the instructor role.
noProblem The visualizations used by the team are comprehensive and well made.
noProblem Good design
noProblem excellent use of screenshots, made things very clear for me.
noProblem Yes, they use a lot of diagrams to show use case.
noProblem Use case diagram is present but it would have been nice to see a sequence diagram to understand the flow. 
noProblem Explains the different approaches with the help of use case diagram.
noProblem  They not only use use case diagram but also mock-up screenshot to help the reader understand their design.
noProblem The test plan seems adequate at this stage, edge cases may need to be considered at a later stage.
noProblem No
noProblem The authors have explained well what changes they wish to make and how they plan to implement those changes. I would suggest them to add more details like, "where do they store the list of responses more than the notification threshold". Overall good job.
noProblem Yes, it includes the test plan with a great detail.
noProblem  The test plan seems adequate enough to show that they understand what to test.
noProblem Yes, the design is as simple as it can get. Understanding the principle is not hard. But making it simple should also not make it costly. Good work to the team if the instructors were looking for something this simple :)
noProblem The UML diagrams given in the document list the process flow for testing/understanding the changes which will be made in the document. But, unfortunately, no diagram exists which describe the changes to be made.   I would suggest the team to add diagrams for the pseudo-code they may have written.
noProblem  Test plans for both of their subtasks were present.
noProblem A format of the proposed email to be sent would be helpful
noProblem some additional tests can be added
noProblem Yes, the problem statement and the proposed changes have been clearly explained.
noProblem The design and application flow appear to be as simple as possible, as well as the proposed code changes snippet provided.
noProblem There are UML and application flow diagrams included with the design document, which serve to make the proposed design changes much clearer.
noProblem Test plan is as simple as required for the problem statement in question.
noProblem Yes, they include this part in the Proposed Solutions field. It would be better if they use visualization to let the readers better understand the flow.
noProblem The design seems workable. Maybe they can come up a more sound design. For example, they can try many ways to define the notification limit.
noProblem The design is simple and really better than before.
noProblem After the first review, the design has improved significantly. The proposed design clearly defines the changes being made by the team.
noProblem There has been a significant improvement in the level of details provided. The author can further improve the document by providing the details of the design pattern to be used.
noProblem The design seems to be pretty straightforward.
noProblem The author uses the UML diagram to properly describe the system. 
noProblem The document does contain a test plan which can definitely be extended to incorporate certain negative test cases.
noProblem The design has improved and updates has been done and it is easy to comprehend the changes to be made to the system.
noProblem The design seems simple.
noProblem Proper diagrams are used by the team. 
noProblem Design doc includes the test plan but more detail on negative test cases would have been better.
noProblem Yes, the use of visualization is great.
noProblem I know exactly what this team is doing.
noProblem It seems as though this team's approach was well designed.
noProblem The way the team plans to loop through each review to calculate a review score seems slightly more complex than necessary, but I agree with them taking this apporach as it will allow them to break down the reason why the scores are different.
noProblem They have a lot of mockups showing what they plan to do 
noProblem Yes, they include a problem statement in this page. The statement is clear and easy to understand.
noProblem The team has well explained the changes to be made to the system.
noProblem Yes, the authors have explained the changes to be made clearly along with diagrams
noProblem All the changes made to the system have been supplemented with explanations and mock-ups.
noProblem Explanations are okay , there needs to be more detail on what is being done and how the final outlook view would be. As of now not much details have been put in the document. A before and after view would have adequately shown the impact the this work will make. 
noProblem  Yes, there is few basic details mentioned in the document, but not adequate changes are explained. It's far better work than last round, yet the team has to give a better overview on Bacui and elaborate the problem statement.
noProblem The team has updated their design document to include all the changes they are planning to make. This is a good improvement from the earlier version.
noProblem Design is good
noProblem The design is reasonable and workable.
noProblem Since its UI based project, their design is pretty intuitive and simple.
noProblem There is no scope of using any design patterns or principles since this is a UI-based project and there is no scope for the application of design principles.
noProblem There is no design provided in the document, as its mainly UI changes. Yet, the team should have dived in detail about their choices to achieve a particular look and feel needed. The document seems to be over-simplification of the implementation and can be improved further.  
noProblem The changes are to be made in the UI and the team is planning to use appropriate design elements.
noProblem team plans to use all of the bootstrap functions and 
noProblem Yes, the design doc is simple and well explained
noProblem Yes, the design appears to be as simple as possible. There are a limited number of Bootstrap components being used the complexity of the project is limited and the end result appears to be as simple as possible.
noProblem Yes this looks simple with several point fixes required to be done. The authors also talk about using bootstrap 4 which is good. I would have liked if they could quickly put up certain mock screens using the bootstrap.  
noProblem The tasks they need to do seems simple but more design details are needed.
noProblem Yes, the design is very simple.
noProblem Team has done their best in visualizing whatever design they had.
noProblem The diagrams added clearly explain which views need to be modified, but if the team could just mark the point where changes are to be made in the screenshot, it would be the icing on the cake. Still good work :)
noProblem They gave all the UI interfaces they are going to make. It's suggested that they can include the origin page and the changed page which the reader can compare with.
noProblem They have included mock UI screens which make their proposed changes quite clear. 
noProblem Class diagrams/UML diagrams do not apply here. But explanation with snapshots is provided.
noProblem Not necessary since it's a UI based project.
noProblem No, i feel that that adequate visual aids and diagrams are missing in the document. only a few screens to show. It would have been better if the authors could have put before and after details on what is being done. uml diagrams to show the flow and then justify the changes that they are trying to make  
noProblem Make sure to test each interactions properly after the design is complete.
noProblem no test plan section at all
noProblem Since it's Ui project, they says they will test all the pages changed.
noProblem Since this is a UI based project, they don't need any functionality testing. the team is planning to do manual testing which is all they need to for this project.
noProblem No, UI tests can be added here, but the team has not considered them.
noProblem No tests needed.
noProblem No test plan
noProblem There are no tests included in the document, but there is an issue need to be fixed, which needs test plan to make sure it can work correctly. Also, the UI need to test to guarantee the intended results.
noProblem There is no test plan.
noProblem Yes, the authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system. Document is simple, succinct and easy to understand. Great use of flow charts, uml diagrams and mockups to visually represent the information is done. 
noProblem  Yes the author has provided a sufficient explanation of what changes needs to be done to the system by giving flow diagrams and screenshots about what changes they are going to incorporate in their system
noProblem Team has added all the diagrams and screenshots. The document is well explained and looks complete.
noProblem Yes, their explanations are adequately explained the changes.
noProblem 1) The authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system. 2) They also have given the files to be modified/added for each change.  
noProblem Authors have clearly explained all the changes to be made and where to make them. The design document is quite clear and easy to understand.
noProblem I think that the authors have done a really good job of explaining and covering all the changes to be made. Overall this is the best document i have seen so far.

noProblem Yes, the design follows appropriate principles and patterns. suggestions: not required.
noProblem Design is good
noProblem Yes, their design is very sound, and principles and patterns are used appropriately.
noProblem 1) The design appears to be sound. 2) Also follows proper design principles eg: for making changes to nomination and review questions, inheritance is used (inheriting methods from questions parent class)
noProblem The design seems to be appropriate and sound. It follows appropriate principles.
noProblem Yes, the design appears to be very sound and follows all the principles that I know. I loved the format of the documentation as well.
noProblem They have explained very well
noProblem Yes the design follows simple rails concepts and is pretty straightforward. I would like to see if the team uses existing gems available to speed up implementation and re use.   
noProblem Yes, the design appears to be sound and well made. 
noProblem The design seems to be very simple. I think the team has avoided unnecessary complications and are doing minimal changes to existing system to solve issues given to them.
noProblem The design approach seems justified and inline with the functionalities required to be implemented. They have mentioned step wise details for all the changes they are going to take. Done a good job. No rework required.
noProblem  Yes the design is presented in a much simpler form which gives a very clear picture of how the changes are going to be implemented and which functionalities would be witnessing the changes , also as they have provide the screenshots it enhances the understanding about the project more.

noProblem Great use of UML diagrams, flowcharts and mock-ups by the team to clearly explain the flow of their work. It is easy to understand the flow and how the end product will look like.
noProblem They team has done awesome work in representing every detail possible in the flow diagrams. They have created UML diagrams which depicts the flow of the admin and students along with other actors. As mentioned earlier they have also represented the admin flow diagram and instructor flow diagram through the flow chart which makes it very easy for end user to understand the workflow of the requirements in the expertiza system.
noProblem  Yes the visualization is pretty clear and good.
noProblem Proper use of UML to explain the use cases and flow charts to explain the workflow has been done. The plan is complete.
noProblem Yes, their visualization is good. They are clear and well described the changes.
noProblem  The design document includes flow charts, UML diagrams and screenshots which is really impressive as it made the document easier to understand.
noProblem I loved the overall use of the visualizations which aids to the understanding of the whole doc. The formatting of the documentation makes it really easy to read and understand.
noProblem Yes, the uml diagrams sufficiently provide visualization.
noProblem The authors have added UML diagrams as requested in the previous review and it has made a lot of difference. The explanation is much clearer now.
noProblem Test plan outlines the functionalities that the team will test and it seems sufficient to test the changes.
noProblem They team has done tremendous job in following the test driven approach for the project implementation. They have already included the tests they are writing for the functionality implementation. They have covered the exhaustive scenarios  for the project in their test. Their test plan is highly appreciative.
noProblem  The test plan is quite good as it covers all the test cases in the form of 11 test cases which test all the functionalities for the admin and the instructor role. It also considers the negative test cases like throwing an exception when the pending instructor tries to add more then 10 students to his/her course.
noProblem Yes, they include the test plan.
noProblem 1) The test cases cover all of the functionalities that they are going to implement.
noProblem Yes, the document includes a test plan. There was no test plan present in the previous version of the design document but the team included the test plan in the second round. The test plan is clear and seems like it would really test the functionalities.
noProblem The test plan has been written in a very good way following the great quality of documentation till the end. It covers all the edge cases and scenarios.
noProblem The test plans are excellent. The best I have seen so far.It has accurately taken all test cases into consideration and described the layout of the final test in the form of a pseudo code. Well Done on the test plan!!
noProblem Yes, test plans are included
noProblem Yes, the test plan looks good. It covers all the functionalities.
noProblem Test plan seems thorough and well thought out.
noProblem The team is following a Test Driven Development approach. They have defined the test cases that need to be tested after the implementation. It seems to completely test the feature.
noProblem The team has mentioned properly what changes they are doing and how they will be doing them. In the first submission they had suggested the possible approaches. Now, they are having a concrete way they are implementing these changes.
noProblem Yes. The authors have made changes to the design document and are more specific about how exactly they plan to implement the new functionality.
noProblem Yes, they explained a lot for the changes. Great job!
noProblem 1) The authors have adequately explained the changes to be made to the design document.
noProblem Yes , excellent work done by the team. The design document adequately explains what is the problem that they are trying to solve, what is the proposed solution and how the solution would look like.  There are enough details to in the document to understand what is being done and what changes are proposed. The document also has enough illustrations on what is the current situation.

noProblem Yes
noProblem Yes
noProblem  The design appears to be sound. They have weighed their options and are using an official gem to interact with the github api.
noProblem I don't see any issue in the design document. They have followed a good design principle.
noProblem 1) The authors have mentioned several approaches in which these functionalities could be implemented. 2) Their chosen approach is follows MVC architecture and DRY principles.
noProblem Yes, the github api integration looks good. the only part missing was perhaps they could have documented the rest calls that they are going to make in the document as well. Usage of existing gems is good and eases lot of implementation pains  
noProblem  The design sound very reasonable.
noProblem The design is concise and clear. They have added reference images of how the system would look after their changes, which properly shows the expected implementation results.
noProblem Yes. It is thoroughly investigated.
noProblem Yes
noProblem Their design is much simple and clear, also easy to understand.
noProblem Yeah, I believe it is as simple as possible while choosing the best path for the expertiza project to grow, but it still sounds like a very ambitious project for 1 group to complete.
noProblem With proper documentation, the problem is explained nicely and understanding of the complex problem is made easier.
noProblem  Their design is simple and clear.
noProblem Yes, the authors are using already existing gems for the implementation. I would have liked to see a section on caching if any.  Rest the solution proposed looks simple and straightforward and looks that it will easily integrate into the current system  
noProblem The use case diagram properly shows how the addition of this feature will help for the instructor role.
noProblem The visualizations used by the team are comprehensive and well made.
noProblem Good design
noProblem excellent use of screenshots, made things very clear for me.

noProblem Explains the different approaches with the help of use case diagram.
noProblem  They not only use use case diagram but also mock-up screenshot to help the reader understand their design.
noProblem The test plan does include a high level of testing scenarios the team plans to cover. I would suggest the team should add BDD tests so they can test the same after the development phase is over.
noProblem The test plan seems adequate at this stage, edge cases may need to be considered at a later stage.
noProblem No
noProblem Yes, it includes the test plan with a great detail.
noProblem  The test plan seems adequate enough to show that they understand what to test.
noProblem Good test plan. Should include more test cases that check the functionality of GitHub integration. eg: If number of lines of code committed by a student is correctly computed.
noProblem The design includes a test plan. However the test plan has nothing related to tests or which test cases are going to be considered. It just explains the flow of how an instructor would reach the GitHub metrics data page.The team should at least mention which files are the test cases going to be written on and what functionalities are they going to test.
noProblem The test section looks inadequate as of now, only two test scenarios are mentioned and no details on automation or UI.  More so no mention of tests in the document.
noProblem  Test plans for both of their subtasks were present.
noProblem The author has excellently explained about the changes that they would be making by providing the design diagram and the screenshot of the the changes that they have incorporated .Also they have mentioned about their choice of tool which is google chart and why do they prefer , so overall a good explanation
noProblem Changes that's needs to be made has been explained correctly.
noProblem Yes, their doc has adequately explained the changes.
noProblem The team have a well written design document and and the authors have explained the proposed changes well. The authors have also listed each file they are going to be changed.
noProblem yes, the team has well explained the changes that they are going to make. Last time it was a bit confusing but this time because of the help of the diagrams and mock UI screen, the solution seems clear now.
noProblem The authors have explained the changes made to the system. The design flow greatly helps to understand the flow of the system.
noProblem The authors have described what all changes they plan to do and where they plan to do it. Compared to the previous version of the design document they have now included what tools and framework they plan to work on. The design document looks complete and understandable now.
noProblem They will be changing mostly html and erb code to create a visual interface that delivers information to instructors more effectively.
noProblem The proposed changes have been explained in a simple manner.
noProblem The document adequately describes the project description and proposals made. The proposed change of generating a single or single bar chart graph based on the categories selected to display the chart, can be efficiently made to the system.
noProblem They have improved the document to provide a better description of changes to be made to the system.
noProblem Yes the design is sound and gives a proper explanation about how their implementation would behave.
noProblem Design seems correct.
noProblem Yes, their design is clear and sound, and the principles and patterns are well used.
noProblem The design documents is well explained. the authors haven't mentioned any design pattern as such. The authors have clearly stated the proposed changes though. they could have added uml and crc cards.
noProblem yeah their design seems to be sound and neat.
noProblem System is well defined 
noProblem The design document is good and I don't think any design pattern needs to be followed as very few changes are being made. 
noProblem The design makes use of the Google charts tool to generate visual charts for specific criteria set. Based on the design flow, it appears that the functionality can be consistently performed to generate the visual graph for the instructor.

noProblem Yes, design involves google charts API and seems very simple.
noProblem Yes the design flow and the screenshots very clearly describes the changes made to the system.
noProblem Flow diagram explains the flow correctly.
noProblem Yes, they have used visualization to help people understand their design.
noProblem They have worked on their weak point. Earlier their solution does not seem cogent but I would say now they have made good progress.
noProblem The sample data visualizations is good. The way they have given visualizations for sample data is nice. easier to understand and good.
noProblem The team already has mockups for their design.
noProblem The visualization is great, the screenshots clearly indicate the proposed output of the project.
noProblem Really good visualization provided.
noProblem According to the team "The specification of the project does not require us to use automated tests" but they plan to test the modified ruby code or the new features using the RSpec testing framework. Overall, the test  plan sounds good 
noProblem No tests are required for the project as stated
noProblem This team did not require any tests.
noProblem The design document does not include a test plan as testing requirement is very minimal since most changes are in view.
noProblem The test plan section specifies that it does not require performing any automated tests. However, since the new functionality of adding a visual diagram, the team would modified ruby code for the functions added to the grades_controller.
noProblem Yes, changes to be made are explained clearly. Document is very clear, includes necessary diagrams, mock-ups and everything possible to make anyone understand what the issues are and what team is planning to do to resolve them. Everything is included in a proper order like for each issue there is a separate flowchart and mock-up. No suggestions required.
noProblem yes the authors have adaquately explained the changes to be made in the system.
noProblem The document is clearly and neatly written. All the necessary sections are present with good explanations.
noProblem Changes are well explained with good visual aids.
noProblem They have explained every change they want to make to fix the issue. The diagrams, in turn, help a lot to understand the flow of the system.
noProblem Yes the authors have adequately explained all the changes that need to be made. Each issue has a separate list of changes to be made and which files need to be edited.
noProblem The changes are very well documented. For each issue what are the files that needs to be changed is mentioned appropriately. The overall design looks efficient and avoids any duplication. Good Job!
noProblem Yes, they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection. They have not only given proper UML diagrams and the like, but they have also implemented the code and showcased in the "Test Plan" and the "Proposed Design" section. 
noProblem In round one, Team has well explained their approach and how are they going to do it. In this round, they have included detailed information and mock UI. It was easy to relate their approach. Their test plan is also thorough. I think the team would definitely be able to incorporate the new changes. Good job guys! 
noProblem The design was well explained in this design doc.
noProblem Well explanation on problem statement. UML diagrams, flow charts given. Detailed explanation on problem statement. 
noProblem yes!

noProblem The design appears to be simple given the task at hand.
noProblem Yes, the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the staggered deadlines assignment section. 
noProblem Undoubtedly, I like their color coding approach. It's something very simple and apt for the current system.
noProblem The design seems simple and clear.
noProblem very clear
noProblem Yes, the provided diagrams deliver sufficient information about the implementation. Flowcharts and mock UIs screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required changes. No suggestions required.

noProblem The diagram is perfect and clear
noProblem Yes, design does include a well-described test plan. The provided tests will surely test the functionalities which will be implemenedt. The test plan is represented in a wonderful manner including pre-steps and different testing expectations. Great work. No suggestions are required.
noProblem The test plan is comprehensive.
noProblem They have covered all the test plans along with detailed steps.
noProblem The test plan is thorough and contains lots of detail that will make it easy to design RSpec tests in the future.
noProblem The Test Plans are thorough and they gone ahead and shown it in detail by breaking them into steps such as pre-steps, Functional, UI and Performance Testing. This is a very good way to achieve in-depth analysis of the problem and check how effective the solution is.
noProblem I have to say their test plan includes user interface testing, performance testing, database testing etc. I have to say they have worked really hard for it. I have not yet come across any team who has a test plan like this. 
noProblem An appropriate test plan is included in this design doc.
noProblem yes the test coverage seems good
noProblem After the first review, the design has improved significantly. The proposed design clearly defines the changes being made by the team.
noProblem Yes, the proposed solutions part clearly stated that they will go through each review to compare the new review score, etc, and then they will store the review URL. However, the solution is not concrete enough and is a little bit hard to follow. It should be great if there's more details in stating about how to loop through each reviews.  
noProblem They have a paragraph saying what they are going to do, but it could be broken up into parts with images for better understanding
noProblem The authors have explained well what changes they wish to make and how they plan to implement those changes. I would suggest them to add more details like, "where do they store the list of responses more than the notification threshold". Overall good job.
noProblem A format of the proposed email to be sent would be helpful
noProblem Yes, they include this part in the Proposed Solutions field. It would be better if they use visualization to let the readers better understand the flow.
noProblem The team has provided a code snippet which includes solution to their problem statement. They have described the code and their proposed changes
noProblem I know exactly what this team is doing.
noProblem Yes, the problem statement and the proposed changes have been clearly explained.
noProblem The design has improved and updates has been done and it is easy to comprehend the changes to be made to the system.
noProblem There has been a significant improvement in the level of details provided. The author can further improve the document by providing the details of the design pattern to be used.
noProblem Design is okay
noProblem Design does seem to be sound, but complex. As mentioned in the earlier review, I am unsure if looping over each review is the correct thing to do or not. Maybe the team discussed this with the mentor and decided against it as no new information has been added in the document. If so, I would only suggest the team to include the complexity of the design in the document.
noProblem The design seems workable. Maybe they can come up a more sound design. For example, they can try many ways to define the notification limit.
noProblem By looking at the flow-charts and UML diagrams submitted by the team, their solution appears to be sound.
noProblem It seems as though this team's approach was well designed.
noProblem The design seems to be pretty straightforward.
noProblem The design is simple, although it could be better if it has more concrete examples.
noProblem Yes, the design is as simple as it can get. Understanding the principle is not hard. But making it simple should also not make it costly. Good work to the team if the instructors were looking for something this simple :)
noProblem Yes, it simple but some parts are not easy to understand.
noProblem The design is simple and really better than before.
noProblem The team has provided diagrams that make it easier for the reader to understand the workflow of the system and the changes that they have proposed to implement the solution.
noProblem The way the team plans to loop through each review to calculate a review score seems slightly more complex than necessary, but I agree with them taking this apporach as it will allow them to break down the reason why the scores are different.
noProblem The design does appear to be simple, as they have not planned to modify any of the existing methods. Their new method will interact with Response, AssignmentQuestionnaire model, and then link the assignment to the review in the email. However, they have not mentioned if they have planned any data structure/variable to store the assignment link and pass it on to the method where email notification will be sent. But, i suppose that storing it in a variable will suffice. 
noProblem The design and application flow appear to be as simple as possible, as well as the proposed code changes snippet provided.
noProblem The design seems simple.
noProblem The author uses the UML diagram to properly describe the system. 
noProblem Yes, the use of visualization is great.
noProblem They used the UML diagrams, it really help me a lot when reading the wiki page. Maybe they can also make diagrams about the changes they are going to make.
noProblem As mentioned, the team has provided UML diagrams stating the two actors in their system- Student, Instructor and their interaction with the email module and database.
noProblem The visualization aids used currently are application flow diagram, and use cases. They are useful to understand the scenario of the problem statement. However, a sequence or a communication diagram will really be beneficial to understand how the method interfaces with the other  methods. This will help identify if the new method impacts other functionalities and will portray the proposed solution efficiently.
noProblem There are UML and application flow diagrams included with the design document, which serve to make the proposed design changes much clearer.
noProblem Proper diagrams are used by the team. 
noProblem The document does contain a test plan which can definitely be extended to incorporate certain negative test cases.
noProblem They have one scenario. maybe a few more could help better test their work
noProblem some additional tests can be added
noProblem They did include a test plan. It would be better if they also test the instructor side.
noProblem The test plan seems overly simplistic. It only tests whether the team's changes work in the most drastic scenario possible. It seems like they should have more boundary value tests and more test cases to account for their new method of looping through the reviews to compare new reviews with previous ones.
noProblem Test plan is as simple as required for the problem statement in question.
noProblem Design doc includes the test plan but more detail on negative test cases would have been better.
noProblem Yes. The authors do have an adequate explanation. 
noProblem they have also added the UML diagrams which makes things a lot more clearer
noProblem I cannot remember what the explanation looked like last week, but the read through this week felt very clear. The organization of the article felt like it followed the logic of a design project. The problem statement felt like it was reduced to a clear, concise, set of requirements that are attainable. The addition of the program flow diagram and an explanation as to why there is no UML diagram also helped to cement my understanding and set my expectations.
noProblem Good work on adding UML diagrams. Now the problem is very well explained.
noProblem The authors have lucidly explained the changes that are to be made to the system. They show the current state of the system and the expected state which includes a new button to Analyze the review content in the segmented text box. The authors have specified 2 files that they plan to modify namely the view file response.html.erb and a partial _self_review.html.erb. The team clearly show the format of the response popup with suggestion metrics that capture sentiment score, sentiment tone, whether suggestions are present or not, chance of suggestions, volume of text and the volume of text without stop words. They also propose to improve the response time of extracting the output from the API.One suggestion is that the team could have touched upon the working of the suggestion detection algorithm though it is not part of their current implementation. They do mention that it is a black box and have included a link to the deployed NLP project for suggestion algorithm, where users can test the suggestion metrics generated for custom text.
noProblem yes they have explained it very well.
noProblem The changes proposed are well explained and clearly indicate the intended output.
noProblem The authors have adequately explained changes made to the system. They have explained the problem and proposed solution clearly and supported it with appopriate diagrams.
noProblem Very detailed and precise. Solution explained thoroughly. 
noProblem They explained from their requirements and in their flow, that they only need to plan to edit the View, so there is no need for a UML.
noProblem Documentation is proper. Team could have added DB tables as well in the design doc.
noProblem Since the task is to integrate a web service in the existing system, the design mentioned is sound and reasonably primitive. 
noProblem yes it does based on the proposed solution.
noProblem The design is good. However, there is no scope of using bad principles since the number of files that will be affected are minimal and restricted to just 2.
noProblem The design doc is sound and I believe no design patterns are required for this project.
noProblem The design appears sound.
noProblem Yes, design seems fit. More insight required on the algorithm itself and how it will be implemented.
noProblem Yes, the design in its current form seems straight forward.
noProblem The Requirements were distilled down to the fewest simple terms possible without over-generalization. It felt like they just gave me the tl;dr statement without any fluffy words to waste my time, and also feels like they have a strong grasp over what they are expected to accomplish.
noProblem Yes, the design appears to be simple. 
noProblem Yes the design is simple and illustrated well with the use of wireframes showing the current, expected state and UML diagram showing the flow diagram. It depicts that once the Analyze button is clicked, the request is sent as JSON which contains the text typed by reviewer in the segmented textbox to the API which generates the suggestion metrics. The response contains the suggestion metrics like sentiment score, sentiment tone, presence of suggestions, chance of suggestion, total volume of text and volume of text without stop words. 
noProblem Yes, the design is simple and clear. The task is to integrate a web service which returns a result in JSON format.
noProblem yes it does appear to be simple as possible.
noProblem The design is as simple as it could be since the flow of logic is pretty linear and there is no scope of complexity. The changes also seems to be restricted to just one file which is good and in keeping with sound principles.
noProblem The actual project work might not have been started yet so the code modifications have not been mentioned. But the files to be modified seem appropriate.
noProblem The design appears very simple.
noProblem The project does not necessarily need diagramatic explanations but UML diagrams have been used which show implementation plan fairly well.
noProblem The Flow diagram mentioned in the document clearly explains the changes need to be done.
noProblem the screenshots of the Expertiza system are very helpful in understanding the problem and the solution
noProblem The program flow diagram and an explanation as to why there is no UML diagram also helped to cement my understanding and set my expectations.
noProblem UML diagram explains the changes.
noProblem Yes, this team has made the best use of visualization tools that can be applied to their project. They have clearly shown wireframes of the current response page juxtaposed with the expected state with the Analyze button next to each rubric. The document also includes the flow of the project represented as UML diagram. Once the Analyze button is clicked the request text is sent to the suggestion detection algorithm. The API returns the response which contains the suggestion metrics like sentiment score, sentiment tone, presence of suggestions, chance of suggestion, total volume of text and volume of text without stop words. 
noProblem The use of visualization is not pivotal for this task as it can be explained theoretically as well. But still, the team has made an effort to present the task with help of a flow diagram.
noProblem yes, very well explained.
noProblem The screenshots clearly display where the output would be displayed.
noProblem The UML diagrams clearly descibes the design of the solution. The screenshots explain changes required in the system adequately.
noProblem Yes UML diagram is provided and it is detailed. Flow diagrams explains how suggestions will be given. 
noProblem I think more tests can be added
noProblem The use cases appear to offer a quality, general test approach to see if their design does what it should.
noProblem Test cases have been added. 
noProblem The team has included test plan in Connextra format by including the feature specification and two scenarios- one happy path and one to capture the edge case of response generated with no text. No more test cases can be added to check if the team's part in the project is implemented well. Some test case scenarios that check the efficiency of the suggestion detection algorithm (for example: to detect review responses that generate the generalized suggestion for all the projects) can be included.
noProblem the tests given tests there changes, which is enough.
noProblem The test plan is complete. The team plans to test the two possible cases:1. When the review is blank. Response should be no review in text box.2. When review is present response is the result of suggestion metrics analysis. The team is right in testing just these two cases because they should not test if the API itself is returning a correct response as that would be against testing rules.
noProblem the test cases seem appropriate given that the only thing which needs to be tested is if the suggestion detection algorithm is displaying the intended output or not.
noProblem The design doc includes the test plan which covers changes in the functionalities.
noProblem Their test plan includes a test case for successfully displaying the pop-up text message as JSON, and displaying suggestion metrics for the review segment( a block of review, a comment box). Try to include test cases where a review message is absent, i.e. the code should not break for empty review segment. Include a test case where review segment has a suggestion, and test if the output says "Suggestion present". Include a negative test case for the the suggestion, where a suggestion is not given by the reviewer, and test that the output says "suggestion absent".
noProblem Yes. Functional tests with scenarios provided.
noProblem Good additions on the purpose and use case of your work.
noProblem The Introduction and Proposed Solution sections appropriately describes the problem and the approach to resolve the issue. The changes proposed can be concisely implemented into the system. They have enlisted use case diagrams for the entire scenario to be added to the rubrics.
noProblem The desgn looks okay
noProblem The team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made. the design looks good and easy to implement.
noProblem The design seems to be clear such that it provides the implementation procedure to be followed to include the feature of adding student generated questions to the rubrics.
noProblem The design is sound.
noProblem As per the documentation, the design seems simple.
noProblem Looks very doable

noProblem Yes, the design is simple and feasible.
noProblem Yes, clear and simple.
noProblem They have used apt visual aid like UML diagrams and screen shots
noProblem No class diagram, but there is er diagram and tables for database, it looks a little complex, but give the idea of what is involving.
noProblem Necessary diagrams are included.
noProblem The team has communicated their design clearly via use-case diagram and a class diagram with a description of various database tables involved.
noProblem Excellent use of visualizations. They already had an overall flow chart and this time additional tables and UML has been added. Best of what I've seen.
noProblem Yes they do explain everything. The er diagram, use case diagram, relevant tables explain everything.
noProblem The project has great visualization. A lot of UML diagrams have been included which makes the understanding the project easier. The UML diagrams also clarifies what work is to be done.
noProblem The pictures clearly demonstrate the changes being made to the system, although it is apparent where the changes would be visible. it would be nice if a image was posted having the current expertiza deployement to show where the changes would be visible
noProblem The team has described changes using use case and ER diagrams to clearly explain the system.
noProblem The authors add more diagrams to help to explain the change they are going to make. The relevant tables are really helpful.
noProblem test plans walk through necessary functionalities.
noProblem Yes, a good test plan is also included
noProblem The test cases described will cover the functionalities described given that they write multiples tests with the same structure as described for all search criteria. 
noProblem A concrete test plan is also added and it has both UI and automated test details.
noProblem Yes this is done very well.
noProblem They include a very described test plan. It has everything proper. What framework, what tests all this information is well included. They clearly specify what they aim to test.
noProblem The test plan is pretty good and it has both UI tests and automated tests. 
noProblem The test plan is designed efficiently. They have described the UI tests and automated tests which cover most of the cases. 
noProblem Two types of testing are listed, and the authors list all the cases they need to test.
noProblem Yes they have
noProblem explained details about their solution and what will be changed after their implementation.

noProblem Yes the authors have adequately explained all the changes that need to be made. Each issue has a separate list of changes to be made and which files need to be edited.
noProblem The changes are very well documented. For each issue what are the files that needs to be changed is mentioned appropriately. The overall design looks efficient and avoids any duplication. Good Job!
noProblem Yes, they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection. They have not only given proper UML diagrams and the like, but they have also implemented the code and showcased in the "Test Plan" and the "Proposed Design" section. 
noProblem In round one, Team has well explained their approach and how are they going to do it. In this round, they have included detailed information and mock UI. It was easy to relate their approach. Their test plan is also thorough. I think the team would definitely be able to incorporate the new changes. Good job guys! 
noProblem The design was well explained in this design doc.
noProblem Well explanation on problem statement. UML diagrams, flow charts given. Detailed explanation on problem statement. 
noProblem yes!
noProblem Yes, the document seems to be perfect. It does follow all the appropriate principles and patterns. No suggestions required.
noProblem As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.
noProblem The design is apt following the principles and are self-explanatory
noProblem Yes the design appears to be sound and the flow diagrams illustrate the flow of control very well.
noProblem All good design principles are being followed where necessary.
noProblem The design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the Logical Flow diagram they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the Proposed Design section so as to elucidate the problem statement.
noProblem The design appears to be neat. 
noProblem The design appears to be sound following the appropriate principles and patterns.
noProblem sound. so many diagrams.
noProblem Yes, it is the simplest design and minimal work which is required to resolve the issues. It is very clearly explained. One can clearly understand the problem statement and the proposed solution for the same. The design document is properly structured as well. 
noProblem design is simple and easy to understand.
noProblem Yes, simple straightforward solutions.
noProblem The diagrams are very basic and covering the entire scope which is a good work by the team
noProblem Yes the design is robust and simple to understand. Each class and view only handles a specific functionality i.e it is modularised.
noProblem Yes the design is straight forward and easy to understand.
noProblem The design appears to be simple given the task at hand.
noProblem Yes, the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the staggered deadlines assignment section. 
noProblem Undoubtedly, I like their color coding approach. It's something very simple and apt for the current system.
noProblem The design seems simple and clear.
noProblem very clear
noProblem Yes, the provided diagrams deliver sufficient information about the implementation. Flowcharts and mock UIs screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required changes. No suggestions required.
noProblem flowcharts are drawn which describe the flow how the system will work after implementation.
noProblem Great use of mock ups. Really appreciate it.
noProblem Yes, they have added mock UI screenshots which is exactly what they are going to and should do.
noProblem Yes the diagrams clearly illustrate the proposed flow. Different diagrams are provided for different issues. One of the best wikis I have seen
noProblem Very good use of Class and Sequence diagrams to explain the entire design flow. It clearly conveys the thought  process of authors and the overall design.
noProblem Lots of great visualizations are provided that outline a good amount of detail.
noProblem Yes, the diagrams are clear to show how the system works. But they, are not so lucid so as to show in the diagram how they are going to implement the changes in the system.   
noProblem The team has added their mock UI which shows they have thought about the changes and modification. Mock UIs of the screen shows they are halfway the project. 
noProblem The class diagram is very useful, and the mock UI with indication on it make it more useful.
noProblem Yes, design is informative. Change proposal is detailed. It describes well about how changes are to be implemented.
noProblem The diagram is perfect and clear
noProblem Yes, design does include a well-described test plan. The provided tests will surely test the functionalities which will be implemenedt. The test plan is represented in a wonderful manner including pre-steps and different testing expectations. Great work. No suggestions are required.
noProblem The design includes test plan.On the testb plan provided it seems like they will test the functionalities. But nothing mentioned on how they will write.
noProblem The test plan is comprehensive.
noProblem They have covered all the test plans along with detailed steps.
noProblem The test plan is thorough and contains lots of detail that will make it easy to design RSpec tests in the future.
noProblem The Test Plans are thorough and they gone ahead and shown it in detail by breaking them into steps such as pre-steps, Functional, UI and Performance Testing. This is a very good way to achieve in-depth analysis of the problem and check how effective the solution is.
noProblem I have to say their test plan includes user interface testing, performance testing, database testing etc. I have to say they have worked really hard for it. I have not yet come across any team who has a test plan like this. 
noProblem An appropriate test plan is included in this design doc.
noProblem yes the test coverage seems good
noProblem The authors have explained the required changes in a concise manner.
noProblem Yes, the project design is meaningful and clear. The solution is well laid out.
noProblem Yes. 
noProblem Yes, the authors have specified the changes to be made in the system under the proposed project design. The changes have been included as sub heading with sub points under each. The authors have also included a relevant files heading that includes the files where changes are made.The changes involve allowing the instructor to change language for a course. In the process a separate language column will be added to the Courses table and a dropdown of languages in the Edit Courses page where a language can be chosen. Once the instructor updates the Edit Course page with the chosen language, the static strings in the Expertiza application will be changed to the chosen language. For adding multi-language support, Google Translate and Rails Internationalization API is being used. Also, two yaml files- en.yml and hi_EN.yml contains the translated strings for the respective languages. The routes.rb file and all the view files will be correspondingly modified to show the different languages after reading from the yaml files. 
noProblem The explanations provided by the authors seems to be good. They have referred the Rails Internationalization API guide which provides sufficient explanation for multi language support. They have mentioned the different elements that will be changed and how an instructor would proceed to change the language of the course verbally. In addition they have also added mock-ups to visually represent this information.
noProblem The explainations are succinct. The description in technical design section and before-after images clearly shows what the project intends to do.
noProblem The changes are clearly mentioned , they are very clear what and where to make changes. Only suggestion would be to include more about how these changes are going to be done. 
noProblem Adding a languages column to the Courses table makes sense and so does leveraging third-party APIs to handle the translation.
noProblem The design is as required, following the appropriate patterns.
noProblem As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.
noProblem It is sound.
noProblem Looking at the design there seems to be high use of cohesion  and low coupling. It's good that all the changes are restricted to the routes.rb and config/locales files so that the resulting changes won't be messy and ruin the rest of the system. Also this helps in refactoring if needed in the future as there will be limited number of files to be changed.
noProblem Yes, the design appears to be as simple as possible. The team has mentioned what needs to be done and how they plan to implement it.
noProblem The changes have been explained well enough to minimize the complexity. The implementation seems extremely clear.
noProblem Yes, simple straightforward solution.  
noProblem Yes. Only view files are involving since this topic is about changing the language.
noProblem The design appears to be very simple. The team has avoided unnecessary complications by adhereing to the Rails Internationalization guide. They have also avoided making unnecessary changes to many files and kept the changes to the minimum number of files required.
noProblem The design is really crisp and easy to understand. One can clearly understand the problem statement and the proposed solution for the same. The design document is properly structured as well.
noProblem Yes the current design looks simple and wholesome. Seems they have done a good job in implementing understanding how rails internationalization works. Good job   
noProblem The visualization clearly and effectively conveys the translation capability which the project proposes to provide to Expertiza.
noProblem Yes, the provided diagrams deliver sufficient information about the implementation.
noProblem The necessary visual inputs to aid explanation are present.
noProblem mock UIs screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required changes.
noProblem There were mock-ups of the final result of the project however there were no UML diagrams. I think the UML diagrams are not necessary for this project since the flow of how the instructor will change the language is fairly simple and one can understand it by just reading the document. Maybe they could have done a mock-up of how some of the other views would have looked like once the language has changed. Especially the pages with flash messages if any. Currently they have just shown the proposed changes on the page where the instructor will change the language.
noProblem The team have written a test plan. But I feel more test cases could have been written to test the edge cases. Also the team could have explained their test cases in more detail.
noProblem A testplan that covers the entire functionality has been devised, it seems sufficient to test the change.
noProblem The test plan is compatible with the problem statement. 
noProblem Test plan have been shown clearly and tests are easy to understand.
noProblem Yup, because it only tests the ability to change the language.
noProblem The team explained everything required and not leave anything behind.
noProblem Yes, they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection. They have not only given proper UML diagrams and the like, but they have also implemented the code and showcased in the "Implementation" section. 
noProblem The wiki page is very explanatory and the authors have explained the issue and fix very well
noProblem Yes the required changes for the reviews is explained clearly. The design for each required change is also explained in depth now.
noProblem The authors have clearly mentioned the changes to be made using Problem Statement and Use Case Diagram.
noProblem Yes the author has made a great attempt to explain the changes by trying to explain the changes required with the help of the application flow diagram and the use case diagram and how the changes were implemented by giving screenshots of the changes.
noProblem The documentation done by the team is very detailed and explains the problem statement very clearly. They have described the functionality change in bullet points which makes it very easy to understand the sub parts required to achieve the main functionality in simple terms. 
noProblem I like the part where the peer review has been given more weightage in comparison to self review in the composite score.
noProblem The design appears to followed appropriate principles and patterns.
noProblem The design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the use case diagram in which the users are student and instructor and the data base is where the actions are stored in the database and the retrieved from the same for the case of reviews information.  Also, they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the Application Flow section so as to elucidate the problem statement.
noProblem Yes
noProblem Yes the design is very simple and explains the changes required in a very clear manner
noProblem The flow and UML diagrams are well designed and explain a lot about the system flow. addition of detailed use case helps support the diagram
noProblem The design seems to be following the appropriate principles and uses the appropriate guidelines. They usecase diagram mentions each actor and the role associated.
noProblem The design is as simple as possible.
noProblem Yes, the design looks simple , no complications and the screenshots are really helpful.
noProblem Yes the design is simple and easy to understand for others too. The explanation along with diagrams provides enough information to understand the use-case.
noProblem Yes, the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the review section. 
noProblem The design is simple and very much in depth. and follows the principle
noProblem es the design is very simple and explains the changes required in a very clear manner
noProblem Yes, the design appears to be as simple as possible. The team has mentioned what needs to be done and how they plan to implement it. Hence, it is easy to understand.
noProblem Application flow, use case diagram are both very useful to describe the changes,
noProblem Yes the visuals provided with this doc are clear and just by that a lot can be understood.
noProblem The use case diagram and application flow diagram very well explains the changes made to the system.
noProblem The chart and diagrams are well done and help explain how the code will work.
noProblem Basic UML used
noProblem Some UI screenshots are added along with design diagrams which describe the system. The UI or mock UI helps in better understanding
noProblem The visualizations seem to be complete. The team has included an application flow diagram, a use case diagram and also a screenshot of how the actual result should look. So, in my opinion, good job done!
noProblem The UML diagrams are detailed and explained well. Suggestion: The application flow could be explained in points so that the reviewer has a clearer view of what is the sequence of events occurring.
noProblem The team has done tremendous job in adding visualization aids. They have added application flow diagrams for every actor along with the UML diagram of the student and instructor. They have also included screenshots to explain the code functionality implementation of enabling self reviews and score pages. This makes the document descriptive and very easy to read and understand.  
noProblem A test plan is included in this design doc.
noProblem After the first review, the design has improved significantly. The proposed design clearly defines the changes being made by the team.
noProblem Not enough explanation
noProblem A format of the proposed email to be sent would be helpful
noProblem I know exactly what this team is doing.
noProblem Yes, the problem statement and the proposed changes have been clearly explained.
noProblem The design has improved and updates has been done and it is easy to comprehend the changes to be made to the system.
noProblem Design is okay
noProblem By looking at the flow-charts and UML diagrams submitted by the team, their solution appears to be sound.
noProblem It seems as though this team's approach was well designed.
noProblem The design seems to be pretty straightforward.
noProblem The team has provided diagrams that make it easier for the reader to understand the workflow of the system and the changes that they have proposed to implement the solution.
noProblem The design and application flow appear to be as simple as possible, as well as the proposed code changes snippet provided.
noProblem The design seems simple.
noProblem The author uses the UML diagram to properly describe the system. 
noProblem Yes, the use of visualization is great.
noProblem They used the UML diagrams, it really help me a lot when reading the wiki page. Maybe they can also make diagrams about the changes they are going to make.
noProblem As mentioned, the team has provided UML diagrams stating the two actors in their system- Student, Instructor and their interaction with the email module and database.
noProblem The visualization aids used currently are application flow diagram, and use cases. They are useful to understand the scenario of the problem statement. However, a sequence or a communication diagram will really be beneficial to understand how the method interfaces with the other  methods. This will help identify if the new method impacts other functionalities and will portray the proposed solution efficiently.
noProblem Proper diagrams are used by the team. 
noProblem There are UML and application flow diagrams included with the design document, which serve to make the proposed design changes much clearer.
noProblem The authors have explained the required changes in a concise manner.
noProblem Yes, the project design is meaningful and clear. The solution is well laid out.
noProblem Yes. 
noProblem Yes, the authors have specified the changes to be made in the system under the proposed project design. The changes have been included as sub heading with sub points under each. The authors have also included a relevant files heading that includes the files where changes are made.The changes involve allowing the instructor to change language for a course. In the process a separate language column will be added to the Courses table and a dropdown of languages in the Edit Courses page where a language can be chosen. Once the instructor updates the Edit Course page with the chosen language, the static strings in the Expertiza application will be changed to the chosen language. For adding multi-language support, Google Translate and Rails Internationalization API is being used. Also, two yaml files- en.yml and hi_EN.yml contains the translated strings for the respective languages. The routes.rb file and all the view files will be correspondingly modified to show the different languages after reading from the yaml files. 
noProblem The explanations provided by the authors seems to be good. They have referred the Rails Internationalization API guide which provides sufficient explanation for multi language support. They have mentioned the different elements that will be changed and how an instructor would proceed to change the language of the course verbally. In addition they have also added mock-ups to visually represent this information.
noProblem The explainations are succinct. The description in technical design section and before-after images clearly shows what the project intends to do.
noProblem Adding a languages column to the Courses table makes sense and so does leveraging third-party APIs to handle the translation.
noProblem The design is as required, following the appropriate patterns.
noProblem As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.
noProblem It is sound.
noProblem some additional tests can be added
noProblem Looking at the design there seems to be high use of cohesion  and low coupling. It's good that all the changes are restricted to the routes.rb and config/locales files so that the resulting changes won't be messy and ruin the rest of the system. Also this helps in refactoring if needed in the future as there will be limited number of files to be changed.
noProblem Yes, the design appears to be as simple as possible. The team has mentioned what needs to be done and how they plan to implement it.
noProblem The changes have been explained well enough to minimize the complexity. The implementation seems extremely clear.
noProblem Yes, simple straightforward solution.  
noProblem Simple and easy to understand steps.
noProblem Yes. Only view files are involving since this topic is about changing the language.
noProblem The document does contain a test plan which can definitely be extended to incorporate certain negative test cases.
noProblem The design appears to be very simple. The team has avoided unnecessary complications by adhereing to the Rails Internationalization guide. They have also avoided making unnecessary changes to many files and kept the changes to the minimum number of files required.
noProblem They did include a test plan. It would be better if they also test the instructor side.
noProblem The design is really crisp and easy to understand. One can clearly understand the problem statement and the proposed solution for the same. The design document is properly structured as well.
noProblem Yes the current design looks simple and wholesome. Seems they have done a good job in implementing understanding how rails internationalization works. Good job   
noProblem No visualization or diagrams are necessary.
noProblem The visualization clearly and effectively conveys the translation capability which the project proposes to provide to Expertiza.
noProblem Yes, the provided diagrams deliver sufficient information about the implementation.
noProblem The necessary visual inputs to aid explanation are present.
noProblem mock UIs screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required changes.
noProblem Test plan is as simple as required for the problem statement in question.
noProblem Design doc includes the test plan but more detail on negative test cases would have been better.
noProblem The team has provided a code snippet which includes solution to their problem statement. They have described the code and their proposed changes
noProblem A testplan that covers the entire functionality has been devised, it seems sufficient to test the change.
noProblem The test plan is compatible with the problem statement. 
noProblem Test plan have been shown clearly and tests are easy to understand.
noProblem Yup, because it only tests the ability to change the language.
noProblem The design includes a brief test plan that lists three scenarios namely- the regular steps to update Course page to Hindi; checking if Edit Assignment page has also been translated and checking if other pages are translated. Some more test cases like checking if the change in language is reflected from a student login could have been included. The authors specify that Rspec and Capybara is used for testing the new feature.
noProblem As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.   
noProblem Yes, simple straightforward solutions.
noProblem Great use of mock ups and UML diagrams. It makes understanding the issues easier. Looks like a great amount of thought has gone into making it. 
noProblem Yes, the authors have nicely explained the changes to be made. This includes, the flow diagrams, UML diagrams and many of the screenshots. Good work team. Suggestion: Could include screenshots, if any, of the test plans implemented.
noProblem The design looks good. All the issues are stated and addressed nicely.
noProblem The design does not seem that complex. The team has clearly mentioned the issues and the way to go about it.  
noProblem The visualization is great. All the flow diagrams and required screenshots are in place as required.
noProblem Yes, they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection. They have not only given proper UML diagrams and the like, but they are yet to implement the code and showcase in the "UML Diagram for Review" section.     
noProblem   The design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the use case diagram in which the users are student and instructor and the data base is where the actions are stored in the database and the retrieved from the same for the case of reviews information.  Also, they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the Application Flow section so as to elucidate the problem statement. 
noProblem Yes, the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the review section. 
noProblem Yes, the diagrams are clear to show how the system works. They have even gone a step ahead to show how they have thought of resolving the problem at each and every step of the Expertiza review section and the message popups they receive for the same. 
noProblem Yes, they have a working test plan in mind and also they have thought of the ways in which they are going to test the various edge cases for the various issues at hand.
noProblem The team has included all the details required to implement the given requirement. The wiki has complete details related to requirements , analysis of current designs and changes required to achieve the required functionality. overall great job !  The team did a great work in analyzing the issues and designing solutions for the issues.

noProblem I understand what the team is supposed to do to the expertiza system.
noProblem It was weird that two of the bugs they were assigned don't exist, but that's not the team's fault.
noProblem This team consistently uses great diagrams that add to their documentation's clarity significantly.
noProblem The tests are really in depth for each issue the team will be fixing.
noProblem After the first review, the design has improved significantly. The proposed design clearly defines the changes being made by the team.
noProblem They have a paragraph saying what they are going to do, but it could be broken up into parts with images for better understanding
noProblem The authors have explained well what changes they wish to make and how they plan to implement those changes. I would suggest them to add more details like, "where do they store the list of responses more than the notification threshold". Overall good job.
noProblem A format of the proposed email to be sent would be helpful
noProblem Yes, they include this part in the Proposed Solutions field. It would be better if they use visualization to let the readers better understand the flow.
noProblem The team has provided a code snippet which includes solution to their problem statement. They have described the code and their proposed changes
noProblem I know exactly what this team is doing.
noProblem Yes, the problem statement and the proposed changes have been clearly explained.
noProblem The design has improved and updates has been done and it is easy to comprehend the changes to be made to the system.
noProblem There has been a significant improvement in the level of details provided. The author can further improve the document by providing the details of the design pattern to be used.
noProblem Design is okay
noProblem Design does seem to be sound, but complex. As mentioned in the earlier review, I am unsure if looping over each review is the correct thing to do or not. Maybe the team discussed this with the mentor and decided against it as no new information has been added in the document. If so, I would only suggest the team to include the complexity of the design in the document.
noProblem The design seems workable. Maybe they can come up a more sound design. For example, they can try many ways to define the notification limit.
noProblem By looking at the flow-charts and UML diagrams submitted by the team, their solution appears to be sound.
noProblem It seems as though this team's approach was well designed.
noProblem The design seems to be pretty straightforward.
noProblem The design is simple, although it could be better if it has more concrete examples.
noProblem Yes, the design is as simple as it can get. Understanding the principle is not hard. But making it simple should also not make it costly. Good work to the team if the instructors were looking for something this simple :)
noProblem The team has provided diagrams that make it easier for the reader to understand the workflow of the system and the changes that they have proposed to implement the solution.
noProblem The way the team plans to loop through each review to calculate a review score seems slightly more complex than necessary, but I agree with them taking this apporach as it will allow them to break down the reason why the scores are different.
noProblem The design does appear to be simple, as they have not planned to modify any of the existing methods. Their new method will interact with Response, AssignmentQuestionnaire model, and then link the assignment to the review in the email. However, they have not mentioned if they have planned any data structure/variable to store the assignment link and pass it on to the method where email notification will be sent. But, i suppose that storing it in a variable will suffice. 
noProblem The design and application flow appear to be as simple as possible, as well as the proposed code changes snippet provided.

noProblem Yes the approach is explained in detail.
noProblem Yes. The design is clear and the details are succinct.
noProblem The authors have adequately mentioned the desired changes in the approach and design section. The problem statement gives the gist of the issue at hand including adding feature to make student's reviews public.

noProblem Yes, Design shows a good amount of work to be done. Team is not using any design pattern.  
noProblem The design is proper.
noProblem Confronted with a tricky problem in creating links between different assignments across semesters to aggregate the reviews, I was really impressed with the way they plan to accomplish this feature.
noProblem I am not convinced with the "similar_assignments" table schema. For an assignment Ax, there is a foreign key that points to an assignment Ay such that Ax can be an assignment in say 2018 and Ay can be the same assignment in 2017. But what if one of the reviews from assignment Az which was in 2015 was really good and we need to include that as a sample and also include another review from Aw from 2016 as a sample.  According my understanding, this above requirement cannot be met with the current DB table design. Something that the team may look into.
noProblem The design and fixes are coherently described and are logical to be implemented for the given functionality. The issues are stated properly allowing the reader to understand it and the fixes suggested are enlisted in an appropriate manner.
noProblem Simple design
noProblem The steps taken by the team to implement the functionality is very clear and detailed. as stated above, the approach discusses the  step wise action that the team is going to take for the implementation.
noProblem Design doc is not complex and every section of the menu explains the itself with simplest term possible.
noProblem The design is concised and clear. Only makes the required changes and introduces no duplications.
noProblem For as difficult a problem as linking assignments from one year to the next is, they present an admirably simple design.
noProblem It is simple enough and also achieves the required features
noProblem The design looks simplified but there might be some edge cases that needs handling such as - What if a student makes his/her review public, this review is selected by the power user to create a sample and then the student wishes to make the review private?
noProblem The design makes it clear to understand the procedure adapted to realize the goal. The authors have made it a point to describe the tasks carried out in a simpler manner allowing the reader to realize the approach towards the issue. 
noProblem The team has represented the workflow through the UML diagrams which is very helpful to understand the flow of the requirement with multiple actors involved in the system. However, it would have been more helpful if they could add the design flow diagrams to explain the database design changes they are suggesting to be done. The new table they are suggesting to make and  the fields they would map to could be shown through a entity relationship diagram which will make it easy for the end user to understand the attributes and the relationship of different entities involved due to the functionality change.
noProblem The team has not used any class diagram.
noProblem some mock UI where this is going to be implemented would be helpful
noProblem I like the Use Case Diagram, but I would like class diagrams or a database visualization too, so it's easier to understand how the cross-course assignment linking will work.
noProblem There is one box for both review controller and assignment controller. A better picture of how they handle each event differently would have been helpful.
noProblem No test cases
noProblem The test plan section properly describes the flow that needs to be followed by each actor involved in the process. This could be enhanced either by providing a flow diagram or adding certain test case snippets for the scenarios.
noProblem The flowcharts included in the design document clearly explain the changes that need to be done.
noProblem The design document includes proper visualization. It included appropriate flow charts and screenshots which made it easier to understand the design document and the project.
noProblem They provide pictures of their sound waves.
