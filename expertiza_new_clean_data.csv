Requesting to GIT Link to verify the same,1161045,1,8076
"The code follows ""good Ruby and Rails coding practice"" from my point of view.",1156949,-1,8076
Have used DRY principles. The code has good readability and good naming conventions are followed. Have grouped similar functionalities into classes so that it is modularized. Have used iterators such as each instead of for and while.,1163554,-1,8076
UI/UX is awesome and intuitive. Read me file is also well described.,1171369,-1,8076
The README is empty and does not contain the admin account information. It's hard to navigate around the interface and determine where all the functionality is.,1157938,1,8076
"UI looks nice but I found the it to be a bit confusing. The relation between User, House Hunter and Realtor is not apparent. It would helpful if it could be explained in detail in the README file.",1173259,1,8076
The interface was simple. Some of the fields input were not mentioned like for creating house,1158166,1,8076
Requesting to GIT Link to verify the same. But i downloaded the Zipped file to see if there is admin credentials in README file and it was not there.,1161047,1,8076

Requesting to GIT Link to verify the same,1161100,1,8076
Yes you have the tests written.,1157004,-1,8076

Looks like the team has committed the project as a whole. Bug fixes are done incrementally.,1163610,1,8076
"The project has successfully named it's varables and function names according to the principle. They are understandable form what the mean. But the project lacks any documentation internally, as well as a proper external readme file. Lack of code documentation makes it tough for the reviewer to make sense of the code. Apart from that, the design of the database schema isn't normalized to much extent, which makes data entries redundant.",1173485,1,8082
The model and controller are well designed. Each method covers a single functionality! Good job,1157436,-1,8082
The MVC structure is completed. and basic functions have been finished.,1168235,-1,8082
"From what I see it looks like code we have seen in class. Although in the model classes, they don't have any associations between models.",1156539,1,8082
"The code itself appears to be very clean. The lack of scaffolding (or the stripped down scaffolding that it presents) means there's a lot less dead code in the files. All the indentation and variable names appear to follow convention as well. This cleanliness, on further inspection, appear to stem from the fact that the application frequently does not support needed functionality. The code that's there is clean though.",1156449,1,8082
"Overall, the code looks fine. Good code is self-documenting - So, your code could be improved by adding comments in all required places. Make use of different logging options provided by ROR and avoid using ""puts"" in code.",1164130,1,8082
The Code is structured as per basic rails norms. The CRUD operations operations actions could have followed the usual norms than custom actions defined. The routes config could have been more efficiently defined using match than defining each routes separately.,1171481,1,8082
"All users have their own model controllers. The code is following Ruby on Rails standards but there are some debug ""puts"" that should be removed.",1161159,1,8082
"The user interface is very simple, clear and straightforward. But it lacks depth where it should have been extensive. For example, after signing up for the first time, the user is directed by to the login page to login again. This is not very user friendly, and is rather redundant. One must automatically sign in after creating an account. Also, the application should deduce whether I'm a realtor or a househunter or an admin from the email ID i entered. I should atleast now have to specify for househunter or realtor about my role.",1173487,1,8082
The UI is basic as of now. The 'show profile' link is broken.,1157438,1,8082
"the interface is good, clean and very easy to use.",1168237,-1,8082
They are simple links to pages which does tell you where to go so it's fine.,1156541,-1,8082
"All the buttons which do what they say they do are quite good. Quite reasonably, I can click on these buttons and the expected behavior occurs. It's a little weird to have to select whether I want to log in as a house hunter, a realtor, or the admin at the login screen, and that it doesn't work without selecting the right user type.   Unfortunately, many buttons do not do what they say, or redirect the application to a dead page. Here are the functionalities which do not work: 1. Attempting to delete Real Estate Company makes you view Real Estate Company detailed info. Inquiries do the same. 2. Attempting to 'show' anything that's not a real estate company throws a 406. 3. As a realtor, I tried to Update/add company information and my change was rejected. 4. The List a House form has 'create company' as its submit button.    There are also many things I expected to be able to do that there were not buttons or links for.",1156451,1,8082
The UI is elementary but intuitive. The links have long descriptive names,1171483,-1,8082
Yes it is deployed on Heroku.,1161161,-1,8082
"The login / signup module seems to be well tested of all the other models and controllers in the program. But this module has a drawback. It deals with three tables, the realtors, the househunters and the admin. Due to this kind of segmentation, there is a repetition of data i the database, if any user would like to signup as both. Also, it would make it difficult to handle complexity as the application grows. According to me, its better to atleast cascade the tables of realtors and house hunters into one.  The other functionalities are not wholly implemented, only the CRUD operations related to those are implemented, hence not much could be reviewed about testing.",1173540,1,8082
"The project needs validations on all fields (I was able to enter random values in email address, mobile number fields). Some of the additional functionalities were missing (filter inquiry, see who has added my house to their inquiry list etc). The project is well connected and navigation is easy. Overall it looks very clean and intuitive! ",1157491,1,8082
I don't think the test has been finished. the controller test file is basic empty and the same empty in the model test file.,1168290,1,8082
"No, not really. No user type has all the functionality in this review's check boxes, much less all the functionality specified in the project description. Manual inspection of the test folder reveals that all the model and controller tests are empty, as are the fixtures.",1156504,1,8082
"No, testing is not covered yet.",1164185,1,8082
"Yes, the team seems to have tested their UsersController completely that handles login, logout and other user signin validations",1171536,-1,8082
Admin and Realtor's functionalities are partially working. Many other features need to implement. ,1161214,1,8082
"The project only has 3 commits, all on  a single day. So yes, it can't be said that the project was implemented or developed over a period of time. ",1173541,1,8082
The code was presumable uploaded in the end (pushed from another repo) and hence I could not see any regular commits.,1157492,-1,8082
"I can not see the completed devolepment procedure, the only commit in the github is happend on Monday, the week of 9/30.",1168291,1,8082
No. They only have 3 commits and 1 branch so that means they waited until the last minute to do thi,1156595,1,8082
"I cannot appraise this because I do not believe they did their development in the linked repo. There is only one commit, where all the functionality was added. I am inclined to say the team was not actively developing over the project period.",1156505,1,8082
"In total, there are only 3 commits done!",1164186,-1,8082
"No, according to the Git history, there has not been no changes pushed after Oct 1st",1171537,1,8082

Most of the practices have been followed,1159690,-1,8055
"The ruby source code appears to follow RoR conventions, and uses a few Rails associations. The directory names and project structure appear to follow good RoR MVC conventions. Source code is organized and uncluttered too.",1167665,-1,8055

"Very good structure, readable and names are very relevant to the functionality",1172222,-1,8055
The code is written really well.,1165941,-1,8055

"The UI is mostly easy to use, but the README is nearly undocumented.",1167667,1,8055
Good design and easy to use.,1167316,-1,8055
The deployed link is not accessible. The readme file describes the process for just admin login but not for the consequent steps. ,1162218,1,8055
The UI is straight forward and easy to use. The implementation of the menu bar makes it look better. Though there is a scope for improvement. The admin link in the Readme file is not working.,1164838,1,8055
"nice user interface, good use layouts. but unable to log in as admin,",1172224,1,8055
UI is nicely done.  There are a few things that can be improved:  1. Clear all / list all houses field once a search parameter has been given 2. Do not show receiver object id in inquiries. Maybe something more useful.,1165943,1,8055
Controller has been tested  ,1159745,-1,8055

"The team has added functionality for login through google sign-in, but I couldn't verify it's working.  ",1162271,1,8055
the realtor and house hunter controllers work as desired in most cases though there are some cases which need to be addressed. There is a need to validate the real estate creation form.,1164891,1,8055
extensive testing was done,1172277,-1,8055
Yes.,1165996,-1,8055
Team was active thoughout the process,1159746,-1,8055
"No, the majority of the work was pushed on 09/29. It is an impressive product if they got all of this done in the past week.",1167721,-1,8055
There are many commits which are divided almost equally between all teammmates,1164892,-1,8055
yes about 75  commits were done,1172278,-1,8055
Code commit frequency is good.,1165997,-1,8055
The code is very well written and arranged to be easily understandable. No extraneous code or unused code visible. DRY principles have been implemented very well.,1159234,-1,8022
Very clearly code,1167950,-1,8022
"I think it does pretty well to follow the ""good Ruby and Rails coding practices"". It is elegant and follows the DRY code approach.",1176815,1,8022
This team has followed the basic structure followed in every ruby on rails application which made my task easier to access files and understand their logic. Properly described README file and also one additional pdf given with application was enough to give me proper understanding of the modules.,1176576,-1,8022
ReadMe file contains enough information to understand the project implementation basics.,1159236,-1,8022
Please directly tall users where to sign up.,1167952,-1,8022
The user interface is very intuitive and easy to use. It is very well explained in the README file. The steps to run the code are described as well.,1176817,-1,8022

"Yes, from what I could see, they have done well in testing at least one model and one controller.",1176870,-1,8022
"Team has perfectly implemented major modules and also they have implemented the extra credit portion. I tried to login with invalid credentials or some invalid password-email-phone lengths: but there were validations. Hence, they have perfectly focused on this parts too and tested it.   I believe this has implemented a through test of at least one module and controller.",1176631,-1,8022
Several linear commits with good explanations available.,1159290,-1,8022
"Tem has properly used Git and only pushed the changes when necessary and also, consistently throughout the project period.",1176632,-1,8022
Well written code.,1163845,-1,8071
Not a lot of code to begin with but whatever is there seems by coding practice norms. Most of the code seems to be commented,1160396,-1,8071
The code base is very minimum. Many functionalities are not implemented.,1166757,1,8071
"Yes partially, the code has the parameters not well defined for all only one conceivable user seemingly admin and that too is doubtful to have the correct MVC Layout.  For instance, they seem to have created separate MVC architectures for Admins, Companies and Users only. This goes to show that they are lacking in a layered approach on access and privileges.  Also, the code is written in a reasonably clean and formatted style with the variable definitions to be self-explanatory of the functionalities they perform in most cases for whichever few roles defined. ",1162159,1,8071
"The code is properly written with good Ruby practices, however, no comments are mentioned.",1176019,1,8071
"It seems as though you have an awful lot of controllers that are supposed to have something to do with authentication that either don't get used or don't have any code in them. Other than that, the project looks organized like a Ruby on Rails project should be. There is a lot of code that is hard to follow, and I can't discern its purpose in several controllers.",1170911,1,8071
"Yes, the code follows good Ruby and Rails coding practices as the models, views and controllers are well defined",1159166,-1,8071
Readme not well defined,1163847,1,8071
"The login opens the user page which has which has 5 ""back"" links for some reason and they do not do anything. No common home page for all the list views. Have to all the list views go from user pages. List of companies is not in tabulated form, thus very difficult to read",1160398,1,8071
I cannot create any hunter or realtor accounts.,1166759,1,8071
This UI is pretty good. It's fairly intuitive to follow. The only thing I'd recommend is to have a link to the signup page on your welcome screen.,1170913,1,8071

"It is not a very intuitive user interface because the ease of navigation not achieved in it due to the ill defined 'db' folders and the routes.rb file in git hub makes the session linkage a bit hard to follow.  Also, I fail to understand the structural flow of the program even after logging in after signing up. So, I get easily confused on what to do. Sign up is not validated for any functionality be it user or admin or realtor and we don't know what to do and that are we admins or any other user. Privilege separation has not been done. Also, the README barely resolve the dilemma and is of minimal help to us to follow the steps. ",1162161,1,8071

"No, that doesn't seem to be the case since, it has been a very jumpy approach and also the functionality of only a basic login has been added. So, if adding the bare login and sign up is considered as an MVC architecture then they have surely built a bare backbone of it. ",1162214,1,8071
The team hasn't yet implemented any proper testing,1176074,1,8071
"the User model has been tested, although I can't say it is thorough at this point, as it only tests the validity that is already required by the model.",1170966,1,8071
"The admin functionality is tested well, however there are some fields like validations of phone number which are yet to be tested or improved upon",1159221,-1,8071

"There are only ten commits and that too only from one account, which means it has only been done by one individual and not a team.",1160452,1,8071
I did see updates and commits 15 hours ago.,1166813,-1,8071
"Yes, added the working functionalities timely.",1162386,-1,8071
"Yes, seems to be so the case in effect the last commit being just 5 hrs ago. But what changes against each file have been made is not clear hence its a bit unclear as to the extent and the number of changes made. Moreover, the amount of subject matter and the number of sessions or models are far too less to be implementing any changes as such. ",1162215,1,8071
The team has been pushing commits in a way that shows they have been making consistent progress on the project.,1170967,-1,8071
"Yes, they have around 21 commits.",1159222,-1,8071
I could see commits by only one person. Need team contribution.,1175505,1,8071
Most files seem to be following good coding practices.,1160931,-1,8080
The readme file is well constructed. MVC files are properly made and easy to navigate. DB migrations can be seen easily as well. Overall good job done on this part.,1173542,-1,8080
The app was designed according to the ruby conventions and coding practices. The necessary authorizations are used along with gems to handle user session. Some models do not have the complete validations but the validations in place are using the ruby practices. The active record and association between models is also used in the project. ,1158221,1,8080
Fairly good coding practices followed.,1169463,-1,8080
"UI is easy to use, a suggestion would be to display tables of data better, with better spacing (the list houses page for example has the columns cramped up together)",1160933,1,8080
"The User Interface is very intuitive. The idea to add a field for preferred contact is very smart and relevant. Displaying the number of registered users, however, seems irrelevant to the house hunter and realtor. Perhaps this can be a function of the admin account where it would be more relevant.",1169123,1,8080
The UI is well built as well. Specially the navigation bar at the top is a delight in terms of User experience.,1173544,-1,8080
"No, the README file tells me what I should do to test in local computer, and does not offer admin's information or any instruction of how to operate when login to the website.",1173829,1,8080
"Yes the UI is pretty smooth and a person can navigate freely. However, in some cases there is no ""back"" link in the web-page, so the user has to use browser navigation to go to the previous page.",1168294,1,8080
The design lacks dynamic paging for different users. all the links are visible to all the users and upon clicking the links an error comes that you are not authorized to perform the action. Ideally only relevant links should be visible to the user. It confuses the user regaring the actions he/she can perform. The user needs to perform all the actions visible in the UI to know what are the actions relevant for him/her. The readme file also is not well described about the actions that can be performed by the user. The readme file currently lacks any relevant information.,1158223,1,8080
"I could only check househunter UI. Since I could not find admin and realtor code on github either, I believe you are yet to implement the functionality.  The UI I viewed was easy to use. Further site is responsive and incorporates several new features like requiring password for editing the profile. I guess that was work of a gem, but either way, good work!",1169465,1,8080
Yes. The controller and model for handling inquiries have been thoroughly tested.,1173597,-1,8080
Extra credit features have not been implemented. No google sign-in and no email replies ,1168347,1,8080
The default testcases are present for some controllers. All the functionalities test are not present for the controllers. The models are not testes.,1158276,0,8080
Could not find custom tests.,1169518,1,8080
"With a total of 77 commits, the team has actively pushed changes to the project. Although not all commits are labeled very accurately, it is still easy to comprehend the pushed changes.",1169177,1,8080
"The team kept on pushing changes throughout the project period, showing timely contributions from each team member. In fact, by looking at the commits, each team member was probably assigned a dedicated module to work on, which always works well to create such a big application.",1173598,-1,8080
"Yes, through the commit record, I can see that this team has been keeping pushing their changes.",1173883,-1,8080
"There are more than 70 commits , and they have been working continously",1168348,-1,8080
There were regular commits during the course of the project.,1158277,-1,8080
Fairly frequent commits to GIT.,1169519,-1,8080
"Just one table is used for all users. Therefore there is no distinction among the admin, realtor and the house_hunter",1165805,1,8034
"Not much functionality is available. Of what is available, however, the code does follow ""good Ruby and Rails coding practices""",1158881,-1,8034
The code there seems to be well organized. But the problem is that many functionalities are missing and there aren't too much code in models and controllers.,1167200,1,8034
Code is using Basic Ruby on Rails Structure which by default provides the CRUD Functionalty. But no details of Admin login provided. Also some of the models seem to be missing.,1159804,1,8034
The code is well written. I noticed the controller for inquiries is well written but it is unclear how to access all those functionalities from the front-end.,1173200,1,8034
"The code is very neat and easy to read, but i can tell it is the auto generated code from scaffold. ",1176190,-1,8034
User interface should not show the location Users#dashboard   Find me in app/views/users/dashboard.html.erb,1172167,1,8034
"The application has bare minimum functionalities of what was required. A user signup and login has been implemented, but no information about what type of user has signed up/ logged in is available. ReadMe file is the default and no changes have been made to it.",1158883,1,8034
"The application portal is same for all the 3 users. Therefore all users have been given same permissions.   ReadMe does not contain admin credentials . Hence, can't test admin functionalities",1165807,1,8034
No admin account provided. No user role selections. Seems to be an incomplete project. Looks like they use scaffolding to generate the templates but didn't fill in the necessary code.,1167202,1,8034
"UI displays session info, file paths and # tags. Could be improved with little efforts",1159806,1,8034
"No information for admin login credentials provided anywhere. Under signing-up, no option to sign up as a realtor or a hunter is given. They should be able to do that because otherwise the functionalities aren't being differentiated for a hunter and a realtor. ",1173202,1,8034
"The application is deployed on Heroku, and the user interface is easy to use.",1176192,-1,8034
"The implementation can only log one type of user on and even though not specified, the user has all controls so it can be assumed its an admin. Admins can signup as well.",1158936,1,8034
There is just one user role in the current submission. Unable to test the admin functionality,1165860,1,8034
No roles implemented. ,1167255,-1,8034
Basic Tests are present. Not custom tests though,1159859,-1,8034
"No, none of the controllers or models have been tested.",1173255,1,8034
"Actually i did find some auto generated test code for the controllers, but i don't think it is a thoroughly test. And there is no test code for the model.",1176245,1,8034
total of 10 commits are visible on got but do not show a linear increment in the work done.,1158937,1,8034
Yes. Good effort in case of pushing changes,1165861,-1,8034
No updates since 6 days ago,1167256,-1,8034

"I looked through their github commits log, and found that their first commit is on Sep 28,2018. Maybe their just began to do the project on Sep 28?",1176246,1,8034
Well written code.,1163845,-1,8112
Not a lot of code to begin with but whatever is there seems by coding practice norms. Most of the code seems to be commented,1160396,1,8112
The code base is very minimum. Many functionalities are not implemented.,1166757,1,8112
"Yes partially, the code has the parameters not well defined for all only one conceivable user seemingly admin and that too is doubtful to have the correct MVC Layout.  For instance, they seem to have created separate MVC architectures for Admins, Companies and Users only. This goes to show that they are lacking in a layered approach on access and privileges.  Also, the code is written in a reasonably clean and formatted style with the variable definitions to be self-explanatory of the functionalities they perform in most cases for whichever few roles defined. ",1162159,1,8112
"The code is properly written with good Ruby practices, however, no comments are mentioned.",1176019,1,8112
"It seems as though you have an awful lot of controllers that are supposed to have something to do with authentication that either don't get used or don't have any code in them. Other than that, the project looks organized like a Ruby on Rails project should be. There is a lot of code that is hard to follow, and I can't discern its purpose in several controllers.",1170911,1,8112
"Yes, the code follows good Ruby and Rails coding practices as the models, views and controllers are well defined",1159166,-1,8112

Evenly committed code during the project duration.,1169986,-1,8035
The team pushed changes frequently.,1156323,-1,8035
The code is very well written and arranged to be easily understandable. No extraneous code or unused code visible. DRY principles have been implemented very well.,1159234,-1,8042
The code is very well written and organised. All the framework conventions have been followed such as the naming conventions. Comments have been added at appropriate places which improved the readability.,1171709,-1,8103
yes. code is written properly. followed dry principle. added comments where possible. followed mvc with rails framework.,1173770,-1,8103
"First of all, this website doesn't work at all. I can't sign up as any role. And I also can't get admin's info from README file, which is an auto-generated file.",1168007,1,8103

yes. User Interface is good and easy to access.,1173772,-1,8103
"No, the README file is an auto-generated file, and there is no details in it.",1168009,1,8103
A little confusing as there are two sign up forms one under the other and it is not clear what they are for.,1168123,1,8103
Only the registration page is working and the interface is quite confusing as it has sign-up for both realtor and hunter on the same page which is bit confusing.,1159350,1,8103

"Team has tested hounse hunter functionalities but not admin and realtor functionalities. Register page asks us to put credentials twice. We are able to register for house hunter only irrespective of choosing any field (house hunter or realtor). Hence I am not able to login into realtor account. Also could not find any credentials for admin, realtor or house hunter in readme file.  Hence not able to login into admin account also.   New link provided in document is not working. If would be great it team could check the link and come back.",1173825,1,8103
I don't think the test part of this website is working.,1168062,1,8103
You guys haven't implemented unit test for your project yet. ,1161486,1,8103
The house hunter model seemed to work according to most of the tasks mentioned. Not for the admin and realtor ones. Was unable to login as admin. Was unable t signup as realtor. ,1156390,1,8103
Excellent commit history. Contributions from all team members could be seen.,1171765,-1,8103
Yes I could see many push requests on the github. Hence concluding team is pushing their changes periodically.,1173826,-1,8103
"I find few changing records from github, but I can't show the process of development.",1168063,1,8103
"Yes, the team kept pushing changes throughout the project period",1168177,-1,8103
There was consistent commits with a spike in between when probably most development happened,1175676,-1,8103
"looking at your commit history, you guys started it on Saturday when the submission was Monday.",1161487,-1,8103
"The website did not seem to work at first. Now I was able to access it. I also noticed some features that were included in the meantime like testing by adding house hunters. Overall, the team did work on updating the site functionalities. ",1156391,-1,8103
Only basic operation is available. Need to add lots of functionality. ,1163224,1,8060
"The Git repo shows total of 15 commits. Although majority of the places Ruby Standards have been followed but at some places variables names such as (househunter_url) does not show any relavancy or understandidng to the reader. If the variable is pointing to a function or belongs to, for example it can be house_hunt_xyz. Overall I think good standards are being followed. ",1164472,-1,8060
The code has good style and recognizable convention over configuration. There are some line spacing issues however.,1177508,1,8171
"Yes we can see many pushes on git. Hence , they have updated code.",1177710,-1,8171
Timely commits and elaborated readme file.,1167143,-1,8171
"The models , views and controllers are well created.   1)      You can seed data for the admin into your production environment. The command to do this on heroku is heroku run rails db:seed.

"Everything seems good. You can move constants to a separate file and use them . For example where you are comparing ==""admin"" or ==""realtor"". You can either move them to a separate file or in database and use it.",1173143,1,8171
"The code is clear and concise, it does follow good Ruby and Rails coding practices.",1162080,-1,8171
"Yes, the code does follow Ruby and Rails practices to an extent, as I can see the use of many helper methods in the code.",1159109,-1,8171
Stress is given to MVC architecture. But proper comments in the code section can simplify the code understanding for other users.,1168893,1,8171
The bulk of the code I deciphered was auto-generated via scaffold but the code that is changed follows good practices.,1164358,1,8171
Most files seem to be following good Ruby and Rails practices.,1162678,-1,8028
Did a good job using forms to stay dry with the edit and new pages. Some more comments especially in the models would have been helpful to understand why certain validations were chosen. The use of JSON to store and recall in views was clever.,1174197,-1,8028
"This application has the layout expected of a Rails application. However, not enough information was included in the README file about installation.",1168485,1,8028
yes. It is well written and they managed to follow DRY principle.,1164016,-1,8028
Code follows the basic CRUD structure given by Rails and neatly explains what is being performed. The notices nicely explains the user what is happening. The db schema is designed to incorporate most of the requirements.,1158311,-1,8028

The readme file is still the default provided by rails. I don't have access to an admin login and when I try to sign up for a new account(realtor or hunter) I get redirected to a webpage telling me that something went wrong. The small ammount of the UI that does exist(login and create account) seems easy enough to understand but it appears that without logging in I cannot see any other links.,1174199,1,8028
Yes user interface is easy to use on the first page.,1164018,-1,8028
Readme.md file has no details on how to login and the signup pages for house hunter and realtors are not working. So no way of navigating the application fully.,1158313,1,8028

Readme file doesn't have any information. Not able to login with admin credentials.,1159749,1,8028
Could not test UI because links for signing up are broken.,1170340,1,8028

"The user interface has a bare bones look and feel but is intuitive overall. The inquiries list is hard to find for the admin, and the links below the tables could be placed at the top of the screen to improve the UX. The inquiry component of the app had awkward navigation, particularly for the realtor. This is also awkward for the house hunter. Only one link is needed up top.",1177510,1,8171
Sign-up for realtors and admin gives application error. ,1167145,1,8171
The user interface is pretty intuitive. Few things like the create house functionality is breaking on heroku and giving an application error.,1162275,1,8171
They have attached 2 other files saying what all they have implemented.,1173145,-1,8171
Everything was described properly in the README file.,1162082,-1,8171
"UI is simple to follow. Enhancements mentioned below can simplify various tasks 1. Preferred contact method can be drop down with ""text, mail, phone"" options. 2. User role can be drop down with ""buyer and realtor"".",1168895,1,8171
"The user interface is average.  The good parts I found about UI are: 1. Error messages (while registering a new admin/house hunter/realtor/house/company) were helpful. 2. Front-end checks like mail and phone number size and type etc have been used properly. 3. Dropdown for companies while registering houses, for houses while submitting inquiruies etc are properly implemented and easy to use. However, several very small changes would make the UI much better: 1. Allow a drop-down when signing up as roles 2. Add inquire a house or add a new house to interest list etc functionalituies at the top. If house list gets a few hundred rows long, user must scroll all the way down to access the functionalities. 3. Add message as to why login failed. Something as simple as ""Invalid credentials"" would suffice and let user know that the login is working but the password is incorrect.",1164360,1,8171
"No model tests were found, but a controller test was well tested.",1177563,1,8171
I could see testing done. I could see extra test cases added.,1177765,-1,8171
"I feel the user model is well tested. The link to houses broke through realtor role on heroku. This might just be a production issue and might work well locally in the development environment. I recommend checking the heroku logs and fixing this error. Due to this error, I could not create any house for listing. Overall, I feel it is a good job and you have managed to implement most of the functionalities.  One suggestion would be :  1)      When I try to sign-up as a user, I have to fill up the role type. This is not intuitive for a user as the user does not know what kinds of roles and their format(case sensitivity, data type etc) expected by your system. I would suggest either give a drop down for this or checkboxes which will be easy for a user to use.",1162328,1,8171

"Team has perfectly implemented major modules and also they have implemented the extra credit portion. I tried to login with invalid credentials or some invalid password-email-phone lengths: but there were validations.

"I'm docking some points here because Heroku doesn't appear to work. I think some malicious reviewer deleted the admin and the real estate company, and surprise! If a company doesn't exist, it doesn't let any user sign up.    Please re-seed your database so I can test your app.  ",1156894,1,8088

No validations are added (I can choose role no. 5 for signup), and no error messages have been provided. Passwords are in plain text. In some cases, wrong notices are displayed - create user with wrong info gives ""User account was successfully created. AAA!"" which is incorrect as user was not actually created.  Back to your page links do not work",1168838,1,8061

Every controller serves a specific purpose and the use of a common welcome_controller and its associated views has again modularised the code for easy extensibility. ",1164529,-1,8056

Basic Practices were followed Reusability of code is maintained and the code is well intended,1156109,-1,8125
"Lot of work is done, good job.  Few suggestions from my end,  (1) Tests not implemented for both model and controller (2) I do see   <%= form.check_box(:role_ids, {:multiple => :true, :checked => @user.roles.map { |role| role.id }.include?(role.id) }, role.id, false) %> but roles are not visible in UI (3) Though images are uploaded , in house profile it is not displayed, also as I understand multiple images for house are allowed hence its incorrect to use   has_one_attached :image_path. (4) Validations for models such a House are missing  (5) Its a good coding tech to add  : params.require in controllers  (6) In UI it is good to add in tables so that all fields are aligned  (7) you have before_action :authenticate_user! but in the controller tests I do not see login as part the tests.          ",1161716,1,8125

Each model/controller/view has a specific role which has not been repeated in other parts of the code.   I am giving 3/5 because 1. The code would have better readability if sufficient amount of comments are included in the code. Also, if the role of each model/controller/view is documented in the code file at the beginning then other contributors may feel easy to follow the code. 2.

Well structured code using MVC pattern.  Couldn't find admin credentials mentioned on readme. ,1162504,1,8078
the github code repository is concise and well maintained. The code base follows goo Ruby and Rails coding practices. The MVC architecture skeleton is implemented in an elegant manner. The desired features need to be implemented and the security issues need to be fixed.,1173064,1,8078
You are following good ruby coding practices. For some places where you are comparing for example in login_controller.rb if params[:login][:email] == 'admin@admin' && params[:login][:password] == 'admin' You can use a constant file where you can write these 'admin@admin.com' and use that constant. Its not a good practice to write it like this. Otherwise everything seems good.,1162001,1,8078

"Overall the following things can be improved: 1) The primary key for the real estate company should be auto generated. This is done automatically by the rails framework, so maybe you can remove the code from the view which asks for the user to select the primary key while creating a company. 2) Whenever there is a reference to a foreign key in a model, you can validate and use that reference by following the format model_id, where model is the entity of your foreign key. Eg. If house has foreign key of realtor, realtor is the entity of your foreign key, hence you can reference the realtor as realtor_id in your house model. This is because rails follows convention over configuration, and this is the naming convention with respect to foreign keys.",1160874,-1,8060
Navigation between pages is not defined well. ,1165066,-1,8060
Login page is not available. Also back navigation from any page is not present. Very difficult for user to come back to the last page visited.,1163226,1,8060

"The user interface is done as it would be in a basic ruby application, which is good. There is no login functionality, this is mentioned in the README which was helpful. Some functionalities which could be improved are :  1)     1)  When I try to add a new house hunter from admin, I get a Contact Method is not included in the list error. As a user, I dont know what kind of values your system is expecting in this field, so it might help to probably provide a dropdown selection element and put in your values there. In this way, the user will always select a value which your system is expecting. If there are a finite number of values, you can just hard code them into the html element, else pick it up from the db and populate your dropdown as such. 2)      2) When I click on back from the new househunter url, I am directed to show all house hunters url. You could improve this by updating the link-to for this back button by providing it with the user_url, or you could detect which is the current user logged in (Realtor/House Hunter/ Admin) and accordingly redirect to that roles home page url.",1160876,1,8060
"The login page is not made. All the admins information is listed on the first page which should not be allowed. It was difficult to understand if I was under the admin's page, realtor's or hunter's page.",1173601,1,8060

" Yes, the source code follows expected RoR style. The directory names and project structure also follow RoR conventions. Good job!",1174311,-1,8025
The code base is very well written and commented. The code has been done with good coding practices. The only point to note would be to update the Readme to be more informative.,1172450,1,8025
Good Rails coding practice has been implemented. In Model as well Controller we can see variables names that shows the relation to overall module and model. ,1164893,-1,8025
"The user interface is nice. I suggest you move the search button in the houses screen to the left. Also, ""yes"" and ""no"" would probably be more user-friendly than ""true"" and ""false"" for the basement condition. The new user window was very intuitive and powerful. Note: I found a bug in this window: changing the admin account with ""REALTOR"" checked causes an error. The error screen was graceful, however. Also, please use radio buttons for ""HUNTER"" or ""REALTOR"", not checkboxes. Please also include the type of the user in the users window.",1169009,1,8025
The UI is quite good but the design can be improved. The application allows a realtor to add company details while signing up which does not make for great design. Without authentication no user should be allowed to perform any functionality.,1174541,1,8025
No CSS has been applied. Links are redirecting to pages instead of just performing the action,1159942,1,8025

" UI is easy to use, but not well described in the README. Please add brief Test Cases to demonstrate expected functionality.",1174313,1,8025
The interface is basic and no extra styling is done. But overall the web application is easy and intuitive to use. The Read me  file of the github repo should be updated to make it more   detailed to use.  ,1172452,1,8025

"While the team did push changes to the project, there are 95 commits which are unnecessary. Instead of pushing every change to the final project, the team could have combined a few of the changes and pushed them all at once to make for better record of the changes made.",1174595,1,8025
Teams looks fairly active but the project progress does not correspond to the number of commits made in the git repository,1159996,1,8025

"The user interface is quite intuitive to use. I had a very minor suggestion. I found a case where the go back link was missing and thus, I had to click on the dashboard link to go back. Ex. After I click on view companies, there's no go back link.  Overall, I feel you did a really good job. For example, while switching the role, you gave an option to edit the roles as well. As well as a delete account functionality. ",1158655,-1,8108
companies_controller along with a few other controllers are populated with the tests generated by scaffolding. No tests in models found.,1158708,1,8108

"The team has a proper concern on MVC model. Each model/controller/view has a specific role which has not been repeated in other parts of the code.   Still, I am giving 3/5 because 1. The project has neglected DRY principle in many of the instances. This has resulted in a bulkier code. 2. As many authors say, a code looks good if it appears like reading a novel. This appearance of a novel like look is missing in many places which can grab other user's attention. 3. The code would have better readability if sufficient amount of comments are included in the code. Also, if the role of each model/controller/view is documented in the code file at the beginning then other contributors may feel easy to follow the code.",1163281,1,8108
"The README file is developed to include all the necessary details about the project as a whole. Great work on documenting. The UI is simple with properly designed tabs. Few enhancements could include 1. The back button is missing in a few places which might be useful for easier navigation. 2. While creating a company, if size is modelled as a drop down to take a range of values then UI would be simpler.",1163283,1,8108
"The team has tested parts of different models, but none of the models is thoroughly tested for functionality verification.",1163336,1,8108
"I can see that there are multiple commits on a single day. This might imply that team members have worked remotely without using git. Suggestions: 1. Make complete use of git when working remotely. 2. Keep pushing changes periodically to avoid any code loss and to have a timeline of changes. 3. Commit message carries great importance for the first level of code change analysis. So this has to explain the changes to a decent extent. Commit messages in this repository is vague; if they are meaningful, it reduces some effort in analysing the code timeline.",1163337,1,8108

well done work except the lack of search  the README file and the UI is not so good  anyway It's a good work! ,1167835,1,8092
Only basic validations have been implemented. Tests generated through scaffold are available.,1159050,1,8092

(4) Validations for models such a House are missing  (5) Its a good coding tech to add  : params.require in controllers  (6) In UI it is good to add in tables so that all fields are aligned  (7) you have before_action :authenticate_user! but in the controller tests I do not see login as part the tests.          ",1161716,1,8117

"The database schema only consisted of the users table, and the CRUD functionalities on the MVC related to it. Due to the less amount of content to review, a proper justification for this question is a bit tough. Even though the amount of code was less, but it followed many of the good coding practices of ruby on rails, except a few. For example, he code lacked any sort of documentation or comments. It makes it tough for the reviewer or any other programmer to make sense of the code. But apart from that, the practices seemed fine. The variables were named appropriately, functions were named effectively, and the classes were defined definitely. ",1170101,1,8072

The title is prominently displayed as a header on the home page and subsequent pages to clearly indicate what this application is ""Real Estate manager"". The login and signup links are clear as to purpose; however, the intent in the presence of the words ""Hello World"" beside them is unclear. Additionally, the login and signup page functionalities are easily interpreted. I would suggest that the user profile actually display what kind of user they are rather than a number that only has meaning to the system, as well as, a log out link/button in the header for a user as he/she traversed your application. The README file only contains the fact that there is no pre-configured administrator. I would recommend including the suggested context from the Ruby generator and the project write up.",1161547,1,8072

"The database schema, especially for the login / signup functionality is very well implemented, and includes lots of features that weren't asked for at the first place. So the extra hard-work is very well appreciated. The db design is very cohesive and seems fool-proof. The rest of the programs and the functionalities follow most of the principles for good ruby on rails coding practices. But, the one thing I find missing was the lack of proper documentation within the code. Given the short time frame, not having extensive documentation and comments within the code is excusable, but there were certain points where I had to go through the whole code to realize what;s happening, which could have been avoided if there was proper commenting inside the code. ",1167086,1,8100
"Yes, the code has the parameters well defined for all the users and has the correct MVC Layout as expected.  For instance, they seem to have created separate MVC architectures for Houses, Inquiries, Interests, Companies and Users.

Good job done here! You have listed the features available to test.,1162623,-1,8100
"Admin credentials in README file not working therefore not able to test admin part. UI is confusing, there are multiple success messages displayed. Only ids are displayed in house list and no other info",1173715,1,8100
"The user interface looks pretty, is clean and intuitive. But the placement of menu buttons was rather ""not-obvious"". It took time for me to figure out login / signup buttons, and I also had to actively look for buttons to perform actions after signing-in, which isn't actually much user friendly. Though it may seemed cliche, but I think it is very user-friendly to have action buttons on the content of the web-page, rather than having them at the top inside the header. But apart from that, the simplicity and the look and feel was pretty good.",1167088,1,8100
"It is surely a very intuitive user interface because the ease of navigation is generally very well defined and the routes.rb file in git hub makes the session linkage explicit.  Even, so one does fail to understand the empty blanks on their login page since there aren't any blanks at all. So, we get easily confused on what to do. Sign up is not validated for any functionality be it user or admin or realtor and we don't know what to do.  Luckily, the README File does resolve the dilemma and help us to follow the steps. ",1161104,1,8100
The app is deployed very well and is very easy to use.,1174767,-1,8100
"All the basic features implemented for admin,house hunter and realtor is functional.  ",1165233,-1,8100
"No, testing portion of the code seems empty. No testing has been done",1173768,1,8100
"The login / signup module has lots of bugs. Like when a user tries to create an account with an already existing username, the application crashes. Also, a user cannot signup as both, a realtor and a househunter. Moreover, there isnt any validtion for the length of phone number, nor the validation for the email address is correct. (for example, it accepts aa@a as a valid email address). So yes, these functionalities in the login signup module could be improved, and these does not seem thoroughly tested. But the search functionality for the houses seemed to work pretty well, and as expected.",1167141,1,8100
"Well, we can say that they have indeed tested the models they have defined in their README file on GitHub. The definitions of the functionalities in the 'db' folders and the controllers folder makes it very easy to follow how they have structured the code. Also, the way the houses are added, the redirection the houses to the links such as CMU and NCSU websites is very intuitive and well thought out, and thus barring out a few minor mistakes in linking and page definitions the code has a good ability to run for the defined cases specially for the Admin to be failsafe. Only, one complaint though, the whole structure does crumble when one sees that they have allowed the admin to be DELETED. This is their biggest loophole. ",1161157,1,8100

"Yes, the commits were regular. After the project was assigned, there were several commits on a weekly basis, and as the deadline neared, the frequency of the commits kept increasing in an orderly manner. There was no last minute rush, and the development of the project seemed pretty well planned.",1167142,-1,8100
"Yes, as seen from the number of commits on each section of their GitHub profile, not only have they meticulously made a number of changes on Repo, but they have also updated what all changes they made against the files. This is a very neat practice in my opinion and shows that they have put ample effort to structure the code. Moreover, they have updates the GemFile multiple times so as to make it run for the Heroku app which is a must thing to do and a challenge we faced too. ",1161158,-1,8100
"Yes, there are git commits and pushes after initial commit as well.",1174821,-1,8100
"The code itself appears to be very clean. The lack of scaffolding (or the stripped down scaffolding that it presents) means there's a lot less dead code in the files. All the indentation and variable names appear to follow convention as well. This cleanliness, on further inspection, appear to stem from the fact that the application frequently does not support needed functionality. The code that's there is clean though.",1156449,1,8045
"No, not really. No user type has all the functionality in this review's check boxes, much less all the functionality specified in the project description. Manual inspection of the test folder reveals that all the model and controller tests are empty, as are the fixtures.",1156504,-1,8045
"I cannot appraise this because I do not believe they did their development in the linked repo. There is only one commit, where all the functionality was added. I am inclined to say the team was not actively developing over the project period.",1156505,-1,8045
The model and controller are well designed. Each method covers a single functionality! Good job,1157436,-1,8045
"The project needs validations on all fields (I was able to enter random values in email address, mobile number fields). Some of the additional functionalities were missing (filter inquiry, see who has added my house to their inquiry list etc). The project is well connected and navigation is easy. Overall it looks very clean and intuitive! ",1157491,1,8045
"All users have their own model controllers. The code is following Ruby on Rails standards but there are some debug ""puts"" that should be removed.",1161159,-1,8045
Yes it is deployed on Heroku.,1161161,-1,8045
Admin and Realtor's functionalities are partially working. Many other features need to implement. ,1161214,1,8045
I could see only one person's commits. Each team member needs to contribute to Git.,1161215,1,8045
"The login / signup module seems to be well tested of all the other models and controllers in the program. But this module has a drawback. It deals with three tables, the realtors, the househunters and the admin. Due to this kind of segmentation, there is a repetition of data i the database, if any user would like to signup as both. Also, it would make it difficult to handle complexity as the application grows. According to me, its better to atleast cascade the tables of realtors and house hunters into one.  The other functionalities are not wholly implemented, only the CRUD operations related to those are implemented, hence not much could be reviewed about testing.",1173540,1,8045
"The models, views and controllers have been properly designed and implemented.",1174936,1,8081
Most of the practices have been followed,1159690,-1,8081

"The UI is mostly easy to use, but the README is nearly undocumented.",1167667,1,8081
The deployed link is not accessible. The readme file describes the process for just admin login but not for the consequent steps. ,1162218,1,8081
The UI is straight forward and easy to use. The implementation of the menu bar makes it look better. Though there is a scope for improvement. The admin link in the Readme file is not working.,1164838,1,8081
"nice user interface, good use layouts. but unable to log in as admin,",1172224,1,8081
UI is nicely done.  There are a few things that can be improved:  1. Clear all / list all houses field once a search parameter has been given 2. Do not show receiver object id in inquiries. Maybe something more useful.,1165943,1,8081
Controller has been tested  ,1159745,-1,8081

"While there are some tests for controllers, they were only the auto-created tests by Rails. There were test files for the models, but not test cases present.",1161429,1,8090
"Controllers have a few test cases, models have none. Some of the suggested test cases could be as follows-: company_test.rb -> company should not be deleted if not owner of company (realtor should only be able to delete company if he created it)",1170678,1,8090
 Only scaffold generated tests for models and controllers.,1175789,1,8090
Yes,1156776,-1,8090
no test cases found in the test folder,1171992,1,8090
I have seen they keep updating the github,1167313,-1,8090
There were changes pushed to the branch throughout the project period.,1170679,-1,8090
" No, the initial commits were made the Thursday before the 1st submission was do. It is great to see additional commits since the 1st submission!",1175790,-1,8090
The first commit for the project was made only 4 days before the deadline. since then the team kept continuously pushing their changes.,1156777,-1,8090
I can see 28 commits with a good distribution over the time span.,1171993,-1,8090
The code has good style and recognizable convention over configuration. There are some line spacing issues however.,1177508,1,8043
"Yes we can see many pushes on git. Hence , they have updated code.",1177710,-1,8043
Timely commits and elaborated readme file.,1167143,-1,8043
"The models , views and controllers are well created.   1)      You can seed data for the admin into your production environment. The command to do this on heroku is heroku run rails db:seed. You need to make changes in the db/seeds.rb file and add your admin credentials in the proper format in this file.",1162273,1,8043
"Everything seems good. You can move constants to a separate file and use them . For example where you are comparing ==""admin"" or ==""realtor"". You can either move them to a separate file or in database and use it.",1173143,1,8043
"The code is clear and concise, it does follow good Ruby and Rails coding practices.",1162080,-1,8043
"Yes, the code does follow Ruby and Rails practices to an extent, as I can see the use of many helper methods in the code.",1159109,-1,8043
Stress is given to MVC architecture. But proper comments in the code section can simplify the code understanding for other users.,1168893,1,8043
"The user interface has a bare bones look and feel but is intuitive overall. The inquiries list is hard to find for the admin, and the links below the tables could be placed at the top of the screen to improve the UX. The inquiry component of the app had awkward navigation, particularly for the realtor. This is also awkward for the house hunter. Only one link is needed up top.",1177510,1,8043
Yes. I am able to login into the system via the link provided.,1177712,-1,8043
Sign-up for realtors and admin gives application error. ,1167145,1,8043
The user interface is pretty intuitive. Few things like the create house functionality is breaking on heroku and giving an application error.,1162275,1,8043
They have attached 2 other files saying what all they have implemented.,1173145,-1,8043
Everything was described properly in the README file.,1162082,-1,8043
"The user interface is average.  The good parts I found about UI are: 1. Error messages (while registering a new admin/house hunter/realtor/house/company) were helpful. 2. Front-end checks like mail and phone number size and type etc have been used properly. 3. Dropdown for companies while registering houses, for houses while submitting inquiruies etc are properly implemented and easy to use. However, several very small changes would make the UI much better: 1. Allow a drop-down when signing up as roles 2. Add inquire a house or add a new house to interest list etc functionalituies at the top. If house list gets a few hundred rows long, user must scroll all the way down to access the functionalities. 3. Add message as to why login failed. Something as simple as ""Invalid credentials"" would suffice and let user know that the login is working but the password is incorrect.",1164360,1,8043
"UI is simple to follow. Enhancements mentioned below can simplify various tasks 1. Preferred contact method can be drop down with ""text, mail, phone"" options. 2. User role can be drop down with ""buyer and realtor"".",1168895,1,8043
"No model tests were found, but a controller test was well tested.",1177563,1,8043
I could see testing done. I could see extra test cases added.,1177765,1,8043
"I feel the user model is well tested. The link to houses broke through realtor role on heroku. This might just be a production issue and might work well locally in the development environment. I recommend checking the heroku logs and fixing this error. Due to this error, I could not create any house for listing. Overall, I feel it is a good job and you have managed to implement most of the functionalities.  One suggestion would be :  1)      When I try to sign-up as a user, I have to fill up the role type. This is not intuitive for a user as the user does not know what kinds of roles and their format(case sensitivity, data type etc) expected by your system. I would suggest either give a drop down for this or checkboxes which will be easy for a user to use.",1162328,1,8043
You haven't completed this task.,1173198,1,8043
Yes ,1162135,-1,8043
"Parts of the code is tested partially, none of the models are tested thoroughly",1168948,1,8043
All the tests are auto-generated.,1164413,-1,8043
The team all had multiple commits throughout the course of the project.,1177564,-1,8043
Yes i could see multiple pushes.  ,1177766,-1,8043
"The team has been pushing changes since around 12 days ago, and the project structure feels well planned with some changes and testing required.",1162329,-1,8043
"They have 195 commits. Ui is great, everything is running smoothly.",1173199,-1,8043
The project was continuously updated during the past two weeks.,1162136,-1,8043
Git shows too many changes which are not required. One can test thoroughly before submitting the changes.,1168949,-1,8043
Code commit frequency is fairly good.,1164414,-1,8043
Git link is not working. the account might be private,1160475,1,8109
The code follows common ruby rails guidelines,1174137,-1,8109
Comments and indentation at a couple of places can be update.,1158596,1,8109
"house_hunter_accounts_controller.rb line 28: meaningless line break. house_list_controller.rb line 8,98: meaningless line break. realtor_accounts_controller.rb line 28: meaningless line break. session_controller.rb line 6,19,20: Wrong indentations, line 9: No parentheses. user_controller.rb line 13:meaningless line break, line 52: No parentheses.  ",1173428,1,8109
Have used DRY principles. Follows good coding practices.,1163611,-1,8109
UI is fine but cannot access readme file,1160477,1,8109
"Yes the UI is good and easy for navigation, usage.",1174139,-1,8109
Readme needs to be updated. UI looks good but UX can be worked upon.   ,1158598,1,8109
The UI is good and intuitive. Good use of colors and html features.,1163613,-1,8109
"Application is deployed on Heroku, but the user interface does not compliant with the requirement(your home page contains house information and search function before user signing in). Also it is not described in the README file.",1173430,1,8109
"Yes, there are many commits which added new features and fixed some bugs. ",1173484,-1,8109
Yes there are lot of commits over many days from multiple contributors,1174193,-1,8109
"The link provided is not working. So, no way of finding out",1160531,1,8109
"Yeah, they have done the project with even number of commits throughout the duration.",1163667,-1,8109
"Yes, tests are done for many models and controllers.",1174192,-1,8109
"Test skeleton present. However, tests can be made in depth.",1158651,1,8109
"I noticed they did generate tests for some controllers, but not enough. No tests for models. ",1173483,1,8109
"It has not been thoroughly tested. user,house and company models don't have enough validations, like valid year, phone no should be only numbers.Creating a company while creating a user doesn't link that company to the user. it has to be done manually later ",1160530,1,8109
Basic tests are written. Could improve by adding specific application logic.,1163666,1,8109
"While the application has a similar layout as a typical Rails application, I noticed there were no migrations in the DB. Also, the README was not formatted very well and didn't tell me much about how to install the project locally.",1161374,1,8122
The code seems to be following the examples in cookbook app.,1167257,-1,8122
"The code follows on the lines of good ruby on rails practices. However, I can see no migrations in the db folder. The readme file contains sql statements for table completion which look to be correct.",1170623,1,8122
" The source code and project structure seems fine, but most of it still looks scaffold generated. RoR conventions have been maintained.",1175734,-1,8122
Yes. Timely commits with comments.,1166498,-1,8122
The code written was clear and I believe that it follows good Ruby and Rails coding practices to a certain extent.,1156721,-1,8122
It is done well and I can say it is a indeed a good ruby and rails coding practice,1171937,-1,8122
"I was not provided a link, so I cannot see if the UI is intuitive.",1161376,1,8122
The website is not up yet. I looked through the code. Looks like there are still some functionalities not implemented.,1167259,1,8122
"Unfortunately the app has not been deployed on a cloud platform and neither is there any description in the readme file. I suggest to use heroku as your deployment platform. You may want to look into this video here = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kVtmnZNC8w&feature=youtu.be   Also if you deploy in heroku, it does not support sqlite or mysql in production. Hence you will need to migrate your DB to postgres. Check out this link for help = https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/sqlite3",1170625,1,8122
"If it is deployed, it is not made known. ",1175736,1,8122
Please provide the link to the deployed website.,1166500,1,8122
The link to the deployed application was not posted and README file does not have the required information such as admin login details or how to access various features in the application.,1156723,1,8122
I do not see the link in the readme file for the deployment in the cloud,1171939,1,8122
"I dd not find the link. I viewed the code on Github, it seems work. ",1157995,-1,8122
"While there are some tests for controllers, they were only the auto-created tests by Rails. There were test files for the models, but not test cases present.",1161429,1,8122
"Controllers have a few test cases, models have none. Some of the suggested test cases could be as follows-: company_test.rb -> company should not be deleted if not owner of company (realtor should only be able to delete company if he created it)",1170678,1,8122
 Only scaffold generated tests for models and controllers.,1175789,1,8122
Yes,1156776,-1,8122
no test cases found in the test folder,1171992,1,8122
I have seen they keep updating the github,1167313,-1,8122
There were changes pushed to the branch throughout the project period.,1170679,-1,8122
" No, the initial commits were made the Thursday before the 1st submission was do. It is great to see additional commits since the 1st submission!",1175790,-1,8122
The first commit for the project was made only 4 days before the deadline. since then the team kept continuously pushing their changes.,1156777,-1,8122
I can see 28 commits with a good distribution over the time span.,1171993,-1,8122
"The app's indentation, method names, and line separation seem to match solid Ruby style guidelines.",1169007,-1,8021
Decent coding practice,1159940,-1,8021
From what I see it seems to be following the practice we have been using in class,1156210,-1,8021
" Yes, the source code follows expected RoR style. The directory names and project structure also follow RoR conventions. Good job!",1174311,-1,8021
The code base is very well written and commented. The code has been done with good coding practices. The only point to note would be to update the Readme to be more informative.,1172450,-1,8021
Good Rails coding practice has been implemented. In Model as well Controller we can see variables names that shows the relation to overall module and model. ,1164893,-1,8021
"The user interface is nice. I suggest you move the search button in the houses screen to the left. Also, ""yes"" and ""no"" would probably be more user-friendly than ""true"" and ""false"" for the basement condition. The new user window was very intuitive and powerful. Note: I found a bug in this window: changing the admin account with ""REALTOR"" checked causes an error. The error screen was graceful, however. Also, please use radio buttons for ""HUNTER"" or ""REALTOR"", not checkboxes. Please also include the type of the user in the users window.",1169009,-1,8021
The UI is quite good but the design can be improved. The application allows a realtor to add company details while signing up which does not make for great design. Without authentication no user should be allowed to perform any functionality.,1174541,1,8021
No CSS has been applied. Links are redirecting to pages instead of just performing the action,1159942,1,8021
" the links tell you what page you will go to or what action you will do. It's not pretty, but it works enough",1156212,1,8021
" UI is easy to use, but not well described in the README. Please add brief Test Cases to demonstrate expected functionality.",1174313,-1,8021
The interface is basic and no extra styling is done. But overall the web application is easy and intuitive to use. The Read me  file of the github repo should be updated to make it more   detailed to use.  ,1172452,-1,8021
"The interface is intuitive. Specially, they have very good form structure for realtor as well as new users, and house hunters. ",1164895,-1,8021
It appears minimal controller testing has been performed.,1169062,1,8021
No tests have been written for the application,1174594,1,8021
Testing has not been done for any modle or controller yet,1159995,1,8021
No they have not. They said they will for the final submission,1156265,-1,8021
"No testing, but at least they mentioned it in the readme.",1174366,1,8021
No testing module found!,1164948,1,8021
The team used mutliple branches and many commits throughout the project to increment on the codebase.,1169063,-1,8021
"While the team did push changes to the project, there are 95 commits which are unnecessary. Instead of pushing every change to the final project, the team could have combined a few of the changes and pushed them all at once to make for better record of the changes made.",1174595,-1,8021
Teams looks fairly active but the project progress does not correspond to the number of commits made in the git repository,1159996,-1,8021
 They have a lot of commits so they were always working on it,1156266,-1,8021
"Yes, it looks like sizable commits were made before the 24th.",1174367,-1,8021
Yes 95 commits. ,1164949,-1,8021
The code is very well written and organised. All the framework conventions have been followed such as the naming conventions. Comments have been added at appropriate places which improved the readability.,1171709,-1,8075
yes. code is written properly. followed dry principle. added comments where possible. followed mvc with rails framework.,1173770,-1,8075
"First of all, this website doesn't work at all. I can't sign up as any role. And I also can't get admin's info from README file, which is an auto-generated file.",1168007,1,8075
"It does well to follow the ""good Ruby and Rails coding practices"". It follows the DRY code approach.",1177451,-1,8075
"Looking at your code on github , you guys are following good coding practices. Just at some places you have repeated you code, for example in /myaccounts/show.html.erb you are repeating alot of code. You can create one html file for the repeated code and call it based on the object or move the repeated code to a section and use it.",1161431,1,8075
The Git code included almost everything that follows good coding practices using Ruby and Rails. ,1156335,-1,8075
"Readme file is not updated. Couldn't find admin credentials. The UI looked promising on the login page but the signup fails, i am not able to sign up either as a house hunter or as a realtor. Tried so many times in all possible ways. Without these I couldn't test any of the functionalities. The error message was ""Sign Up failed, Please retry""",1171711,1,8075
yes. User Interface is good and easy to access.,1173772,-1,8075
"No, the README file is an auto-generated file, and there is no details in it.",1168009,1,8075
A little confusing as there are two sign up forms one under the other and it is not clear what they are for.,1168123,1,8075
Only the registration page is working and the interface is quite confusing as it has sign-up for both realtor and hunter on the same page which is bit confusing.,1159350,1,8075
"Admin credentials not provided, realtor and house hunter signup throws error so unable to use app.",1175622,1,8075
"You haven't specified anything in your Readme file. Plus you have given a link to heroku app but its not working. Please make sure its working. I saw you guys had been committing code to your master branch, have you guys pushed it to heroku. That might be the reason it got broken. ",1161433,1,8075
The UI seems to be flexible. It could include trace back to the home page. The README file could include the details to login as email. This would be helpful to use the site to it's full potential.,1156337,1,8075
No model test cases. Controllers not tested exhaustively.,1171764,1,8075
"Team has tested hounse hunter functionalities but not admin and realtor functionalities. Register page asks us to put credentials twice. We are able to register for house hunter only irrespective of choosing any field (house hunter or realtor). Hence I am not able to login into realtor account. Also could not find any credentials for admin, realtor or house hunter in readme file.  Hence not able to login into admin account also.   New link provided in document is not working. If would be great it team could check the link and come back.",1173825,1,8075
I don't think the test part of this website is working.,1168062,1,8075
You guys haven't implemented unit test for your project yet. ,1161486,1,8075
The house hunter model seemed to work according to most of the tasks mentioned. Not for the admin and realtor ones. Was unable to login as admin. Was unable t signup as realtor. ,1156390,1,8075
Excellent commit history. Contributions from all team members could be seen.,1171765,-1,8075
Yes I could see many push requests on the github. Hence concluding team is pushing their changes periodically.,1173826,0,8075
"I find few changing records from github, but I can't show the process of development.",1168063,1,8075
"Yes, the team kept pushing changes throughout the project period",1168177,-1,8075
There was consistent commits with a spike in between when probably most development happened,1175676,1,8075
"looking at your commit history, you guys started it on Saturday when the submission was Monday.",1161487,1,8075
"The website did not seem to work at first. Now I was able to access it. I also noticed some features that were included in the meantime like testing by adding house hunters. Overall, the team did work on updating the site functionalities. ",1156391,-1,8075
"There are some indentation issues, but otherwise the code has method names in line with convention over configuration and the spacing and line spacing are reasonable. Also, IDs should not be on the UI. The house hunters and realtors should not have to sign in after signing up.",1177122,1,8023
There are a lot of not-so-important comments in the controllers. And a lot of DRY code,1160589,1,8023
"This team has done a good job of following Rails conventions. There are DB migrations, common layouts of the application structure and proper use of ActiveRecord helpers.",1161602,1,8023
The code seems very good. And the code is very clearly.,1165691,-1,8023
The Git code did follow the good coding practices using Ruby and Rails. ,1156392,-1,8023
"All files they provided are clearly structured, especially for the routes file. They provide clear routes for different conditions.",1164301,-1,8023
"The user interface has a very basic look and feel. The sign up links being on every page is not ideal. There should only be a log out link. Also, the company in the realtor page is showing the id, not the company's name. I suggest you use a drop down menu for the preferred contact of the house hunter who is signing up. It would be much more intuitive to have a single sign-in page for all users. There were also missing back buttons.",1177124,1,8023
Yes. The UI is easy to use. But the dashboard could be made better . As every task is written on the same line,1160591,1,8023
"While links and navigation were generally easy to find, several links rendered broken pages and several got stuck in a loop asking me to log in as an Admin to edit a user when I was already logged in. ",1161604,1,8023
"For all user, sign up and log in should at the same place.",1165693,-1,8023
"The UI had good directives between operations, functionalities and was easy to use. The admin profile was available in the README file.",1156394,-1,8023
"The readme file is blank, so I cannot get access to the admin functions. The user interface is clear but not so well-structured. For example, the title appears after the different choices. And all the choices are list in a single line.",1164303,1,8023
"There are some indentation issues, but otherwise the code has method names in line with convention over configuration and the spacing and line spacing are reasonable. Also, IDs should not be on the UI. The house hunters and realtors should not have to sign in after signing up.",1177122,1,8047

"While a thorough controller test exists, there is no model test.",1177177,1,8047
"After deleting a user from the admin account, I am being signed out of the application",1160644,1,8047
"While there are test files, I don't see any completed tests (especially for Models) outside of what is provided by default in Rails.",1161657,1,8047
I am unable to view real estate companies from the admin account,1160645,1,8047
"Yes, there were some improvements that I noticed while testing the site features in the review duration which included modifications to view list of all houses created by company of which realtor is a part. The program has scope for minimal improvements to make it function as needed.",1156448,1,8047
"Of the functionality the team have tried to to implement, the code quality is not poor. However, the arrangement of code is difficult to understand given that not all functionalities seem to have been implemented. The ""def after_sign_in_path_for"" function in the applications controller used by the devise gem, only takes realtor as a resource, I would advise using an if or case condition within the function to allow other users to login. Also, I was unable to find any implementation for making sure that only the inquiries specific to a real estate company be visible to a realtor, and similarly only the inquiries posted by a house hunter themselves be visible to the house hunter on that specific house. I would again suggest using some If or case statements in the show function of the inquiries controller to establish identity of current_user. ",1185912,1,8049
Lot of unnecessary directories are created in 'controller',1190666,1,8049
"Yes, it is.",1196614,-1,8049
Code seems to follow the Ruby Practices.,1187865,-1,8049
Code is written in a clean and readable way. There are separete methods for separate tasks.  Good naming convention is followed throughout the project.,1180424,-1,8049
recompany could have been just company,1189759,-1,8049
"The code is clean and readable. Every method handles only one task. However there are two controllers for house hunters and realtors which I felt was redundant. These could have been merged and written in a single controller. There is no bad naming in the project, they have followed the naming conventions. There are no long methods. Methods have been written concisely and in a readable way.",1195185,1,8049
The team seems to have attempted to add to their functionality from the previous round. They have attempted to use the devise gem for allowing multiple user logins. It seems that they created a new git repo and started from the beginning which seems like a fair idea given that they wanted to use devise instead of implementing the user registration/sessions. ,1185913,-1,8049
"Yes, they have keep commit to git as their project been working. ",1196615,-1,8049
"Fewer commits on the project, More towards the deadline date.",1187866,1,8049

From the Code DB Design looks fine. They have handled most of the relationships properly. Although I believe having different tables for admins/realtors/hunters/users/roles and role maps is un-necessary and just increases the complexity of the system. ,1187867,1,8049

"I cannot access the link provided by the team. Since this is hosted on AWS, I believe they have not opened the Ip to public by mistake (I have worked with AWS before and this happens). Maybe they worked from Library or their house, and when you spawn an instance in AWS it adds the IP from where the instance is spawned to the access list, which is why I am not able to access this from my IP. This can also be a problem with the proxy server setup in the instance and since you guys are maybe doing ssh into the server to deploy your code, the default HTTP request will go to port 80 and wont be forwarded to 8080 unless explicitly specified in apache/nginx and will block the requests.

the users controller has a lot of nested if block in the forgotPassword method and resetPassword method,1189582,1,8082

The naming represented the task( such as: remove_from_interest_list, show_potential_buyers etc ) of the method and no extra load was carried by that method, except for the action assigned to the method.  No methods were longer than necessary and no unnecessary nesting was present. Though not major, a suggestion for the team is to avoid using pronouns or subjective references such as my_interest_list and houses_posted_by_me for method naming.

Most of these relations are bi-directional associations, so there should ideally have been a belongs_to relation.

"   All basic functionality outlined by the test suite is working as expected with few corner case bugs. The filter functionality should have been more flexible to filter for a range of price and Sq ft, rather than try to match exact numbers provided which is not user friendly.

"Yes, major changes and feature implementations are there after 1st round. All basic functionalities are working properly.",1195142,-1,8082
(1): Admin can delete real-estate companies with realtors attached to it (2): Realtor is being able to delete any house (3): Admin can delete house-hunter with several enquires.,1189475,-1,8082
All test cases are covered. The README doesn't cover how edge cases are covered but that's not an issue.,1195151,-1,8082
"1. if a real estate company is deleted has houses and realtor, then the house and inquiries are deleted too 2. when you change your company as a realtor, then you can't edit houses listed from another company, but it still shows up 3. the inquiries are deleted if the respective hunter is deleted  ",1189586,1,8082
"When I delete a real estate company, all the realtors in that company get deleted too. Realtors can still edit houses they made for one company after they switch companies.",1180495,1,8082
1. DELETES 2. NOPE 3. DELETES 4. NO EDGE CASES MENTIONED,1195927,1,8082
"1. When the company of a realtor was changed, realtor details got updated with this new company details. But he could still edit/update the houses that he/she had listed for the prev company. They could send replies to inquiries also. 2. A realtor could edit the details of all the houses. 3. What will happen if the admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries? - cascade delete in working. 4. Other major edge cases are also working.",1185828,-1,8082
"1) When the admin deletes a real estate company all the realtors associated with them are deleted along with all the houses posted by those realtors. 2) Currently the Realtor is able to edit/delete houses of other companies which is the fault in the behavior and the team needs to correct this to test this edge case. 3) If Admin deletes a house_hunter all their queries are automatically deleted.Also they are deleted from potential buyers list. 4) i)If a Relator replies to the query, the house hunter is unable to see them in the system. ii) Validation on phone numbers should be enforced. iii) Session handling could be improved, few left over data are present on screen after logging out and using direct links to access page. such as hunter query after logging out.    No documentation on READ.me regarding edge cases.    ",1185528,1,8082
"1.If admin deletes a company which has realtors and houses, the realtor associated with it get deleted. 2. Realtor can change her company and she can delete the ad posts previously posted by her. 3.Admin can delete the house hunter who has several queries and inquiries get deleted automatically.    ",1195143,1,8082
"Except the login controller, none of the models/controller seems to be well tested.There are no test-cases written for any of the controllers, or in general any component of the application.",1189476,1,8082
Testing has not been done. Models and controllers are well designed hence the 2 points. You could have used basic RSpec tests to validate the flow of control.,1195152,1,8082
i looked through all the files in the test folder and don't see any tests filled in. They seem to only be the pre filled skeleton.,1189587,1,8082
The controller and model tests were not updated.,1180496,1,8082

code naming convention done well.,1195616,-1,8087
"The code has been implemented as per the Ruby standards of coding. However, there are few instances of code could be better handled such as the index function in admin controller.  ",1194260,1,8087
"Overall, it's good. Also in houses_controller.rb, the logic in the find_houses method should have been moved to the corresponding model. Application logic should be moved to the model. The admins_controller found in app/controllers is empty. What's it for? Also, when it comes to naming, house_controller and home_controller seems confusing.",1191602,1,8087
1) Yes 2) No 3) No,1184554,-1,8087
"The application code is properly divided into modules. the controller have defined functions for various tasks. The functionalities of interest list , potential buyers , replies to inquires are missing from the application. Class Reg1 is not a proper name for the class . Also the class is included in the houses controller which is not a good programming practice. The developers should have created a new controller for the Reg1 class. The validations are missing for Company details. Also separate sessions are created for different user types.",1183987,1,8087
commits performed during the course.,1195617,-1,8087
All the code of the project has been pushed to Github on a single day.,1194261,1,8087
Only 8 commits were found. The first commit was dated around Oct 6. No changes were committed in round 2.,1191603,1,8087
"No, according to the commits record in github, I think that they seems created a new repository to replace the old one, and most of changes happened in one day, Oct 10. Besides, I cannot see the sign of team work. In Oct 6,  one guy submited the first comit, and the other guy submitted some changes in Oct 10, which doesn't look like a team work. Since they replaced the old repository with a new repo and didn't show much sign of team working, I give they one point.",1194100,1,8087
"Didn't commit at regular intervals. Yes, committed changes in round 2.",1184555,1,8087
The git Repository was created on Oct 6 after the round 1 was completed. The commits were no regular during the complete course of the project. All the commits happened on the day of final submission.,1183988,1,8087
handled 1 to n and n to n relationships succesfully.,1195618,-1,8087
The team has handled all the associations between multiple entities quite well.,1194262,-1,8087
The relationships are properly defined.,1191604,-1,8087
Follows the relationships properly.,1184556,-1,8087
"The use of active record is missing from the application. There are no foreign key relationships in the schema. Although the relationship are maintained in the model file. A separate database is created for admin/realtor/hunter which will store a lot of redundant data. There is no database for storing the response of inquiries. According to the db design , a house belongs to both a company and a realtor directly which is not correct.  ",1183989,1,8087
the basic functionalities work successfully.,1195619,-1,8087
The code is well written following the right RoR coding practices,1193839,-1,8055
  ,1193942,-1,8055
Follows good coding practice at most places.,1184066,-1,8055
"Code is written in an efficient, clean and readable manner. All the functions are lucid and defined properly in blocks. A proper use of names for controllers, migrations and views can be seen.",1184711,-1,8055
yes the coding style was good,1194727,-1,8055
"Ruby guidelines are followed to good extent. Clean and legible code. A few things can be written in a more ""ruby like"" manner, like the index method of house controller. E.g. min_price = something if ... would be a better and more concise alternative. Models can have more validations. Other than that, code is well written. ",1184074,1,8055

"A lot of commits were done in phase 2. A total of 106 commits were performed which is quite impressive. It shows that the team was working in a timely manner, so well done there.  However, I deducted 1 star as I could see 2 commits done after the deadline on Oct 13.",1184712,1,8055
The 1-n and n-n relationships are properly handled. ,1193841,-1,8055

  ,1193944,-1,8055
"All the relationships are correct. Also the houses table shows the time at which the house was created, which is impressive. Additionally, the real estate company also shows the number of realtors for each company, good work on that!",1184713,-1,8055
"Yes, even constraints were defined well",1194729,-1,8055
Relationships are implemented correctly. ,1184076,-1,8055
There were issues with the admin functionalities in the first round. They have been fixed.,1193842,-1,8055
1 ) Admin cannot reply to Inquiries Posted by the users. If he can I am not able to find that option from the dashboard. 2 ) Admin cannot delete the real estate companies in some random cases. works in some. 3 ) I could not find the option to switch between hunter and realtor roles. 4 ) Search is Case sensitive 5 ),1184069,1,8055
  ,1193945,-1,8055
" All the major functionalities work and most of them work. However, There are a couple of bugs that could be solved:  After submitting a inquiry and clicking ""back"", the user is redirected to the page where all the messages in the database are shown The realtor is not able to view the potential buyers for any house  The look and all the major functionalities are running smoothly. Great work on that!  ",1184714,1,8055
most issues were fixed,1194730,-1,8055
"Admin can not delete or edit companies, The search functionality for houses is not working (Filter by min price) Admin can add house to only one company. Admin can not view list of users Admin can not delete inquiries from the system. Realtor can not view inquiries sent to houses in the company not posted by him",1184077,1,8055
  ,1193946,-1,8055
The quality of the code is reasonably good. Would it be possible for the team to avoid using the little interpretable ruby they use in the html files and instead use the controllers and its helpers for writing all logic?,1190979,1,8092
"While Trying to delete a real estate company with existing realtors, the system is failing.",1193843,1,8055
Handles most of the edge cases properly. There are some bugs related to Messages as i could not test it properly. In some cases deleting a user or a company fails.,1184070,1,8055
"Overall the code is written in an extremely clean and readable way. Having said that I would like to propose one suggestion which may help in future. There's 2 instances where code has been added in the index function of controllers (namely houses_controller.rb & list_of_pot_buyers_controller.rb). After the if else condition if search exists or not, the main search logic in houses_controller.rb could be added to a new function by passing the search params to that function. Similarly in list_of_pot_buyers_controller.rb, the SQL queries should be put in other functions say ""def generate_list_of_potential_buyers""",1190674,1,8092
"Unfortunately, all the edge cases in the given question are failing  The system encounters an error while deleting a real estate company After changing the real estate company, the realtor can still delete the house that he had created with a previous company Even after deleting the user from the dashboard, the queries submitted by the users are not deleted There was no potential buyers list available for viewing even after adding houses to the interest list myself  These cases could be seen upon and improved",1184715,1,8055
"I think the code is well written. The function calls are very well done. It is neat and easily readable. Also, there is no bad naming the project. Code very well follows the DRY approach.",1193899,-1,8092
The code is clean and easily understood. A separate controller for adding the buyers to the potential buyer list is created. Overall the structure and naming of controllers and migration file is clear and the respective functionalities can be identified based on the names. The team has done good work on that,1187000,-1,8092
"The code itself is fairly clean and readable. The class ListOfPotentialBuyers is poorly named, and I'm not sure you need a separate class for it.",1188980,1,8092
Function calls are added. Code is formatted and neat. Naming conventions are followed.,1195193,-1,8092
"1. the realtors also got deleted its a pass 2.switches successfully 3.previous company house cannot be removed inquires, will not get deleted with the removed house hunter",1194731,1,8055
Several linear commits visible on the git. Most of the work done in round 2 is fixes and additional functionalities on top of the base that was finished before round 1.,1190980,-1,8092
The team promptly handled the task by working on it regularly and committing changes frequently.,1190675,-1,8092
"I was unable to judge if this works -there was no way for me to determine that. The admin can not delete companies, can not view, edit or delete realtors or househunters. Also, users cannot delete themselves.  Further, the third party admin gem or module  used does not let me edit or delete users or companies either - it gives an error on heroku.  Thus, I was unable to determine if the edge cases work. Also README does not specify anything.",1184078,-1,8055
"By looking at their github page, I could see they submitted their changes actively and also they continued submitting changes in round 2 as well.",1193900,-1,8092
"most the things are done in phase 2 only. but few things are missing. house hunter can't edit/delete his inquiry. no page for house hunter to see what all he has marked as interested. Not able to figure out as a house hunter if i have marked a house interested or not. realtor not . able to reply to inquiry, its throwing error.",1187906,1,8092
The team submitted the changes at equal intervals of time and the last commit was performed a day prior to the deadline which is commendable.,1187001,-1,8092
This team continued to commit throughout the project.,1188981,-1,8092
The test for real_estate_companies_controller and real_estate_company model are present.,1193844,-1,8055
Team has been consistent in pushing code changes,1195194,-1,8092
They have tested real_estate_company controller and model. ,1184071,-1,8055
  ,1193947,-1,8055
"Yes, there are 60 commits. Well done.",1182242,-1,8092
Yes they have implemented unit tests as well as functional tests.,1188745,-1,8055
"It seems evident that there are deletion issues for any resource/user that is already indexed on some other resource/user. The solution to that issue would be  adding a destroy dependency in model files, for example for house hunters, has_many :inquiries, dependent::destroy",1190983,1,8092
 The team has done an impressive job in handling the tests for messages and real estate companies.,1184716,-1,8055
"1. houses stillshow up after deleting company 2. when a realtor switches companies, their old listed house still shows up and is editable 3. no potential buyer list",1189744,1,8092
yes i can see a variety of edge cases being tested,1194732,-1,8055
"Tests have been implemented for a model and a controller. However, I believe that they are not exhaustive. Only one test case which will succeed has been implemented. You should try to implement more test cases, like what happens when one of the things which is mandatory is absent. Further, I am afraid that the tests are not testing the correct thing. For eg, should create real_estate_company tests  assert_redirected_to ""/real_estate_companies/#{r.id}"" while it should be testing if the company can be saved.",1184079,1,8055
"User Role-: Once a user is created, and goes to edit their profile, if they uncheck both roles there is no way for that user to get any role back. Their should be a check in the user table that both roles cannot be blank. Also, unfortunately there is no mention of how the system handles edge cases in the Readme file",1190678,1,8092
"1) If the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses, it would not delete the record, because a dependent realtor exists.   2) The realtor can change his real estate company and he won't be prohibited from removing houses.   3) If admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries, the inquiries will be deleted and house hunter will be removed from the buyers' list.",1193903,1,8092
if a company is deleted the realtor and houses doesn't get deleted. and if a house gets deleted the inquires are not getting deleted.,1187909,1,8092
"Unfortunately most of the edge cases fail.  The houses of the realtors are listed even after deleting the real estate company. Also the realtors list display the realtors associated with the deleted real estate company. The realtor is able to access the houses owned by old real estate companies after changing their own real estate company After deleting a user, the inquiries continue to be listed ",1187004,1,8092
"This system is not properly linked together. Real Estate companies are not required to list houses, realtors can see and respond to all inquiries from everyone, creation of inquiries is not linked to a specific house.",1188984,1,8092
"One thing is that once the company that a realtor belongs to was destroyed, he or she can also list houses, and that should be reconsidered.",1182245,1,8092
The code looks comprehensive to a good extent with the usage of comments and clear naming. 1. Adding the remove from wish list feature is a plus point. 2. The naming is done well with attention to the singular and plural nouns for models and controllers. 3. No problem with respect to the coding clarity. ,1194560,-1,8022
"The quality of the code is impeccable. Use of helper files and establishing a specific user through ""def current_user"" function in the application helper allowed the team to use a common user parameter throughout the application development and reduced the amount of effort that would have been needed other wise. ",1191252,-1,8022
 Code is very much readable. There are proper comments before the functions.,1194059,-1,8022
"The code is well written. It is neat and easily readable. The function calls are very well done. Also, there is no bad naming the project. Code very well follows the DRY approach.",1193891,-1,8022
"Confusing method naming: eg can_create, can_edit, can_destroy etc all should return true/false, but itredirects requests as well, which should be done in the parent method which calls them  ",1180234,1,8022
COde quality seems to be very good. Documentation aloong with instructions are present.,1193370,-1,8022
Mapping has been properly implemented.,1194562,-1,8022
The database design is close to perfect. The destroy and delete dependencies have also been well managed to allow deletion in cases where a house hunter gets deleted and all its inquiries are deleted automatically.,1191254,-1,8022
" Yes, the system does handle the relationships and the mappings are clearly defined.",1194061,-1,8022
I think the system handles the 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships well. The relationships are clearly defined with no problems. ,1193893,-1,8022
This system handle the 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships,1180236,-1,8022
"The code on Github has 1-to-n relationship between real estate company and realtor. It also facilitates realtors to create real estate companies of their own. My doubt is whether the realtor can view, update and delete the real estate company created by him, because I could not find such a functionality implemented in the application as well as the code.",1189481,1,8022
"Kind off. I felt that admin should have been able to delete the company irrespective of the realtors belonging to the company. I felt that that scenario should have been handled in one of the following ways:- 1. Realtor associated to the company should be deleted, obviously not preferable. 2. Realtor continues to exist but without the company and thereby no houses or inquiries assigned to him.",1193372,1,8022
The above case is covered.,1194565,-1,8022
The realtors controller has been very well tested by the team.,1191257,-1,8022
 The test cases are running fine. Clear steps for the same are given in the readme.,1194064,-1,8022
Excellent use of Rspec.,1194516,-1,8022
"Yes, the team has tested thoroughly at least one model and one controller.",1193896,-1,8022
No test cases have been written ,1180239,1,8022
There seems to be no testing done.,1193375,1,8022
There isnt any commit after the first submission.,1194561,-1,8022
"There are several linear commits to show progression of all the functionalities that were added to the project from the beginning. The team had more or less finished their work before round 1 and fixed a few bugs that were not easily discernible, in round 2.",1191253,-1,8022
 There are 136 commits I can see with clear commit messages.,1194060,-1,8022
"By looking at their github page, I could see they submitted their changes actively and also they continued submitting changes in round 2 as well.th",1193892,-1,8022
67 commits by one whereas 26 by the other two I was expecting an even number of commits,1180235,-1,8022
The team has done a good job in submitting changes throughout the project. The team has not committed changes in Round 2.,1189480,1,8022
Very good commiting by entire team. Project was handled well and not messy.,1193371,-1,8022
"Same issues as of first review. Cannot delete company. Reason cited is 'dependent realtor exist'. I suggest that when a company is removed, realtor shouldn't have a company too. Because a realtor can exist without a company in his profile too! Admin cannot edit his/her details",1194563,1,8022
The system has no perceivable issues.,1191255,-1,8022
 Functionalities are working fine. They are well documented in a separate pdf file as well. Even the read me contains clear instructions for setup.,1194062,-1,8022
"I could not find the filters tab in the show houses section for the house hunter. Rest, everything looks great.",1193894,1,8022
Most of the functionalities are working correctly. One necessary feature that is not working as expected is inquiries. There are broken links when admin/realtor tries to view inquiries.,1189482,1,8022
Almost every feature is working as it's supposed to.,1194547,-1,8022
App as a whole works very well. The look and feel of it is also very good. Contributes to a very good overall user experience.,1193373,-1,8022
"Cannot delete company. Reason cited is 'dependent realtor exist'. Realtor is able to delete houses that he created when he was in company A, after changing to company B. When hunter is deleted by admin and inquiries are checked, the page doesnt show up. (deployment error)   Edge cases Company cannot be created without filling all details. This is implemented. Session control : When user signs out from a page and then goes back, the profile page should not be shown (as he is signed out). This should be considered.",1194564,1,8022
The system was able to pass all listed test cases. All the views have been perfectly setup as well and have disabled buttons where needed.,1191256,-1,8022
 There are enough edge cases tested and well documented in the attached pdf file. Could also view the some points to be taken care that are documented in specific cases.,1194063,-1,8022
"The only thing I had trouble with was changing from a house hunter to a realtor and back. It's possible I just missed the option. In my opinion, that is a rather insignificant omission.",1194515,1,8022
"1) If the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses, it would not delete the record, because a dependent realtor exists. 2) The realtor can change his real estate company and he won't be prohibited from removing houses. 3) If admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries, the inquiries will be deleted and house hunter will be removed from the buyers' list.",1193895,-1,8022
"1. When admin tries to delete real estate company that has realtors and house hunters in it, there is an error that says 'Cannot delete record because of dependent realtors'. Since real estate company is a foreign key in the realtor table, the system does not allow the deletion of real estate companies that have realtors under it. 2. When a realtor changes his real estate company, the houses that are listed by him are unaffected. The system also allows the realtor to delete houses listed in the previous company. 3. I was unable to view inquiries after logging in as admin, hence I am not able to inspect the condition of submitted inquiries after the hunter who created the inquiries has been deleted.",1189483,1,8022
Test case 1 could have been handled better.,1193374,1,8022
Code written well with all DRY principles. Methods are simple and clean. Every method contains functions specific functionalities. Methods are simple and clean. Every method contains functions specific functionalities.,1195233,-1,8071
Looks decent.,1189281,-1,8071
"The code in this project generally appears to be readable. Home controller should probably have a different name, just because controllers are generally supposed to be plural, but there is only one home in their website. Their house search controller appears to be in the model section of the project though.",1189122,1,8071
"It would be more modular if realtors, house hunters and admin were a different table. Since they are clubbed under users table, there are many checks performed in most of the views. Cannot identify user names, company names as IDs are displayed. It would be helpful if this can be modified.",1196528,1,8071
Coding standards are followed properly ,1195432,-1,8071
Code is clear and concise with explanatory commits,1194107,-1,8071
Yes. The team kept pushing commits through out the duration of the project. The team even kept pushing commits during round 2. Though it seems like only 2 of the team members did the majority of work.,1195234,1,8071
Yes they did commit changes in round 2. But it seems only one person has contributed in a group of 3,1189282,1,8071
This team continued pushing changes throughout the project.,1189123,-1,8071
"Only one person has committed throughout the project, which looks strange to me. However, there have been regular commits by the person.",1196529,-1,8071
The team kept on committing on the regular bases but needed team collaboration. Mostly commits are from one person.,1195433,1,8071
"The readme file is completed and explicit, so great!",1182740,-1,8071
"Foreign key integration is been done in DB, but as there are no separate active records for user types(hunter, realtor,admin) hence the 1-1,1-many relations are absent.",1195235,1,8071
The mappings are present and clearly defined,1194109,-1,8071
inquiry doesn't seem to belong to a house and there is no table for potential buyes,1189283,1,8071
Yes.,1190905,-1,8071
The relationships appear to be documented correctly here.,1189124,-1,8071
Some of the missing relationships I identified: 1. Company has_many houses 2. House has_many inquiries 3. Realtor has_one company,1196530,1,8071
Active record relationships are missing. All the relations are implemented through code logic.,1195434,1,8071
Could not add a company as a realtor. Also could not attach and display a picture when listing a house. When signing up as house hunter was asked to select a real estate company. The house Interest /interest list feature  has not been implemented. Also the inquiry is not associated with a listed house. Cannot delete real estate companies.,1195236,1,8071
The functionalities are working fine. The input fields in the forms have good explanations for some specific cases.,1194110,-1,8071

Home controller should probably have a different name, just because controllers are generally supposed to be plural, but there is only one home in their website. Their house search controller appears to be in the model section of the project though.",1189122,1,8112
"It would be more modular if realtors, house hunters and admin were a different table. Since they are clubbed under users table, there are many checks performed in most of the views.

Coding standards are followed properly ,1195432,-1,8112
Yes. The team kept pushing commits through out the duration of the project. The team even kept pushing commits during round 2. Though it seems like only 2 of the team members did the majority of work.,1195234,1,8112
Yes they did commit changes in round 2. But it seems only one person has contributed in a group of 3,1189282,1,8112

Yes.,1190905,-1,8112
The relationships appear to be documented correctly here.,1189124,-1,8112
Some of the missing relationships I identified: 1. Company has_many houses 2. House has_many inquiries 3. Realtor has_one company,1196530,1,8112
Active record relationships are missing. All the relations are implemented through code logic.,1195434,1,8112
Could not add a company as a realtor. Also could not attach and display a picture when listing a house. When signing up as house hunter was asked to select a real estate company. The house Interest /interest list feature  has not been implemented. Also the inquiry is not associated with a listed house. Cannot delete real estate companies.,1195236,1,8112

There is no option to change a user's company. 3. There is no interest list for a house hunter. 4. There is no potential buyer's list for a listing.,1196531,1,8112
Basic functionalities are working fine.,1195435,-1,8112
Could not test most of the edge cases as functionalities have not been implemented.,1195237,-1,8112
Many of the edge cases are covered. One issue I found is that the back buttons for admin in the edit admin page and real estate companies page moves in loop.,1194111,1,8112

 No issue found. Classes looks very clean and nicely naming.  ,1193931,-1,8089
sessions.rb create method has 3 large code blocks for the three role types. It would have been better to create separate methods for each type,1180294,1,8089
- No validations have been implemented in any models. - dependent constraints or foreign keys are not checked for destroy action,1186746,1,8089

All commits were on just 2 days before and on the day of submission. It will be helpful to keep committing code at the end of each day or every couple of days so that there is no major issue of merging at the end. Also it ensures that all team members are working on the same copy of code.,1189779,1,8089

Admin cannot create a house and assign it to a company. Admin cannot delete a company.",1195204,1,8035
"It does seem this team tried to address my earlier feedback, but I still experienced several problems. I found the following issues:   I was unable to login as an Admin. Navigation in this app was difficult.  There were not very intuitive links. There were too many clicks to add/remove Interest. The Inquiries listing gave me an error.  This app did not keep track of my session very well. The search Houses only had one ""filter"" ",1192331,1,8035
"1) If a house hunter is interested in a house, there should be only one entry specifying this interest in the database. In this app, the same house hunter can show multiple interests on the same house. This results to duplicates in db and must be handled. 2) After creating an inquiry, clicking on the Back link on the page should re-direct to /houses or which ever page was visited before creating an inquiry. This is not happening. 3) Founded year field of the company table takes any numeric value --- Founded: 465789 4) The house hunter is able to create a company which is not supposed to be an allowed operation. This happens when as a house hunter, I edit profile and choose to be realtor, I get an option to create a company but even without changing the role to realtor.  5) Point 3 holds good for built year field of house table Builtyear: 7598 6) View inquiries feature is not working...throws an error.",1189308,1,8035

"Comments from Round 1 are taken care of.    Delete real estate company crashed. View Inquiry lists inquiries from all houses, including ones that are not under the same company. These should not be accessible to the realtor. He should see only ones from houses in his company.",1195402,1,8035

"1) Admin trying to delete a user that has an inquiry and interested in some house fails as expected but the failure is not graceful.  2) Admin can edit a profile by making a user neither a realtor nor a house hunter and delete that user that has inquiries and interests in/on a house. 3) Admin cannot destroy a company...this operation is throwing error but after updating a company, the company can be destroyed.",1189309,1,8035
Admin not able to delete houses or users or companies. Unable to test a few cases due to these issues. Realtor not able to delete houses. Error page is getting displayed.,1196548,1,8035
Edge cases not handled properly. Company delete crashing until all realtors and houses under it are deleted. House delete crashes until all inquiries on it are deleted.,1195403,1,8035
Enquiries hasnt been tested.,1189175,-1,8035
Tested for a realtor account. The code handles the lifecycle of the user pretty well. ,1195206,-1,8035
"Yes, they tested the user_controller and model",1192333,-1,8035
Cant see a rspec folder.,1194724,-1,8035
Test cases in user model present.,1196549,-1,8035
Thorough testing has been done for user_test.rb and controllers.,1195404,-1,8035
They test 7 different controllers and 7 different models. Vert convincing work.,1180035,-1,8035
Code is well written. All the conventions of the rails framework have been followed. The functions have been properly defined and does only what it is supposed to do.,1195066,-1,8103
"Code is written properly. Simple and clean Every function is simple and has distinguishing work. Did not understand the need of creating MVC for search, photos separately.  Many functionalities could have been merged together and made a defined solution. Eg house search function could have been added in House MVC.",1190303,1,8103
"In general, the code of this system is clean and readable, but there are some problems in it. For example, author didn't handle the interest list properly. When a realtor wants to see the potential buyers of a house, it does not mean he wants to see all the hunters registered in the system. Besides, the realtor can not edit his own profile can change real estate company, because the edit method in the controller is not realized. And in models, some relationships shouldn't appear because one of the model is not created, such as the model house_hunters, which has many queries, but the model query is not created. ",1195890,1,8103
Code is clean and easy to understand. Some unused/unimplemented empty function definitions are there in the files.,1193504,1,8103
"Yes, the changes were committed throughout, but the commit messages could be a bit more descriptive.",1195067,1,8103
The code follows the general guidelines for quality and concept of clean coding. The models and controller were designed with general practice approach using Ruby and Rails coding methodologies.,1186667,-1,8103
functions are not named properly. example getphoto in photos_controller.,1187897,1,8103
"The code is well written. It is neat and easily readable. The function calls are very well done. Also, there is no bad naming the project. Code very well follows the DRY approach.",1193915,-1,8103
Code looks neat and clean.,1191523,-1,8103
The code was committed throughout the project and code was committed in the second round too.,1191524,-1,8103
Yes. Team is continuously pushing changed on the github but not distributed equally among team mates. I could see 81 commits till now.,1190304,1,8103
"This team is keep on submitting their changes throughout the project, and not only one or two members of the team, but all of them are playing a role in this project. Besides, they did commit changes in round 2.",1195891,-1,8103
"By looking at their github page, I could see they submitted their changes actively and also they continued submitting changes in round 2 as well.",1193916,-1,8103
The team committed the changes in round 2 but overall the commits were not consistent.,1183204,1,8103
Yes they committed a lot of code after first review which can be due to the fact it wasn't deployed by review 1. But overall the number of commits is higher than average i believe,1193505,1,8103
yes about 83 commits.,1187898,-1,8103
The team improved upon certain aspects of their code. This included establishing the admin functions and actions as adding new companies and to view various participants involved.,1186668,-1,8103
"Relationships have not been properly defined in the models. For example, in the company.rb file, the relationships have been commented out. Also, in the case of house model, it had only been related to a realtor and not to a real estate company.",1195068,1,8103
Found that company has many users missing House has many inquiries and reply missing.,1191525,-1,8103
"Team has tried implementing relation between model, but they does not seem to work well. deleting one branch of relation does not affect other branch though they are associated. ",1190305,1,8103
"Not really. First of all, as I was mentioned above, the relationship between house_hunter and query didn't handle properly. Second, a realtor should belong to a real estate company, not ""has one"", and the real estate company should has many realtors, and the mapping of two models does not work. The company id of realtors in realtors' list look like a set of random number, which has nothing to do with the table real estate company.",1195892,1,8103
I think the system handles the 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships well. The relationships are clearly defined with no problems.,1193917,-1,8103
Seeing from the schema file the logic seems fine but unable to test it out.,1193506,-1,8103
there is only one relationship in the whole project. Not a good database design. Plus destroying one entity won't delete another as i can see from the code. Rest i am not able to test as i am not able to login other than admin. Not able to register as well.,1187899,1,8103
The code procedure and application justified the 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships between the realtor and house hunter model as well as real estate company and realtor relationship mapped as 1-to-n.,1186669,-1,8103
"No form validation in the create new company page. For example, when 'Founded' field is given as text and updated, it succeeds but the value is saved as a 0. Admin is unable to add new realtors. Throws up an error. Admin is unable to add new house hunters. Throws up an error. Not able to sign up as either a realtor or house hunter. Gives the ""something went wrong error"". Something is wrong with the deployment. Please look into it.  ",1195069,1,8103
Search functionality for houses not found. Asking for company id and realtor id which is difficult for the user to remember. A better would be to associate house based on a company name or add the house to the company associated with the realtor. Admin not able to add realtors. Admin not able add inquiries or reply to inquiries or add himself as a potential buyer. Unable to sign up as a hunter or realtor. Only admin is able to create the users.  ,1191526,1,8103
"1)In the first release there was a issue in user registration. The issue still persists. Team has kept both realtor and house hunter registration on the same page that only allows house hunter to register. 2)Can not register new realtor using registration link. For simpler design, team could have simply give 2 links for 2 types of user registration. 3)Team tried covering many functionalities as compared to last release and succeeded partially. 4)Team has provided admin credentials and admin functionalities are working fine.",1190306,1,8103
"They fix part of the problems showed in round 1. All kinds of user still cannot edit his own profile, even though admin can perform CRUD of hunters and realtors. And the realtor can not replace and create a new company. The hunter can not make inquires and realtor are not able to reply them. Besides, the search filter for the houses are not working. And when a realtor views the house's potential buyers, he/she will see all the hunters registered in the system.",1195893,1,8103
I think the authors did a good job in developing the system. The system is working as it is supposed to work.,1193918,-1,8103
"I am unable to signup so could not login and check for functionalities. But, UI is improved a lot and the confusing sign up page in round 1 is fixed.",1183206,1,8103
"Able to login with admin and use all functionalities . But unable to signup for realtor or househunter it shows the heroku page ""we're sorry something went wrong""",1193507,1,8103
not able to login other than admin. not able to register myself. edit option is not working when admin is trying to edit. inquires/respond to inquiry etc i am not able to test as i am not able to register myself. search not working on heroku but they have mentioned its working in local.,1187900,1,8103
"In the first round, the application was slightly performing better as compared to the final one. The team may have had troubles while merging and unresolved conflicts lead to error pages for signups.",1186670,1,8103
Not able to test as the sign up failed and admin couldn't add users too.,1195070,1,8103
HH is able to view all the other house hunters and their contact details which only admin is designated to view. Major privacy breach. README.md file well written.,1191527,1,8103
"1)Admin is able to delete the company which has houses and realtor associated with it. When you try to edit houses associated with such company, the add button does not perform any action. where in if you try to edit houses, houses get edited successfully. It seems like relation between model and tables is not maintained properly. 2) While creating new houses realtor is asked to enter id of company and realtor.   These id's are back end data with system incremented numbers and not given to user after       registration. Hence we should restrain displaying such back end information to users.  3) Not able to submit inquiry. Posting an inquiry and reply to the inquiry is on same page, visible to house hunter. 4)  With this release team has written README file very well and neatly. Also provided admin credentials.      Below are few major functionalities team can work upon:      a)House hunter can create new company.      b)Can not register as realtor.      c)Search functionality not working.      d)Potential buyer functionality not implemented properly. It does not connect houses with potentials           buyer. It seem like listing all the buyers.       ",1190307,1,8103
"Actually, all these edge cased list above are not realized at all.  And the mapping relationships between the models don't work at all. For example, when I delete a real estate company, and I look back to realtors' list, nothing happened, because the company id in the realtors' list looks like some random number, such as a company id 6, which is not appear in the company list. And so does the house list. ",1195894,1,8103
"1) If the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses, it would not delete the record, because a dependent realtor exists.   2) The realtor can change his real estate company and he won't be prohibited from removing houses.   3) If admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries, the inquiries will be deleted and house hunter will be removed from the buyers' list.",1193919,1,8103
Functionalities work fine but could not find inquiries form after logging as an admin.,1183207,1,8103
"Couldn't check the base cases, edge cases.  Also found high similarity of program2 doc that detailed the requirements with readme ",1193508,1,8103

The edge cases lead to following results : 1. It asks for confirmation before destroying the company. After that the company is deleted even for those with some realtors and houses. 2. Unable to test due to failure for realtor signup. 3. It asks for confirmation before destroying the house hunter account. Unable to test for inquiries due to failure for house hunter signup. 4. The system does not allow new realtor or house hunter to sign up for application.,1186671,1,8103
Models have not been tested. Controllers are partially tested.,1195071,1,8103
No test cases apart from default test cases.,1191528,1,8103
"Team has written test cases , but they need to few more rounds of testing, including positive test cases as well as negative test cases.",1190308,1,8103
"No, they did not write the test code.",1195895,1,8103
"Yes, I feel the team has done pretty well in testing at least one model and one controller.",1193920,-1,8103
"Some very basic testing is done for controllers, nothing in models",1193509,1,8103
"they have just tested signup. controller looks good, but model testing isn't complete.",1187902,1,8103
The team thoroughly tested the Admin model and controller. The tests for admin performed checks for admin functionality to be able to view the list of houses created by the realtors as well as look up for realtors and house hunters information that are involved in application.,1186672,-1,8103
"No, this team has not tested any model. The controller tests does not handle all the cases.",1195661,1,8060
"yes, the code is written in a clean and readable way. Only one task is handled by each method and in case of multiple tasks, function calls have been implemented perfectly. There is no bad naming in this project. Code in model and controller looks fine. Proper spacing of function and its block is done.",1195656,-1,8060
  ,1193958,-1,8060
The code looks comprehensive to a good extent with the usage of clear naming. The naming is done well with attention to the singular and plural nouns for models and controllers. No problem with respect to the coding clarity. ,1196638,-1,8060
"Most of the code follows standards.  But I was not able to verify the complex examples like adding house to interest list, email when a reply is given by realtor as it is not working. In replies_controller.rb avoid using class variable and use instance variable.",1184663,-1,8060
Code is well written.,1180106,-1,8060

"Regular commits were not done. Everything was committed in one commit which should be discouraged. Think about working professionally, you should be committing code ASAP and committing with proper commits and description. Commit also should not be all module at once but individual. ",1184664,-1,8060
"Yes, the team has committed changes in round 2 also. Overall it looks like the codes were pushed to master and one go. Regularly committing the files could have been better.",1194704,1,8060
Yes there are commits in phase 2 as well.,1180107,-1,8060
26 commits with about 10 commits after Round 1.,1194996,-1,8060
26 commits. Last one on 11th Oct,1194958,-1,8060
Some of the relationships are handled in the project.  I can't find the other important association like: 1. company has many houses(why it is commented?) 2. house belongs to a user or a company    ,1195658,1,8060
This relation is handled well.,1196640,-1,8060
  ,1193960,-1,8060
DB design is not taken care of properly. Various mappings between entities have not been established.,1184665,1,8060
DB seems well designed. I didn't see potential buyers. That will have a relation with house such that house has many potential buyers.,1180108,1,8060
"The company, house, inquiry, user etc mapping is done well and according to the functionalities.",1194997,-1,8060
"Yes, all the DB relationships are handle properly.",1194959,-1,8060
"There are some functionalities which needs to be implemented. Areas you should focus on are destroy is not working correctly in some cases,application is getting crashed again and again. admin should not be deleted by user. how is house associated with a company is something which I was not able to understand.  ",1195659,1,8060
"House images look broken. Destroying a company does not work, instead leads to edit company page.  ",1196641,1,8060
"Realtor can not have no company, realtor is forced to join one of the real estate companies. As a realtor I can not destroy the company I create, and only first real estate company on the index page has navigation buttons. And any realtor can edit the first real estate company which is not own by them. floor number can be negative. house image can only read local images, those houses created by other can not be seen. you can not create an account that has both realtor and househunter role. Househunter can not send inquiry in a house, it shows up an error said house must be exist.   ",1193961,1,8060
Issues - Able to create admin accounts. View Inquiry is failing for HouseHunter. No way to see interested house list.,1184666,1,8060

"First round their login functionality wasnt working, it is working now as expected",1194706,-1,8060
"The developers have put in dropdowns for role selection and company selection making the interface more intuitive. The application broke in Heroku when I tried to login though it might be a Heroku specific error. The login/signup buttons on the landing page don't seem to work. In fact, none of the buttons seem to work, and I am not even getting the hand pointer as you have mentioned in the readme.",1180109,1,8060
"As a hunter, I get a ""View house inquiries"" button but the system crashes when I click on it.",1194998,1,8060
"When admin try to delete a user, the website return some error. When the admin try  to delete a real estate company, it just redirect to the edit route instead of delete the company ",1194960,1,8060
"Here is something which needs to be focused: 1. I can't see the association between company and houses.  2. Deletion of company by admin is redirecting to show.html.erb and not deleting the company. 3. I'm not able to view the inquiries too. In most of the views, deletion is not working.",1195660,1,8060
"Deleting a house hunter does not work, possible error in deployment.   Edge cases Company cannot be created without filling all details. This is implemented. Session control : When user signs out from a page and then goes back, the profile page should not be shown (as he is signed out). This should be considered.",1196642,1,8060
"destroy does not work at all, it will redirect user back to edit page of the object for houses and real estate companies. For users, if they have a foreign key association with any inquire, then you can not delete them. ",1193962,1,8060
Mapping of a house to a company is missing. Realtor Company mapping is also missing. Destroy feature for a house is not working,1184667,1,8060

Few edge cases not working.,1180110,-1,8060

It seems some destroy function have some issue. ,1194961,-1,8060
Does not tell about how to run test ,1193963,1,8060
Only auto-generated test cases are present,1184668,-1,8060

" Commenting was pretty weak in the files I looked through. Overall code style looked pretty good though, I scanned through the files and nothing caught my eye as poor.",1188471,1,8028
"From what I can tell, code quality in this application is good. Functions generally look small and there is good use of rails utilities.",1191531,-1,8028
"Code is written properly. One method is covering only one functionality. Also for more features, team has created new controllers. Hence I can conclude code is neat and readable.   ",1189178,-1,8028
Looks good. There are some files which are misleading like Realtors folder has edit_company file which is blank. Also the readme.md file is missing the Admin Login Details.,1189273,1,8028
"Overall, code is clean and readable. Naming and project structure is consistent with good practices. One issue that stood throughout the code is that authorization is done directly in controller methods. It would be better if this common functionality was moved to a separate function call (e.g. validating user's role in houses_controller#create method)",1184338,1,8028
The code is clean.,1195091,-1,8028
Great code writing habit.,1196776,-1,8028
"There are new commits, however the quality of commit messsages is terrible. Commit message should have a short description of what was changed not just be random words like foo1, foo2 or hasdfsdsd.",1188472,1,8028
Yes they did.,1191532,-1,8028
Yes team had been pushing changes on github continuously with neat commit messages in Round 2 also.  With 49 commits till now. Yes i can see last commit on 11 th Oct 2018. But commits are not distributed equally.,1189179,1,8028
Although branching strategy was followed. The commits mostly seem to be made on the second-last and last day of submission. It will be helpful to keep committing code at the end of each day or every couple of days so that there is no major issue of merging at the end. Also it ensures that all team members are working on the same copy of code.,1189274,1,8028
"Yes, changes we committed in round 2. Code commit could have better by committing as soon as possible. Committing few files and writing proper comments and description for the commit was missing.

"The team continued to make changes in round 2 on a regular basis. However, naming should have been more descriptive. In many cases it is not possible to understand the scope of the commit. One team member's work is not reflected in GitHub's contributors panel. I would suggest fixing this by matching user's credentials of local machine and remote server.",1184339,1,8028
Yes.,1196777,-1,8028
 All the mapping looks good. Nice job,1188473,-1,8028

"Team has Mapped house, realtor, company also house hunter, inquiries well in the model.  ",1189180,-1,8028
The Schema is very well defined. Most of the suggestions provide as part of initial review are incorporated. The relationships are defined correctly and use of dependent destroy ensures that child records are deleted before parent record. This ensures there is consistency.,1189275,-1,8028
Implemented the mappings properly.,1184572,-1,8028
This system handles all relationships properly by using has_many/belongs_to constructs correctly and addition of relevant foreign key attributes in the appropriate tables.,1184340,-1,8028
Yes,1196778,-1,8028
Unable to create a new house,1189149,1,8028
" The system now has the basic functionality that was missing last time like logging in. Good job on the fixes. It crashed when as a realtor I attempted to create a house, telling me to check the logs for more information if I was the owner. Still no information on an admin user listed in the github readme though.",1188474,1,8028
"There were many missing pieces of functionality. I note them below:  I was unable to create a House as an Admin.  I get an error when attempting to search for Houses.  As an Admin,I was unable to update or create a Realtor, though I could delete them. As an Admin, I shouldn't be able to set the password of a Realtor or House Hunter, that is a security vulnerability.  I was unable to create a House Hunter as an Admin. When signing up as a Realtor, I shouldn't be given the list of companies to join before signing up. This is a security vulnerability. As a realtor, I was unable to create a new company.  As a Realtor, I was unable to list a new house. ",1191534,1,8028
"1. Team has worked well compared to last release on UI and tried to cover up all the functionalities. 2.  I still can not see Admin credentials in ReadMe file, ReadMe file only states there will be only one admin in the system. Hence can not review admin functionalities. 3.  I am not able to create house using realtors login as well. It seems code only support specific inputs for house creation and i am not able to find those specific inputs. 4. Hence can not perform many other functionalities reviews from house hunter also.  ",1189181,1,8028
"Admin Login Details are not present in Readme.md file. Atleast Untill now. It may be a case of wrong Readme file commited at the last moment. I have looked into the seeds.rb file and got the admin details from there. Do make changes in the Readme file. Things which needs to be corrected: 1) Admin Should not be able to edit any of his details apart from his name. 2.) Editing a company should only update it (which is working fine). The message shown to user says a new company is created which is slightly misleading. Will be a very small message change. 3) Creating and Viewing Houses Functionality not working currently. gives Application error with message check logs for more details. 4) Admin is able to create Realtor and House Hunter. But once I delete some users and then click on Realtor's Account or House Hounter's Account options given on the UI, it throws Application error same as above. Can you explain about about why this buttons are given and what should it exactly do?   5) Admin is able to delete himself from users/househunters/realtors list. This should not be allowed. 6) Not able to check Potential Buyers and Interests functionality as Admin, as creating or view house is not functioning currently. May be you can check the logs. Might be a small deployment error like get/ post methods misplaced. 7) For Realtor and HouseHunter Signup, it should be allowed to sugnup without specifying company or other details except name, email, password as per the usecase given. This is not allowed currently. 8) No houses are currently present and Not able to create a new house. It gives the same error as it does with Admin Login. So not able to test Potential buyers, Intersest and Deletion functionalities for it.  ",1189276,1,8028

"Most of the edge cases pertain to houses/inquiries/users. This cannot be tested if houses are not present in the system. Houses can be added through admin, realtor or seed. I would suggest fixing at least admin or realtor functionality or using seed for populating data.",1184342,1,8028
 The admin model is tested however this seems silly as creation of admin accounts doesn't really matter as it is not possible. They are supposed to be predefined. The admin controller has a very extensive list of tests. Very good work here.    ,1188476,1,8028
"Test cases seem to be written neatly. It seems team has spent most of the time on coding, I would request team to perform rounds of negative test cases that might help them avoid functionalities fail and system credentials.

"The code employed good naming and seemed to be DRY and follow standard Ruby on Rails practices. The methods were kept short. HouseInterestList would make more sense as HouseInterest. Each row in the table is one wish list entry, not a list of wish list entries.",1195217,1,8171
Every action has a different definition written. The code is well structured.,1195648,-1,8171

Team understands MVC architecture very well, But i could see controller for every functionality , where in such functionalities could have been handled with mere methods in other main controllers.   ",1192107,-1,8171
"No bad naming, handles multiple tasks with multiple function calls.",1190311,-1,8171

"The functionalities of interest list and inquiries are implemented in a crude way, i.e. by creating a drop down for a listings. It becomes very tedious for the user to go and choose a house from hundreds of listings every time to just add it to a interest list. A better way would have been by creating an option of adding to the interest list where user can see all the listings. Adding a user to interest list does not add the buyer a to a house's potential buyer's list. There is no option for viewing potential buyers.",1187425,1,8171
"Nicely implemented code. Used ruby delegations appropriately, and the code is very readable.  However, a few things can be improved.  for eg, in inquiriy_replies_controller, flash[] is used to transfer data from the new method to the params method, which is not the correct way. Also, I believe that the implementation can be made more efficient by reducing the number of database hits. For example, in almost all the controllers, there are redundant database hits: User.find(session[:id]).role_type == ""buyer"" could have been identified during login. A second hit to identify the role type or any such info can be avoided. For a small test database, this would not show any performance decrease but as the records increase the pages will become exponentially slower.   Maybe you can store these in memory [Session?], which would reduce time taken significantly at a small memory overhead.",1183916,1,8171

"Inquiries and house interest lists should not belong to companies. They belong to houses which belong to companies. Also, a user should not have many companies. This is possible with the database and model configuration. Otherwise, the relationships were properly implemented.",1195219,1,8171
Mappings are mentioned appropriately,1195650,-1,8171
"Team has handled 1 to n and n to n relationship very cleanly. Not only in code, but also the related functionalities are working great except few. Like I can not see realtor associated with any company.  ",1192109,-1,8171

"The database handles all the relationships very well. On the downside, there is a flaw in database design - keeping a single user table and single role type means the same email address can not be used for both realtor and house hunter profiles.

"1. User cannot sign up as both Realtor and Hunter, no role switching.  ",1190314,1,8171
"The system is in great shape. It is easily one of the best I have seen, and they still didn't implement all of the expected functionality.",1190322,1,8171
Issues are fixed but creating house from a realtor account breaks in heroku. I am unable to create an account which has same email address for realtor and buyer. Realtor does not have a choose company input field to choose his realtor company.,1185218,1,8171

"Since the first round, authors seem to have progressed a lot, and added most of the missing functionalities. However, following are some of them I found missing: 1.There is no potential buyer's list for a house that can be viewed by a realtor., however there is a link to the house inquiries. 2. I am not able to associate a company to my profile as a realtor. The realtor should be able to work for only one company, however, here I am able to add multiple companies, which should be restricted to admin only. 3. preconfigured admin - unable to login to the system as admin",1187428,1,8171
"Several functionalities are working, however a few of them are still not.  The list is provided below:   A realtor can not see houses which do not have images attached. A realtor can not reply to a specific inquiry, and should not be able to edit inquiries. Realtor and househunter cannot register by same email Id. Admin cannot view all houses or inquiries.

 there is 1-to-n realtionship between company and realtors ,1186748,-1,8089
The system handles the 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships properly. The real estate company and realtor relationship mapped as 1-to-n.,1190834,-1,8089
"The DB design is incomplete. Although it has the correct 1-to-n or n-to -n relationship, it doesn't have any kings of validation. ",1195013,1,8089
All the basic functionalities have been implemented. Team as whole have worked really hard to make common functionality work.,1195877,-1,8089
"The necessary functionalities are implemented. The README file explains how to access some of these functionalities also. However, the company listings appear even before the realtor chooses a company. This shouldn't happen",1194903,1,8089
There was no functionality implemented during 1st review. So there is a drastic improvement. However there are some functionalities which need further improvements. 1)Admin has no option to post or view houses.2)Admin is not able submit inquiry or reply to inquiries.3) Admin has no option currently to edit his profile. He should be able to edit his name. 4)Multiple Realtors and House Hunters can be created with the same email ID. There is no email or role validation. This will allow a lot of duplicate entries and the app will also be suseptible to attacks by robots. Can be improved by a 2 line validation code in model.5) Password should be encrypted. While entering the details too it should not be displayed as plain text. Can be improved by simply using type as password instead of text  in views. and applying encryption in model so that password is encrypted throughout the application6) Search House Functionality does not work when a new house is created. It shows the same old results.7)Also the description specifies Search by Price Range. But it has only one field to input price. This won't work if the user wants to see a house which is between 1000 to 3000 bucks or any house which is less then 3000 bucks. Since the app shows only houses greater then the price entered.8) Realtor is able to create a house even if he is not associated with a company. 9) Realtor is able to view potential buyers and reply to inquiries for all houses without being associated to a company. There should be a check to ensure that realtor is able to post a house only if he is associated with a company. Also the option to view potential buyers and reply to inquiries should only be enabled for houses which are associated with his company. In case of no company association he should be promted to associate himself with a company or create a new company first.,1189781,1,8089
As a house hunter I am not ,1185502,-1,8089
"realtor can view all houses posted. realtor can create house post without join any company. add picture button is under company instead of house, and it is not working. a house can have negative floor numbers. house search function only shows the first match result instead of all. as a househunter you can edit any company, which is not allow.",1193934,1,8089

The system performs almost all the functionalities that are described as part of the deliverables. One specific issue that was suggested and resolved was mapping the realtor to a real estate company.,1190835,-1,8089
"The househunter can edit the company, which is odd.    ",1195014,1,8089
The system doesn't check all edge cases. A realtor can see company listings even without choosing a company. The README does not outline exactly how all edge cases are handled,1194904,1,8089
"Along with the above improvements some of the things you might want to take care of are: Even if a company is deleted the houses and inquires remain as it is. (Partial reason is the above bug which allows to create a house and post reply without being associated to any company).When I try to delete a house it shows application error. So not able to test if dependent child records for potential buyers and house hunters are deleted or not. For Realtor and HouseHunter Signup, it should be allowed to signup without specifying company or other details except name, email, password as per the usecase given. This is not allowed currently.",1189782,1,8089
" you can not destroy any real estate company, realtor, or househunter as admin with any realtor, house, or inquire, it will just throw an error. you can have negative floors for house. readme file does not tell anything about edge cases.  ",1193935,1,8089
What will happen if the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses?: App crashes What will happen if admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries?: App crashes,1180298,1,8089

The result of edge cases are : 1. The admin cannot delete real companies with realtors and house hunters. 2. The realtor can change real estate company. They ill be prohibited though from viewing previous company listings. 3. The house hunter account along with their inquiries are removed from the system. 4. The realtor account links to a real estate company with 1-to-n mapping.,1190836,1,8089
"When try to delete a user with inquiry, it return some error. ",1195015,1,8089

No test cases have been written ,1180239,1,8042
"The quality of the code is impeccable.

Very good commiting by entire team. Project was handled well and not messy.,1193371,-1,8042
"Kind off. I felt that admin should have been able to delete the company irrespective of the realtors belonging to the company. I felt that that scenario should have been handled in one of the following ways:- 1. Realtor associated to the company should be deleted, obviously not preferable. 2. Realtor continues to exist but without the company and thereby no houses or inquiries assigned to him.",1193372,1,8042
App as a whole works very well. The look and feel of it is also very good. Contributes to a very good overall user experience.,1193373,-1,8042
Test case 1 could have been handled better.,1193374,1,8042
There seems to be no testing done.,1193375,1,8042
The code looks comprehensive to a good extent with the usage of comments and clear naming. 1. Adding the remove from wish list feature is a plus point. 2. The naming is done well with attention to the singular and plural nouns for models and controllers. 3. No problem with respect to the coding clarity. ,1194560,-1,8042
There isnt any commit after the first submission.,1194561,1,8042
Mapping has been properly implemented.,1194562,-1,8042
"Same issues as of first review. Cannot delete company. Reason cited is 'dependent realtor exist'. I suggest that when a company is removed, realtor shouldn't have a company too. Because a realtor can exist without a company in his profile too! Admin cannot edit his/her details",1194563,1,8042
"Cannot delete company. Reason cited is 'dependent realtor exist'. Realtor is able to delete houses that he created when he was in company A, after changing to company B. When hunter is deleted by admin and inquiries are checked, the page doesnt show up. (deployment error)   Edge cases Company cannot be created without filling all details. This is implemented. Session control : When user signs out from a page and then goes back, the profile page should not be shown (as he is signed out). This should be considered.",1194564,1,8042
The above case is covered.,1194565,-1,8042
Almost every feature is working as it's supposed to.,1194547,-1,8042
The team has done a good job in submitting changes throughout the project. The team has not committed changes in Round 2.,1189480,-1,8042
"The code on Github has 1-to-n relationship between real estate company and realtor. It also facilitates realtors to create real estate companies of their own. My doubt is whether the realtor can view, update and delete the real estate company created by him, because I could not find such a functionality implemented in the application as well as the code.",1189481,1,8042
Most of the functionalities are working correctly. One necessary feature that is not working as expected is inquiries. There are broken links when admin/realtor tries to view inquiries.,1189482,1,8042
"1. When admin tries to delete real estate company that has realtors and house hunters in it, there is an error that says 'Cannot delete record because of dependent realtors'. Since real estate company is a foreign key in the realtor table, the system does not allow the deletion of real estate companies that have realtors under it. 2. When a realtor changes his real estate company, the houses that are listed by him are unaffected. The system also allows the realtor to delete houses listed in the previous company. 3. I was unable to view inquiries after logging in as admin, hence I am not able to inspect the condition of submitted inquiries after the hunter who created the inquiries has been deleted.",1189483,1,8042
"The only thing I had trouble with was changing from a house hunter to a realtor and back. It's possible I just missed the option. In my opinion, that is a rather insignificant omission.",1194515,1,8042
Excellent use of Rspec.,1194516,-1,8042
"The code is well written. It is neat and easily readable. The function calls are very well done. Also, there is no bad naming the project. Code very well follows the DRY approach.",1193891,-1,8042
"By looking at their github page, I could see they submitted their changes actively and also they continued submitting changes in round 2 as well.th",1193892,-1,8042

"Yes, the team has tested thoroughly at least one model and one controller.",1193896,-1,8042
 Code is very much readable. There are proper comments before the functions.,1194059,-1,8042

" Yes, the system does handle the relationships and the mappings are clearly defined.",1194061,-1,8042
 Functionalities are working fine. They are well documented in a separate pdf file as well. Even the read me contains clear instructions for setup.,1194062,-1,8042
 There are enough edge cases tested and well documented in the attached pdf file. Could also view the some points to be taken care that are documented in specific cases.,1194063,-1,8042
 The test cases are running fine. Clear steps for the same are given in the readme.,1194064,-1,8042
"Well written and able to follow. However, I see no branches created (and hence pull requests merged). All work is pushed direct to master.",1180337,-1,8120
seems alright.,1189321,-1,8120
All methods and classes are well designed and serve well defined functionality. Good job! Could have named the methods and variables a little better. Each function performs a single task. Every method is short and to the point i.e does not contain many nested blocks or if.,1195824,1,8120

"Project name could have been better. Methods were kept small. Comments were left out in some controllers/views. If-else blocks weren't properly indented in some cases. Hard-coded numbers were used for comparisons. A better way is to create enums representing different values(such as roles) and using those enums in code. This way, something like if role == 2 becomes if role == REALTOR and thus is more clear.  ",1194067,1,8120
Good code writing. ,1196760,-1,8120
Good coding practices have been followed. Methods are crisp and single responsibility paradigm has been implemented.,1192497,-1,8120
Submitted well within deadline!,1180338,-1,8120
yes they did.,1189322,-1,8120
The team was regular in committing changes. The team continued to work in round 2 and made regular progress. All members contributed significantly. Great job! Could have started the project a bit earlier.,1195825,-1,8120

"Realtor- house- inquiry relationship deleting realtors shouldn't delete houses and inquires. Interests shouldn't have been defined on the User model. Company has_many users-> Hunter doesn't belong to company.

They missed some relation such as house and inquires 1-n relation.,1196762,1,8120
Relationship between user and company is vague. There is a separate realtor_accounts table. So users seems to be house_hunters. And house hunter does not need to have a relationship with company.,1192499,1,8120
"I was able to post house without any data filled in form. House got created successfully. Likewise for company. Phone number validation missing in Sign Up. Sort by Sqft, Price and floors are failing (going to error page) Applying price range filter and clicking once is giving expected result. Clicking on it again is resetting the filter. Could try to retain the applied filter on the html select option. When I tried to view a non-existent house manually by changing URL (example https://calm-forest-11598.herokuapp.com/house_lists/1000), I got the default Ruby error screen (""The page you were looking for doesn't exist"").  Could do a redirect to browse page :) (https://calm-forest-11598.herokuapp.com/house_lists/)   Tried to update an old inquiry. got a new page that says ""Invalid Access"" as well as ""Inquiry was successfully updated""!",1180340,1,8120
min can still be greater than max in house filter,1189324,1,8120

Most of the functionalities are implemented but I am not able to login as an admin using username password combination mentioned in readme. ,1183172,1,8120
Yes most of the required features are working fine. Some errors are there like Admin is able to add interest to houses which is an unintended feature as admin should change role before doing that.,1191510,1,8120
First reviews comments were fixed.  ,1194070,-1,8120

"The readme document clearly mentions the edge cases when a company is deleted, what happens to the houses and realtors.",1194691,-1,8120
Edge cases like real estate company deletion are handled as deletions which is basically not handling it. Could've done some case like transferring them to other user account or such.,1191511,-1,8120
house search not working- able to keep fields like price blank during new house creation I was getting inquiry- invalid access on replying to an inquiry but it did save to the database.   high-low links in  houses table erroring for realtor admin was able to add to interest list admin able to reply to queries hunter shouldn't have contact method authentication not applied throughout the app- https://calm-forest-11598.herokuapp.com/companies/42 accessible without login,1194071,1,8120

Models and controllers are well tested. All edge cases are covered and tests are comprehensive. The inquiries controller is especially well tested. All assert statements are well thought of. ,1195829,-1,8120
Yes. the team has thoroughly tested.,1183174,-1,8120
The test only validates cases with valid attributes,1194692,-1,8120
Most common cases are tested in controllers. They are using fixtures for testing ,1191512,-1,8120
"Yes, they used Rspect to test the code.",1196765,-1,8120
"Yes, they have tested a controller but not the model.",1192502,1,8120
Code quality is impressive. Every action has a different function call. The methods are well defined to understand to purpose it serves.,1195201,-1,8088

There are plenty of relations mentioned in the model files. For the mentioned case as well.,1196546,-1,8088
There is a search.rb which seems very vague and unused. It has an extensive search logic. It should be a method in the house.rb file instead of a separate file of its own.,1195401,1,8088
"1) If a house hunter is interested in a house, there should be only one entry specifying this interest in the database.

Admin not able to delete houses or users or companies. Unable to test a few cases due to these issues. Realtor not able to delete houses. Error page is getting displayed.,1196548,1,8088
Edge cases not handled properly. Company delete crashing until all realtors and houses under it are deleted. House delete crashes until all inquiries on it are deleted.,1195403,1,8088
Enquiries hasnt been tested.,1189175,1,8088
Tested for a realtor account. The code handles the lifecycle of the user pretty well. ,1195206,-1,8088

The Inquiries listing gave me an error.  This app did not keep track of my session very well. The search Houses only had one ""filter"" ",1192331,1,8088

"The code is clean and easy to follow and each method handles one task. I could not understand the reason for some of the code, like the home action in the hunters_controller - the current user's role is set to 3 without any checks.

Clean and nice code. But lack of ReadMe.,1195041,1,8038
Submitted changes throughout the project. Committed changes in round 2.,1190588,-1,8038
 There are no any submission for round 1.  ,1180476,1,8038
"Yes, timely commits",1189733,-1,8038
I see 1 big commit with all the files which is the first commit and 19 very small other commits done in round 2. ,1180227,-1,8038
There are some commits around 19hrs ago. Most commits are 6-7 days prior.,1180039,-1,8038
"Compared to other teams that I have reviewed, there are fewer commits here and some are recently committed on Oct 15. ",1196537,-1,8038
The team did not seem to submit their changes throughout the project. The team have made changes only after round 1 and nothing on round 1. There are a total of 19 commits. It would have been better if the commits have been made with messages so that others can know what changes have been made in the project. ,1180433,1,8038
Not every member of team contributed. Could see some commits after the deadline of round2.  ,1186977,1,8038
29 commits total. Only one user contribute to it.,1195042,1,8038
 relationship looks good in both models and schema.  ,1180477,-1,8038
Yes all relationships properly defined in the model,1189734,-1,8038
The db is well designed and relationship mappings are proper.,1180040,-1,8038
This application handles 1-n and n-n relationships properly. Company-realtor has 1-n relationship in the mapping table. I could not find any problem related to relationships. ,1180434,-1,8038
No schema or relations are implemented.,1186978,-1,8038

Please provide the deployment link,1180230,1,8038
Readme.md does not mention anything with respect to edge cases. The linking is not intuitive. You have provided back buttons in quite a few places which redirect to that entities index.html.erb page instead of redirecting to the actual page I came from. Suggestion is put in a button for menu and link the menu to the starting page of the currently logged in entity. This will make things simpler.,1180042,1,8038
The project is implemented incorrectly and is incomplete. ,1196540,-1,8038
"The README.md file has not been updated hence it does not provide the instructions regarding this system. It does not mention how the system handles the edge cases. Since there is no heroku link given, I cannot test the system for edge cases and also the README.md file does not specify any details.",1180436,1,8038

No. Edge cases not tested.,1189737,1,8038
Only ba,1180231,-1,8038
The tests are the normal ones generated by scaffold.,1180043,-1,8038
tests are written for the controllers.,1196541,-1,8038
The team has tested controller but not model. ,1180437,1,8038
No test cases are implemented.,1186981,1,8038
No model has been tested.,1195046,1,8038
The code is clean and readable. ,1189297,-1,8027
Code looks quite readable,1194051,-1,8027
looks alright.,1190753,-1,8027
The code generally is simple and understandable. Blocks are simple but maybe its because few features are missing.,1190658,1,8027
-No validations implemented on the model's attributes. - The models do not have associations implemented. ,1196678,1,8027
The code is clean and well written. The controllers and models are named accurately and each filename describes the desired functionality. Good work on that!,1187150,-1,8027
Code looks good. The first cut for good too.  I still do not see code for models in model files if an additional gem has been used it would be good to mention that in readme,1195808,1,8027
The commits were regularly till round 2.,1189298,-1,8027
I could see commits in round 2 as well.,1194052,-1,8027
yes. 67 commits,1190754,-1,8027
Yes the team kept pushing their updates even in round 2,1194496,-1,8027
Yes there are commits after round 1 review but by review 1 the project wasn't working and hence these commits are probably partially to make it work in the first place.,1190659,-1,8027
Fewer commits compared to other teams that I have reviewed.,1196679,1,8027
The team has contributed to the repo regularly. All the team members have contributed to the project in the second phase. The system has improved a lot as compared to the previous version.,1187151,-1,8027
"Yes, lot of code has been checked in post 1st cut",1195809,-1,8027
No For e.g house should belong_to a real estate company but its not handled in house.rb,1189299,1,8027
Could not really find the required relationship mapping.,1194053,1,8027
No mapping table present anywhere. No belongs to/ has_many relationship present in the models,1190755,1,8027
No mapping table was found. ,1190660,1,8027
There is no association between models.,1196680,1,8027
"The system properly handles the relationships where a real estate company can have multiple realtors. Also, it supports a realtor to create multiple houses and the house hunters to add multiple houses to their interest list.",1187152,1,8027
"I am unable to find many relationships in the model, though functionality seems to be in place either additional gems have  been used or code has been pushed in schema.db which is wrong.   ",1195810,1,8027
Since the last time they have improved a lot. The basic functionalites are working.,1189300,-1,8027
Admin has a separate login url and cannot login from the same page as other users. Admin panel could be made a little more user friendly by separating links on different lines.,1194054,1,8027
admin requires a separate url to  login.,1190756,1,8027
"While signing up as realtor or HouseHunter, all fields are not present. Only username and password is being asked.",1194498,1,8027
Basic functionalities are working in the sense that able to add users but many features are missing. Unable to use same email id for realtor and househunter  Admin is not able to edit house records Realtor cant view other realtors Real Estate Company info not there for any house therefore it invalidates many requirements,1190661,1,8027
"- Admin cannot create new house, it redirects to error page. - Realtors cannot reply to inquiries.",1196681,1,8027
"The system performs all the desired functionalities. A shoutout to the idea for the auto filled inquiries. I really liked that feature where the inquiry is already filled after which the user gets an option to edit the inquiry. Some parts need improvement. For ex: The link ""new houses"" in the house list redirects to the  users/edit link. Its a minor issue which could be looked upon. The layout of the homepage for house-hunter can be fixed as links overlap each other. Also, the houses list shows edit/destroy options for the entire house list, that's a bug which needs fixing.",1187153,1,8027
"Yes, 1st cut did not have heroku link, this time apart from additional code + link is present and may of non functional flows seems to be in place",1195811,-1,8027
Certain test cases are not possible to test due to the way edit realtor is implemented. The website takes real estate company id and not name for update. Being a user I wouldn't know the company id and hence won't be able to perform the right test,1189301,1,8027
"The basic test cases mentioned in the read me work fine. It does not cover the edge cases as mentioned above, but some of the validations I tried seem to have worked.",1194055,1,8027
Deleting company doesn't delete it's houses. No form of cascade delete present anywhere.,1190757,1,8027
Many normal cases are failing as told in previous case hence the edge cases specified are not even applicable,1190662,1,8027
"Unfortunately, most of the test cases failed while testing  The realtor does not get deleted from the system after the deletion of his/her respective real estate company. The link to create new houses redirects to a different link, hence I was not able to create new houses and test certain cases The inquiries submitted by the house hunter remain in the database even after the deletion of the house hunter All the inquires of the particular house are shown to every realtor, which is not an ideal case  These are some of the cases that need attention. Owing to the work done on remainder of the project, these changes would be implemented easily with some effort  ",1187154,1,8027
Few issues that I found were : 1. different logins for different type of users 2. how does realtor switch roles between user and realtor  ,1195812,1,8027
As mentioned in the read me file the inquiry controller and the admin model have been tested thoroughly,1194056,-1,8027
No model or controller has been tested.,1190758,-1,8027
They've tested one controller thoroughly and one basic feature of admin model is tested ,1190663,-1,8027
Admin model has only two tests.  ,1196683,1,8027
The user and realtor roles are tested to prevent any abnormal occurrences during the sign-up. Good work on that.,1187155,-1,8027
1. tests are too few for models 2. integration tests missing   ,1195813,1,8027
The code is very well structured and written with good coding practice.,1195450,-1,8048
"The code quality is fairly standard. The code does follow ""good Ruby and Rails coding practices"". No bad naming. Every file is properly named based on their functionalities. I cannot find issues with coding. One method handles only one task. I could not find any bugs in the system and this works exactly how it is supposed to work.",1187873,-1,8048
"Code is written in an efficient, clean and readable manner. Proper use of data structures like hash maps are used wherever necessary. A proper use of names for controllers, migrations and views can be seen. The names given for controllers properly signifies the tasks performed. The Readme file is thorough and provides all the functionalities implemented in the project",1184722,-1,8048
Project name could have been better  ,1194091,1,8048
Every method is handling only one task and the code is written in a clean and readable manner. The naming conventions are maintained. The code was also very modular. The overall GUI is user friendly.,1180114,-1,8048
The code is written clearly.,1188669,-1,8048
Commits on the repo show updates of functionalities,1195451,-1,8048
"Yes, the commits were very well spread-out throughout the development cycle, which was evident from the quality of the project that was delivered.",1189155,-1,8048
"Checking git log, the team kept submitting their changes throughout the project.",1184331,-1,8048
Yes the team kept on submitting changes throughout the project. The commits also includes messages and descriptions about the changes made. The team still committed changes in round 2.,1187874,-1,8048
"The team has worked hard on the project which is evident by the fact that I can see commits almost daily, throughout the project period. An excellent job on that end.",1184723,-1,8048
"The commits were spread throughout the project duration, however the commit messages could have been more descriptive. The team still made commit changes in round 2 which shows they have proceeded with development. ",1180115,1,8048
They keep commit code until 10-10.,1188670,-1,8048
All known mappings are present,1195452,-1,8048
"The DB was very well designed, and successfully mapped all the required relations effectively.",1189156,-1,8048
"By looking at their model files, relationships are handled well.",1184332,-1,8048
"This system handles the 1-n and n-n relationships properly. The relationships have been set up properly in the model files as well as the schema.  They have also implemented the destroy dependency in the model, hence no error pops out when the parent record is deleted. ",1187875,-1,8048
The team has done praise-worthy work in handling relationships in the system. The real estate company can add multiple realtors as well as the authorization of a particular realtor changes with the change in company.,1184724,-1,8048
User model doesn't have all has_many relations defined,1194093,1,8048
"1-n and n-n relationships are all properly defined between Realtors, Company and Users. ",1180116,-1,8048
They added 1-to-n and n-to-n relationship in the model.,1188671,-1,8048
All functionalities working with a great UI.,1195453,-1,8048
"Yes, the system worked almost perfectly, and there was a huge improvement from the first round. Almost all the issued pointed out after the first round were successfully resolved, especially the bug fixing part and adding the new features. The User experience was also considerably improved throughout the application.",1189157,-1,8048
"Most functionalities are working great. In the first round admin was missing some basic functionalities, now they are present and working. One issue that I came across is that while admin is creating a new company, the system keeps raising an error saying that the website url is invalid and so the users cannot create new company. Maybe, there is something wrong with the validations of Company model. However, when realtor creates the company, this error does not occur.",1184333,1,8048
the inquiry form is not working,1185971,1,8048
The System works without any glitches. The team has been fixing bugs after the review 1 such that it works clean now. I could not find any functionality that is still failing even after trying the edge cases. ,1187876,-1,8048
"The Facebook signup which wasn't working in the previous sign up works properly. The admin, realtor, customer functionalities are working fine and I can see a lot of improvement from the previous version. The realtor can send a receive queries by the customer. However, a small suggestion would be to ask a realtor for the company name while filling the sign up form. Apart from that, the system fulfills all the requirements of the project",1184725,1,8048
Realtor not able to remove their own company from profile Back button missing from some realtor workflows Realtor was able to updated query content,1194094,1,8048
"Most of the functionalities are implemented. However, ""Not a valid URL"" Error message is prohibiting from editing companies under realtors even when given a valid URL. Not able to House Hunter from the users list through admin login. The following error message is displayed.  We're sorry, but something went wrong.  If you are the application owner check the logs for more information. Upload picture UI could have been constructed better because the picture does not fit in the given space.",1180117,1,8048
"Yes, but I find a small bug, the admin can edit his profile and select change his role to realtor, although his role did not change, there is no error report.",1188672,1,8048
Checked on a few tests tuned out to be handled. If an admin deletes either a house/company/user all the dependencies are deleted.,1195454,1,8048
(1): Works perfectly fine (2): The realtor is able to remove previous houses! works like charm (3): Enquiries are not auto-deleted,1189158,1,8048
Edge cases handled well.,1184334,-1,8048
could not test inquiry form,1185972,1,8048
"1) If the admin deletes a company, all the related properties will be deleted and will remove the company name assigned to any realtor. 2) If the realtor changed his or her company, the realtor cannot make changes to old posts which they have posted for the previous company they worked for. So they will not be able to edit,add or remove the houses listed in previous company. 3) If the house hunter is deleted by the admin, all the inquiries by the house hunter will be deleted and their names in the potential buyers list is removed. However, The README.md does not cover how the system handles all these edge cases.",1187877,1,8048
All the edge cases pass. Well done!,1184726,-1,8048
"When an admin deletes a real estate company which has realtors and houses, the company gets is getting deleted along with the realtors which is not the expected functionality because realtors can exist even without being a part of a company. The realtor should not get deleted from the database. Could not test whether the inquiries are deleted if the house hunter is deleted because the admin is unable to delete a house hunter from the Users list.",1180118,1,8048
(1). The realtors and houses will also be deleted. (2). Nothing will happen. (3). Inquires will also be deleted.,1188673,-1,8048
Every functionality is working,1195455,-1,8048
The application seems to have been well tested. Almost all of the test-cases have been appropriately and effectively written. Couldn't find bugs while testing the application too.,1189159,-1,8048
"The team has tested parts of different models and controllers partially, but none of the models/controllers is thoroughly tested for complete functional verification",1184335,1,8048
"did not use Rspec, but team has done testing.",1185973,1,8048
The team has tested a model where user with email and first name should be valid to sign up or sign in. The following tests are meaningful and have the potential to fail  1)when user uses same email to register twice.  2)should not save user with password less than 6 chars. 3)should not save user with invalid email 4)should not save user without email  ,1187878,-1,8048
The code shows that most of the controllers and models were tested.,1184727,-1,8048
"Yes, they have tested a model and a controller. ",1180119,-1,8048
Yes,1188674,-1,8048
Code is well written and organised. All the functions have been objectively defined and does only what it is supposed to do.,1194503,-1,8024
"The code is much clean and readable. All the functions are short and crisp with proper indentation . However, mostly they have tried to embed the functionalities which could have been separate to be in the basic crud functions provided by rails. for eg. here , they haven't maintained a different function for the potential buyer , instead they have used a hash for it which is embedded in the show functionality of the house controller",1189289,1,8024
All methods and classes are well designed and serve well defined functionality. Good job! Could have named the methods and variables a little better. Each function performs a single task. Every method is short and to the point i.e does not contain many nested blocks or if else conditions.,1186984,1,8024
"couldn't relate code with the application - for eg - admin index page has Hello admin at the top, however, there is no such thing on the UI Similarly for inquiries- LIST the Inquiries- not found in UI",1185611,1,8024
Some methods are a bit long and nest quite deep.,1186060,1,8024
Code looks neat. Methods have only one functionality. Well organized.,1188274,-1,8024
The earliest commit is dated around Oct 4.,1194504,-1,8024
Yes they have been committing a bit regularly . Although the commits contribution are not equally distributed among the team members.,1189290,1,8024
The team was regular in committing changes. The team continued to work in round 2 and made regular progress. All members contributed significantly. Great job! Could have started the project a bit earlier.,1186985,1,8024
"All commits happened during round 2, but work was done before.",1186061,-1,8024
Started committing after round 1,1193103,1,8024
"Yes, the team kept commiting the changes throughout the project and also in round 2.",1182225,-1,8024
Yes. Feedback has been accepted and changes made in round 2.,1188275,-1,8024
All the relationships have been properly defined in the models.,1194505,-1,8024
Yes they have properly defined the associations for every table and haven't missed on anything.,1189291,-1,8024
"All dependencies are well modeled and designed. Every model has correctly associated relationships and validations. Your team is a pro! Realtor to house and house to company , other relationships are implemented. Each company has multiple realtors and each realtor can have multiple houses. Everything good here!",1186986,-1,8024
"By looking at their model files, relationships are handled well.",1193104,-1,8024
DB mappings are done well. Cascading delete and cascading nullify implemented to handle delete cases.,1188276,-1,8024
"Don't see the role switch functionality and it's not mentioned in the readme file too. While adding a new house by an admin, it is seen that I can add it to a company, say, A and and also add a realtor, R1, which does not belong in company A, but another company, say, B. So what is the flow here? The end result is the house has a company A, but has a realtor whose company is B.",1194506,1,8024
Not many problem detected . working to the expectations.,1189292,-1,8024
"https://pure-peak-85957.herokuapp.com/houses When this link is opened after registering as a realtor and adding a house, the application crashes. All other basic functionality works well. Great job with the design and methods! The flow of the application could be a bit more clear instead of just listing all the links in  one page.",1186987,1,8024
All functionality seems to be present now.,1186063,-1,8024
"3) The search method is a little long. Some of it could have been extracted to function calls.   Otherwise, the code looks good. Methods were short and names were sensible.",1194976,1,8056
"Most basic functionalities are working. Admin functions of add/delete users is now working well. One issue that I faced: realtor view house listings button not working, so most of the realtor functionalities (as they are dependent on houses) are not working.",1193105,1,8024
code looks clean and neat. UI design looks very good and is elegant. Search functionality for the houses should have been in controllers and not in the model.  ,1191886,1,8056
"Yes, the system works fine and authors have fixed the problems found in the first round. For an instance, Admin functionality and interest functionality were not present in round one but authors have implemented them now. ",1182227,1,8024
"Excellent code! Very well commented and followed most of the Ruby,s standard code formate. Very well organized. ",1195849,-1,8056
Neat code and well arrangement of the views espaciallly the house_style view.,1185944,-1,8056
"Yes most of the issues identified in the Round 1 was fixed apart from below   1) Admin Login : While creating account The UI says password as option, but i am leave them blank 2) Realtor : VIEW Listing is not working as a result realtor is not able to see the inquireis 3) was able to delete the admin account",1189316,1,8024
Code was committed throughout the project and during second round too.  ,1191887,-1,8056
All feedback has been accepted and changes made to fix them.,1188277,-1,8024
"The team committed changes in round 2. However, the changes were not consistently committed throughout the project period.",1187842,1,8056
"The 'View Listings' page for a realtor errors out and does not render when the admin deletes a house hunter who is also a potential buyer for various houses. The inquiries get deleted though, but the application breaks when it comes to handling potential buyers.",1194507,1,8024
Yes: committed are constantly updated till today. README file was updated 3 hours ago. ,1195850,-1,8056
"1] when the admin deletes a real estate company it deletes the house entry but doesnot deletes the realtors entry however, for realtor the company field becomes blank. 2] when the realtor changes his company he is still able to delete and view the companies that he had listed with the previous company. 3] yes the Inquires case is handled properly .  ",1189293,1,8024
"Although the relationships have been properly handled, I see in places with a belongs_to relationship optional:true option is present which allows violation of the relationship and is a bad idea.",1189132,1,8056
"When the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses, all the houses and realtors are deleted as well. This is the expected functionality. Good job! All other test cases work as well. If an admin tries to delete a house hunter with multiple inquiries, all of his/her inquiries are deleted as well.",1186988,-1,8024
All deletion edge cases seem to be accounted for.,1186064,-1,8024
"The schema.rb file should be in the repo. From the models and the migrations, the relationships appeared to be correct.",1194978,1,8056
DB relationships looked fine. New model was created for house style which could have been a parameter in house model itself.,1191888,1,8056
Yes,1195851,-1,8056
"Edge cases handled well.  After hunter adds an inquiry, the ""back"" button goes again to the ""create new inquiry"" form, letting the user recreate the same inquiry multiple times README.md does not cover how the system handles edge cases. ",1193106,1,8024
can't login as admin in the REDAME flie.,1185946,1,8056
"Yes, all the edge cases are handled very well.",1182228,-1,8024
The admin credentials provided don't work and hence no admin functionality can be tested.,1189133,1,8056

No they haven't tested,1189294,1,8024
No testing has been done. I checked the RSpec folder (not present) and no changes have been made to the pre built testing files as well. You could have easily written the tests for the user model and controller just by looking at the cookbook application. Good job overall with the DB validations and checks in the application (for login/logout),1186989,1,8024

There is a one-to-many relationship between User and Company. A realtor model is not applied.,1184237,1,8020
This application handles 1-n and n-n relationships properly. Company-realtor has 1-n relationship in the mapping table. I could not find any problem related to relationships. ,1187010,-1,8020
House hunter and Realtor can easily switch accounts.,1184191,-1,8020
All of the relationships are handled properly in the code.,1189164,-1,8020
The entity relationships have been established properly. They have also implemented cascading delete.,1195349,-1,8020
Image not showing with listed houses. Admin cannot view list of potential buyers. House Hunter also asked for company. House Hunter has the ability to add houses and list companies. This should not happen.,1196633,1,8020
Well done! Most of the functionality I commented on last time has been fixed with very intuitive UI. The only thing I couldn't find still was being able to view all inquiries as an admin. Very good updates overall!,1188569,-1,8020
search is not working  in realtor. I did not see any Rspec in spec folder. while signing up it takes password less than length 6. when realtor adds the property it does not appear in property list.,1185939,1,8020
"Fixed problems: Users can edit their name now. Admin/Realtors can create, select(only one) and change companies. They can edit their own company's information. Admin/Realtors can view/list houses and edit/destroy houses that belongs to his/her company. Realtors can switch roles to house hunter. House hunters can view/add companies info. Inquiries functionality is implemented. Issues: Houses do not show if they have basement or not. After an inquiry is sent, the app redirects to an error page. Looks like house hunters can add company/houses too. These tasks should have been restricted.  ",1184238,1,8020
The search properties and addition of potential buyers needed to be improved and fixed after the first round. The authors fixed all of it for round 2. The system works exactly how it is supposed to work. I could not find any functionalities that are still failing. They have added additional features like signing up with google and sending replies to enquiries via email. ,1187011,1,8020

"1. When the admin deletes a real estate company which has some realtors and houses, (s)he can no longer view the list of other realtors, house hunters and users. The view button redirects to an error page. 2. Admin was able to view realtors/hunters/ users before any deletion happened. After the above step 1, it seems taht admin is unable to view users, realtors and hunters. So, admin cannot delete any users, realtors and hunters.",1184239,1,8020
"1) If the admin deletes a company, all the related properties will be deleted and will remove the company name assigned to any realtor. 2) If the realtor changed his or her company, the realtor cannot make changes to old posts which they have posted for the previous company they worked for. So they will not be able to edit,add or remove the houses listed in previous company. 3) If the house hunter is deleted by the admin, all the inquiries by the house hunter will be deleted and their names in the potential buyers list is removed. The README.md covers how the system handles all these edge cases.",1187012,1,8020

Still have lots of tests across all of the models and controllers but nothing super extensive that attempts to cover all possible cases.,1188571,1,8020
The User model and controller has been tested. It does not test whether the system handles the case that a user uses the same email to register twice.  ,1184240,1,8020
The team has tested both a model and controller. The system can handle the following cases 1)when user uses same email to register twice.  2)should not save user with password less than 6 chars. 3)should not save user with invalid email 4)should not save user without email,1187013,1,8020

There are some cases when decomposition and moving functionality into a separate method would make sense.

Readme does not talk about edge cases but it covers how to to access the website. Good thing is that most of the errors pointed out in the prior review have been taken care of.  Search is missing     ,1195636,1,8125
"1.Admin can only delete a company which has no users(realtors/hunters), else he is unable to delete it. 2.Realtor cannot change his company and can post an ad under any user. 3. House hunter inquiry feature is absent hence could not test this test case.    ",1186758,1,8125
Test cases present for user controller.,1192317,-1,8125
Test Cases are written very well and system is tested well till some extend but many small cases needs to still handled.,1190957,1,8125
Integration tests don't cover authentication,1195637,1,8125
Basic functional test cases are written for four controllers. ,1186759,-1,8125
The code is clean and readable. ,1189297,-1,8098
Code looks quite readable,1194051,-1,8098
looks alright.,1190753,-1,8098
The code generally is simple and understandable. Blocks are simple but maybe its because few features are missing.,1190658,-1,8098
-No validations implemented on the model's attributes. - The models do not have associations implemented. ,1196678,1,8098
The code is clean and well written. The controllers and models are named accurately and each filename describes the desired functionality. Good work on that!,1187150,-1,8098
Code looks good. The first cut for good too.  I still do not see code for models in model files if an additional gem has been used it would be good to mention that in readme,1195808,1,8098
The commits were regularly till round 2.,1189298,-1,8098
I could see commits in round 2 as well.,1194052,-1,8098
yes. 67 commits,1190754,-1,8098
Yes the team kept pushing their updates even in round 2,1194496,-1,8098
Yes there are commits after round 1 review but by review 1 the project wasn't working and hence these commits are probably partially to make it work in the first place.,1190659,-1,8098
Fewer commits compared to other teams that I have reviewed.,1196679,-1,8098
The team has contributed to the repo regularly. All the team members have contributed to the project in the second phase. The system has improved a lot as compared to the previous version.,1187151,-1,8098
"Yes, lot of code has been checked in post 1st cut",1195809,-1,8098
No For e.g house should belong_to a real estate company but its not handled in house.rb,1189299,1,8098
Could not really find the required relationship mapping.,1194053,1,8098
No mapping table present anywhere. No belongs to/ has_many relationship present in the models,1190755,1,8098
No mapping table was found. ,1190660,1,8098
There is no association between models.,1196680,1,8098
"The system properly handles the relationships where a real estate company can have multiple realtors. Also, it supports a realtor to create multiple houses and the house hunters to add multiple houses to their interest list.",1187152,-1,8098
"I am unable to find many relationships in the model, though functionality seems to be in place either additional gems have  been used or code has been pushed in schema.db which is wrong.   ",1195810,1,8098
Since the last time they have improved a lot. The basic functionalites are working.,1189300,-1,8098
Admin has a separate login url and cannot login from the same page as other users. Admin panel could be made a little more user friendly by separating links on different lines.,1194054,1,8098
admin requires a separate url to  login.,1190756,-1,8098
"While signing up as realtor or HouseHunter, all fields are not present. Only username and password is being asked.",1194498,1,8098
Basic functionalities are working in the sense that able to add users but many features are missing. Unable to use same email id for realtor and househunter  Admin is not able to edit house records Realtor cant view other realtors Real Estate Company info not there for any house therefore it invalidates many requirements,1190661,1,8098
"- Admin cannot create new house, it redirects to error page. - Realtors cannot reply to inquiries.",1196681,1,8098
"Yes, 1st cut did not have heroku link, this time apart from additional code + link is present and may of non functional flows seems to be in place",1195811,-1,8098
"The system performs all the desired functionalities. A shoutout to the idea for the auto filled inquiries. I really liked that feature where the inquiry is already filled after which the user gets an option to edit the inquiry. Some parts need improvement. For ex: The link ""new houses"" in the house list redirects to the  users/edit link. Its a minor issue which could be looked upon. The layout of the homepage for house-hunter can be fixed as links overlap each other. Also, the houses list shows edit/destroy options for the entire house list, that's a bug which needs fixing.",1187153,1,8098
Certain test cases are not possible to test due to the way edit realtor is implemented. The website takes real estate company id and not name for update. Being a user I wouldn't know the company id and hence won't be able to perform the right test,1189301,1,8098
"The basic test cases mentioned in the read me work fine. It does not cover the edge cases as mentioned above, but some of the validations I tried seem to have worked.",1194055,-1,8098
Deleting company doesn't delete it's houses. No form of cascade delete present anywhere.,1190757,1,8098
Many normal cases are failing as told in previous case hence the edge cases specified are not even applicable,1190662,1,8098
"Unfortunately, most of the test cases failed while testing  The realtor does not get deleted from the system after the deletion of his/her respective real estate company. The link to create new houses redirects to a different link, hence I was not able to create new houses and test certain cases The inquiries submitted by the house hunter remain in the database even after the deletion of the house hunter All the inquires of the particular house are shown to every realtor, which is not an ideal case  These are some of the cases that need attention. Owing to the work done on remainder of the project, these changes would be implemented easily with some effort  ",1187154,1,8098
Few issues that I found were : 1. different logins for different type of users 2. how does realtor switch roles between user and realtor  ,1195812,1,8098
As mentioned in the read me file the inquiry controller and the admin model have been tested thoroughly,1194056,-1,8098
No model or controller has been tested.,1190758,1,8098
They've tested one controller thoroughly and one basic feature of admin model is tested ,1190663,-1,8098
Admin model has only two tests.  ,1196683,1,8098
The user and realtor roles are tested to prevent any abnormal occurrences during the sign-up. Good work on that.,1187155,-1,8098
1. tests are too few for models 2. integration tests missing   ,1195813,1,8098
"Well written code, clean and easy to read.",1184251,-1,8124
I really appreciate the organization of your code. Everything is grouped in appropriate folders and easy to navigate. I also like how most of your code is indexed and spaced. Great readability. Functions are clearly written to handle exactly what the name indicates. There are a few places where the continuation of parameters should be realigned (examples: company_params in Companies Controller and format of website in Company model). Overall great use of Ruby styling standards.,1180542,1,8124
Short methods - Good. project structure - good. I feel you haven't committed everything to GIT. Please check that.,1184703,1,8124
"The code is written very cleanly. The only slight problem I found was the ""search"" method in Houses_controller is too long as it has a lot of nested if statements.",1194576,1,8124
Changes were committed only at the last moment at once. Please commit the changes as soon as development is complete and the code is tested.,1184704,1,8124
"Checking the git log, the team still committed changes in round 2.",1184252,-1,8124
"Changes to application continued throughout the second round of project submissions. Many of the commits deal with the adding additional functionality to the company controller, as well as, additions to the ReadMe. I can see that good work was made toward implementing missing functionality from the first round of submission.",1180543,1,8124
I see only 1 contributor. Also only once the commit was made.,1184198,1,8124
They committed quite many changes on the day of submission.,1194577,-1,8124
Many appropriate relationships are implemented. (a) companies(1) to houses(n) (b) house(1) to photo(1) and (c) house(1) to possible buyers(n) . I believe there should also be an association with how there a realtor can only belong to one company. This will ensure many necessary functional dependencies are in place for the required application flow. Keep the ones you have and continue to add missing associations as you go through the requirements check.,1180544,1,8124
User model doesn't include any relationship with other models.,1184253,1,8124
"Not able to see the mapping between inquiries and houses.  Also, not able to see mappings between potential buyers and houses.  Did you forget to commit? Because the deployed version is working but GitHub doesn't have the latest code.",1184705,1,8124
"I didn't see any mapping done between tables, for example, the company-realtor relationship isn't shown 1-to-n.",1194578,1,8124
"The application has really come a long way from the previous submission. I believe most of the page routes follow an appropriate application flow. There are several of the dependencies that are evidently not implemented do to the following observations: (1) Users are able to assign him/herself a Real Estate Company that doesn't exist in the system. This assignment should only be made with existing companies to fulfill the requirement of mapping a realtor to a single company. This missing dependency also reflects in the creation of houses. Realtors are able to create houses that are not listed with the company that the realtor is associated with. This association should be automatically made according to the company assigned to the realtor. (2) Users can be both a hunter and a realtor at the same time and can switch back and forth. How do you differentiate between a users abilities? Probably the best option would be to only allow users to be either a house hunter or a realtor. That would eliminate some of the ambiguities is associations and some unnecessary profile fields like house hunters having a real estate company. (3) Inquiries are not associated with houses. This posses an issue with knowing what property the house hunter is requesting information about. Overall, there have been great advances in your application since the first submit. Continue implementing those dependencies so that the required associations can hold.  ",1180545,1,8124
"Nice work implementing image upload for houses. I found some functionalities missing: - After deleting a company, an error page shows up instead of a valid page, also sometimes the company does not get deleted - Company edit link goes to home page instead of edit form - Realtor can create a house even though (s)he has no company - Interest list page for hunter loads 'page does not exist'",1184254,1,8124
"Deletion of House by admin is failing. Privacy breach - As a user, I am able to see details of all other users. Only admin should be able to see details of other users. Overall very good effort. If the above issues weren't there, I would have given full points.",1184706,1,8124
New houses are not adding.,1184200,1,8124
I couldn't log in using the admin credentials. Rest worked fine for me. Couldn't add houses in my interest list as a House Hunter.,1194579,1,8124
"Success in edge case testing is determined by the association of the module, to self or with other modules. Many edge cases in this application are dependent on relationships between modules. For example, because houses are not properly associated with realtors or companies, reassigning a realtor's company appears to have no affect. Administrators are not able to delete users or companies, but  I would image it would not throw an error. There are cases that I tested that dealt specifically around the models. Example: user accounts can be created with the same email accounts as long as they are of different user types. This and other edge cases of it type proved successful. It would be great to have edge case information listed in the ReadMe to clarify how these cases were dealt with. Again, implementing the necessary dependencies between models will help to eliminate many of these edge case issues. ",1180546,1,8124
" Not handled (1) - No actual link created between companies and users as user just stores the company name as a string. Instead, saving the company_id for the user will create a relation between them as the company_id will act as a foreign key. That way edge case example (1) can be handled. Not handled (2) -  Realtor can edit/delete any house that (s)he created even if company changes. Handled. When a user is deleted, (s)he is automatically deleted from potential buyer list of house.   The README.md does not cover how the system handles edge cases. ",1184255,1,8124
Delete of company is not working. Deletion of a house is not working Admin should not be able to change/add to his role. I was able to make admin as a realtor. System should not allow that,1184707,1,8124
"If as a realtor, I am trying to update my profile where I only change my company to a random company ""ABC"", it is updating just fine which I believe should not be done because the company doesn't exist and is not even being added to the company list as a new company. Couldn't check any of the admin's functionality. Couldn't sign-up as a Realtor.",1194580,1,8124
"There are some really great controller tests included in this application. Most of the functions in each controller are tested to ensure that they are returning and routing to the appropriate pages. Unfortunately, there are no model tests implemented. Model tests should be written to test that the appropriate attributes and relationships of each model are implemented successfully. It will prove extremely helpful in the improved functionality of your application. Make your model tests look like the controller test and you will be doing great!  ",1180547,1,8124
Some tests present only for houses controller.,1184256,1,8124
Only auto-generated test cases present.,1184708,1,8124
I didn't find any testing done for model or controller. Nor anything was mentioned in the readme.,1194581,1,8124
The code looks comprehensive to a good extent with the usage of comments and clear naming. 1. Adding the not interested feature is a plus point. 2. The naming is done well with attention to the singular and plural nouns for models and controllers. 3. No problem with respect to the coding clarity. ,1194552,1,8078
handled perfectly well.,1195624,-1,8078
"The code is well written. It is neat and easily readable. The function calls are very well done. Also, there is no bad naming the project. Code very well follows the DRY approach.",1193907,-1,8078
the code written seems to follow nice,1195306,-1,8078
good coding practice used.,1187913,-1,8078
Commented code in view/controller files,1186226,-1,8078
There were commits with required changes for the second submission. Commits from all team members could be seen showing their contribution.,1194553,-1,8078
yaah frequent commits were done throughout the course of project.,1195625,-1,8078

"By looking at their github page, I could see they submitted their changes actively and also they continued submitting changes in round 2 as well.",1193908,-1,8078
The team has a very well documented history of commits.  The commit history seems to be well spaced over the entire period of the project development cycle. The team has commits in each of the submission periods and have kept on adding functionalities and updating documentation. The team could have updated their readme a little bit more and added information regarding all the functionalities being assigned to individual roles and how the user experience is set up. Also the team could have adde information on how to run tests in Readme.md file,1195307,1,8078
157 commits.,1187914,-1,8078
Mapping has been properly implemented.,1194554,-1,8078

No form validations,1188576,1,8078
real estate company-realtor relationship should be 1-to-n -  missing,1185367,1,8078
I think the system handles the 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships well. The relationships are clearly defined with no problems. ,1193909,-1,8078
The team has a well structured schema. The team have defined the relationships between the tables properly. the models have defined all the relations properly.  ,1195308,-1,8078
"company realtor relation should be 1-n but isn't. also realtor , house_hunter should belong to user.",1187915,1,8078
Models/Schemas do not have the relationships defined. Looks like manual table updation on actions which makes it difficult to maintain long term.,1186228,1,8078
"Yes, the team has rectified the errors from the earlier review and has implemented the needed changes. Additional functionalities like the 'not interested' feature were also used.",1194555,-1,8078

Hunter - search doesn't work - can't make inquiries or add houses for interest list -",1189819,1,8078
The authors did a good job in developing the system. The system is working as it is supposed to work.,1193910,-1,8078
 the web application seems to have implemented all the functionalities properly. The team have updated the repository and implemented new features after the initial submission.,1195309,-1,8078
Addressed comment from 1st review.  ,1186229,-1,8078
"When admin deletes a company associated with a realtor, it gets reflected in the realtors profile. His company name shows nothing and the houses listed were also deleted. Admin is not able to view house hunters profile (error in deployment), but can view the same using Users section. When a user is deleted by admin, his inquiries are removed and he is no more a potential buyer too. When realtor changes/ creates new company, his previous company houses are deleted. This is reflected in the admin table too. Realtor is not able to view houses listed by others.  Edge cases A company can be created without filling in the fields required. (Yes an empty row is displayed to the hunter when a company is created without any detail). But it displays the Company number (row number) while seeing the houses. So a house is shown for a company that doesnt exist in the View companies page. Session control : When user signs out from a page and then goes back, the profile page should not be shown (as he is signed out). This should be considered.",1194556,1,8078
Edge cases are not handled,1188578,-1,8078
" 1. when a real estate company is deleted, then the house associated are also deleted 2. when i switch companies, the previous houses listed from that company, don't appear again. 3. cant make inquiries  ",1189820,1,8078
"1) If the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses, it would not delete the record, because a dependent realtor exists.   2) The realtor can change his real estate company and he won't be prohibited from removing houses.   3) If admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries, the inquiries will be deleted and house hunter will be removed from the buyers' list.",1193911,1,8078
"the following edge cases seem to have been handled and documented: 1.)On deleting a user, the corresponding househunter and realtor accounts are deleted.2.)On deleting a company, corresponding houses are deleted and realtors with that company have their company set to null3.)on deleting a househunter or house, the corresponding entry in interest list is deleted.4.)On deleting househunter or house, corresponding inquiry is deleted",1195310,-1,8078
works great. have mentioned in readme as well.,1187917,-1,8078
error w/o company for realtor on viewing buyers empty companies- validation missing for empty info on companies admin view - realtor show not working admin view - hunter show not working Search by area missing- no fields to search by area,1186230,1,8078
The above case is covered.,1194557,-1,8078
no test cases performed.,1195629,-1,8078
"tested multiple controllers, but i don't see any models being tested.",1189821,-1,8078
"Yes, the team has done pretty well in testing at least one model and one controller.",1193912,-1,8078
The team have implemented basic testing for basic CRUD functionalities for all the controllers and models. These look like the automatically generated tests from scaffold in rails.,1195311,-1,8078
couldn't find rspec file or any other test file.,1187918,-1,8078
1) The houses controller handles multiple users. It would make more sense to call methods to handle the case of each type of user. 3) The houses controller also has several long methods. These should be broken up into method calls.,1188972,1,8025
Code follows most of the ruby good practices.,1187857,-1,8025
The team seems to have followed proper naming conventions for naming all the classes as well as all the attributes. The  team seems to have written a clean and readable code.,1195155,-1,8025
The code quality is well written. Many of the functions are doing only one thing at a time. The only limitation I could observe is lack of comments in controller as well model. ,1195783,1,8025
The team committed throughout the project and during round 2.,1188973,-1,8025
There are quite a lot of commits meaning that the team could have grouped some of the changes together into one commit instead of commiting every small modification to make them more meaningful,1194917,1,8025
they have 181 commits,1180441,-1,8025
The team has a good history of commits and as can be seen from the github repository the trail of commits is well documented and each new feature added or bug fixed has a documented commit. The team kept pushing commits throughout both the deadlines and were regular.,1195156,-1,8025
Yes: a total of 181 comments and are continuously committed on the repo. ,1195784,-1,8025
"The database design is solid, with join tables for the n-n relationships.",1188974,-1,8025
The rb files set the has_many and belongs_to relationships correctly,1194918,-1,8025
"DB design is kind of ok, but there are redundant tables for roles/realtors/hunters/admins and users. I believe all this can be combined into one using proper fields and access control. This would have helped you guys keep the code easier as well. Everything else has been handled properly.",1187859,1,8025
The team has a well designed schema and has defined all the relationships between the tables properly.,1195157,-1,8025
"I can't create a house with no basement as a realtor. It also deleted my image after I uploaded it in this case, before it redirected me to the new page with error information. Also, potential buyers are listed twice (I'm assuming because they liked the house and submitted an inquiry to the realtor associated with it.).  ",1188975,1,8025
The app has the functionalities but the user display is available to all users even though that functionality has to be exclusive to the admin of the app. The realtor also has no means to add a new company and there is no way to edit the user's profile,1194919,1,8025
1 > No Option to switch roles between hunter/Realtor 2 > No default admin/realtor/hunter account. Maybe you forgot to run db:seed on the server 3 > No validation for Email while creating a company. Any string can be typed in. 4 > Inquiries can only have 1 reply which is a field in DB which gets updated,1187860,1,8025
"As a realtor, i tried to list a house with no basement, but it won't let me save it saying that an error is prohibiting me. It says basement is blank, when i clearly am selecting the no option. when i changed it to yes, it saved fine   As an admin I can't see potential buyer list for houses  ",1180443,1,8025
The system is well designed and all the features have been correctly added and all the functionalities work. The authors have fixed all the problems from the previous submission.,1195158,-1,8025
"The system works as it is supposed to. For example the realtor, the admin and the user can login and perform the related functionalities successfully. ",1195786,-1,8025
The system was very strong through edge cases and the README.md was very detailed.,1188976,-1,8025
 The realtor cannot choose company so the edge case that handle change in company is not handled,1194920,1,8025
"1 > Admin login is not working for me 2 > Since I cannot use Admin Account, i cannot test edge cases related to creating/deleting users or creating/deleting Companies 3 > Search is working but is case sensitive.",1187861,1,8025
"1) i deleted a company that a realtor was assigned to and it was deleted successfully but the house listed by that company is still in the house list 2) When i switched company for a realtor, i could still deleted the house i listed when i was a previous company 3) when a househunter who made inquiries was deleted, it got rid of their inquires from the system",1180444,1,8025
the first edge case wherein a comp[any is being deleted by the admin is handled perfectly and the associated listings and inquiries are deleted accordingly. The house hunter deletion is also handled perfectly so that their inquiry are deleted accordingly. Also the README.md  explains the working and the functionalities of each role properly.,1195159,-1,8025
"(1) What will happen if the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses? It deletes it successfully.     (2) What will happen if a realtor changes his/her real estate company? Will (s)he be prohibited to remove the houses (s)he listed in the previous company? No, houses are easily changed and can be deleted by realtors.    (3) What will happen if admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries? Will the inquiries be automatically deleted? If this house hunter is a potential buyer of a house, will (s)he be removed from the corresponding potential buyers list?  It cannot be removed if inquiries are pending.    4) You can come up with more edge-cases. If the system fails in some edge-cases, explain with enough details Most of the functionalities I checked, such as creating a house, putting inquiries, removing various users, looking back in different accounts if it removes such as inquiries if user has still submitted or pending inquiries. All works fine. ",1195787,-1,8025
The tests looked good.,1188977,-1,8025
The team has tested the app using RSpec and thoroughly tests the user module,1194921,-1,8025
Good job on testing everything with rspec. Tests look concise and crisp.,1187862,-1,8025
The team has implemented rspec testing and have thoroughly tested one model namely the users model with this. Also the team has used minitest to thoroughly test the users controller.,1195160,-1,8025
Test has been written for most of the functionalities and works well. The test folder has the relevant files with well commented code. ,1195788,-1,8025
All functionality seems to be there now.,1186205,-1,8108
All deletion cases are taken care of. ,1186206,-1,8108
Tests are good.,1186207,-1,8108
Yes Most of the issues identified are fixed 1) Admin not able to delete user accounts,1189569,1,8108
Controller Method Testing is incomplete,1189571,-1,8108
Code looks very clean. I did find some commented lines of code though.,1195720,1,8108
There were 26 commits in total. The team pushed some commits for the round 2.,1195721,-1,8108
Did not find such a relationship in the model. Did not find foreign key constraints as well.,1195722,-1,8108
"The Functionality is working just fine. I noticed one small problem though. As a house hunter, when I added a house to my interest list and then click on more, it says that the page that I was looking for does not exist.",1195723,1,8108
"I wasn't able to login as admin using the credentials given in the README file. Still, Edge cases are handled well.",1195724,1,8108
I found RSpec tests written for inquiry and users,1195725,-1,8108
"1. Switch role functionality could have been simplified. While logging there are two fields regarding roles. If a user forgets to mark yes for realtor, then switch role will be redundant. There is dependency between switch role and these fields. Both do the same functionality which results in code duplication. 2. A realtor should not be able to add inquiry, he should be able to reply to inquiry.",1186281,1,8108
1. All realtors belonging to a company should not be allowed to delete the company. Instead only the realtor who created the company must be allowed to delete. Else it can be catastrophic.,1186285,1,8108
"1. The team has tested parts of different models and controllers partially, but none of the models/controllers is thoroughly tested for complete functional verification.",1186286,-1,8108

"Yes, by looking at their commit history, the team still commit changes in round 2.       ",1180457,-1,8108
"By looking at their model file, they handle the relationship pretty well.       ",1180458,-1,8108
"Cannot upload the image to the house. And a realtor can create an inquiry which they should not. Also, the realtor should able to see the potential buyer for the house under their company, not only the house they create. The more button in the interest list does not work.       ",1180459,1,8108
" If delete a company, the realtor needs to find another company, and the house under this company disappeared. But the README.md does not cover the edge cases.       ",1180460,1,8108
"It tests the login function in the user controller, but not test any models.       ",1180461,1,8108
"I am not sure how to create a house hunter and realtor using the same email. I see a link to switch roles, but can only see realtor option there as it didn't allow me to create an account for house hunter with same details.",1185606,1,8108
"Realtor is unable to create his own company. I tried creating one, it dodn't give me an error but didn't even show the company in this list.",1185607,1,8108
"No bad naming, multiple calls for multiple tasks",1190390,-1,8108
Submitted changes throughout the project. Made commits in round 2.,1190391,-1,8108

"Code is written properly. One method is covering only one functionality. Also for more features, team has created new controllers. Hence I can conclude code is neat and readable.   ",1189178,-1,8062
Looks good. There are some files which are misleading like Realtors folder has edit_company file which is blank. Also the readme.md file is missing the Admin Login Details.,1189273,1,8062
"Overall, code is clean and readable. Naming and project structure is consistent with good practices. One issue that stood throughout the code is that authorization is done directly in controller methods. It would be better if this common functionality was moved to a separate function call (e.g. validating user's role in houses_controller#create method)",1184338,1,8062
The code is clean.,1195091,-1,8062

"Yes, changes we committed in round 2. Code commit could have better by committing as soon as possible. Committing few files and writing proper comments and description for the commit was missing.

The team has not written any test cases for the entities. There are only the default test cases.,1188666,1,8083
"Well written and able to follow. However, I see no branches created (and hence pull requests merged). All work is pushed direct to master.",1180337,1,8106
seems alright.,1189321,-1,8106
All methods and classes are well designed and serve well defined functionality. Good job! Could have named the methods and variables a little better. Each function performs a single task. Every method is short and to the point i.e does not contain many nested blocks or if.,1195824,1,8106

"Project name could have been better. Methods were kept small. Comments were left out in some controllers/views. If-else blocks weren't properly indented in some cases. Hard-coded numbers were used for comparisons. A better way is to create enums representing different values(such as roles) and using those enums in code. This way, something like if role == 2 becomes if role == REALTOR and thus is more clear.  ",1194067,1,8106
Good code writing. ,1196760,-1,8106
Good coding practices have been followed. Methods are crisp and single responsibility paradigm has been implemented.,1192497,-1,8106
Submitted well within deadline!,1180338,-1,8106
yes they did.,1189322,-1,8106
The team was regular in committing changes. The team continued to work in round 2 and made regular progress. All members contributed significantly. Great job! Could have started the project a bit earlier.,1195825,-1,8106
The team committed their changes throughout the project period consistently.,1183170,-1,8106
"Yes, the team has committed code changes in round2 ",1194688,-1,8106

"All dependencies are well modeled and designed. Every model has correctly associated relationships and validations. Your team is a pro! Realtor to house and house to company , other relationships are implemented.",1195826,-1,8106
Yes the relationships are handled properly 1 company multiple realtors etc. No mapping table as such the schema handles it,1191509,1,8106
"Realtor- house- inquiry relationship deleting realtors shouldn't delete houses and inquires. Interests shouldn't have been defined on the User model. Company has_many users-> Hunter doesn't belong to company. With such a relationship was, hunters could be associated to a company by editing request params before post request to create users.",1194069,1,8106
They missed some relation such as house and inquires 1-n relation.,1196762,1,8106
Relationship between user and company is vague. There is a separate realtor_accounts table. So users seems to be house_hunters. And house hunter does not need to have a relationship with company.,1192499,1,8106
"I was able to post house without any data filled in form. House got created successfully. Likewise for company. Phone number validation missing in Sign Up. Sort by Sqft, Price and floors are failing (going to error page) Applying price range filter and clicking once is giving expected result. Clicking on it again is resetting the filter. Could try to retain the applied filter on the html select option. When I tried to view a non-existent house manually by changing URL (example https://calm-forest-11598.herokuapp.com/house_lists/1000), I got the default Ruby error screen (""The page you were looking for doesn't exist"").  Could do a redirect to browse page :) (https://calm-forest-11598.herokuapp.com/house_lists/)   Tried to update an old inquiry. got a new page that says ""Invalid Access"" as well as ""Inquiry was successfully updated""!",1180340,1,8106
min can still be greater than max in house filter,1189324,1,8106
I did not find any problems in the first phase testing. All basic functionalities work as expected. Bonus points for the UI. One of the best I have seen. The web application is intuitive and guides the user in performing any function. Great job!,1195827,-1,8106
Most of the functionalities are implemented but I am not able to login as an admin using username password combination mentioned in readme. ,1183172,1,8106
Yes most of the required features are working fine. Some errors are there like Admin is able to add interest to houses which is an unintended feature as admin should change role before doing that.,1191510,1,8106
First reviews comments were fixed.  ,1194070,-1,8106
They still have the problem I found in the first round.,1196763,1,8106

"When the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses, all the houses and realtors are deleted as well. This is the expected functionality. Good job! All other test cases work as well. If a house hunter is deleted all of his/her inquiries are also deleted.",1195828,0,8106
"I could not login as admin using username password combination provided in readme. So, edge-cases could not be tested.",1183173,1,8106
"The readme document clearly mentions the edge cases when a company is deleted, what happens to the houses and realtors.",1194691,-1,8106
Edge cases like real estate company deletion are handled as deletions which is basically not handling it. Could've done some case like transferring them to other user account or such.,1191511,1,8106
house search not working- able to keep fields like price blank during new house creation I was getting inquiry- invalid access on replying to an inquiry but it did save to the database.   high-low links in  houses table erroring for realtor admin was able to add to interest list admin able to reply to queries hunter shouldn't have contact method authentication not applied throughout the app- https://calm-forest-11598.herokuapp.com/companies/42 accessible without login,1194071,1,8106

not thoroughly test. Not enough test written for inquiries,1189326,1,8106
Models and controllers are well tested. All edge cases are covered and tests are comprehensive. The inquiries controller is especially well tested. All assert statements are well thought of. ,1195829,-1,8106
Yes. the team has thoroughly tested.,1183174,-1,8106
The test only validates cases with valid attributes,1194692,1,8106
Most common cases are tested in controllers. They are using fixtures for testing ,1191512,-1,8106
"Yes, they used Rspect to test the code.",1196765,-1,8106
"Yes, they have tested a controller but not the model.",1192502,1,8106
The code looks clean and neat. Couldn't find any bad naming in the project.,1192312,-1,8117

"Naming convention followed, Code is neat. Formatting is done. Function calls are included.",1195225,-1,8117
The code was committed throughout the project. The code was committed in the second round too.,1192313,-1,8117
Team continuously pushing changes into github. I could not see distribution of work done equally. I could see 46 commits with a neat and easy to understand README file.,1190953,-1,8117
Yes,1195633,-1,8117
"Yes, the team has shown proper team collaboration, two members of the team kept submitting the changes throughout the projects. And there are sufficient commits for round 2.  ",1186755,-1,8117
Code is written properly with all DRY principles. Methods are simple and clean. Every method contains functions specific functionalities. MVC are created where they are needed.  ,1190952,-1,8117
DB relations are handled properly but dependent destroy is not mentioned because which there are issues when destroying entries which have a foreign key dependency.,1192314,1,8117
"Team has tried very well to associate relationship between models. It can be seen implemented, But thats also causing system crash when conditions not met. ",1190954,1,8117
"Yes, model and relationships are well designed and cover most of them. ",1195634,-1,8117
"Foreign key integration is been done in DB, but as there are no separate active records for user types(hunter, realtor,admin) hence the 1-1,1-Many etc relations are absent. ",1186756,1,8117
Destroy not working Unable to create user from admin,1188545,1,8117
"Inquiry part seems to be a bit confusing. The reply messages showed on the page is confusing. Displaying the message that ""error is occurring on Heroku but email has been sent doesn't look good.""",1192315,1,8117
Team has tried very well to fix the problems from first release and succeeded partially. Errors and form validations are still not specific. Below are few basic functionalities team could work upon. 1. House hunter is able to create and edit company as well as houses. 2. Admin can create users but no passwords.  ,1190955,1,8117
"1) logged in as a house hunter, I can edit a house, which should not be allowed. 2) logged in as a house hunter, I can edit the company, which should not be allowed. 3) Founded: 19677689 ----- the company year can be any numeric value 4) logged in as a house hunter, I can destroy house, which should not be allowed 5) logged in as a house hunter, I can destroy company, which should not be the case 6) Year built: 2001890 ---------- this field in house table for year takes any numerical value",1189498,1,8117
"Search for houses is missing  While submitting inquiry, the system errors out but that has been documented. This was also pointed out in earlier review  ",1195635,1,8117
UI for new house needs improvement. Forms need to be more precise rather than adding many radio buttons as in the case for 'New House'. UI for Inquiry/Reply needs to be more clear. ,1195228,1,8117
"Admin 1. Admin can not see all the inquiries by house hunters. Hunter 1.House search feature -Not implemented. 2.House Interest /interest list feature -Not implemented.  3.

"Team has tried well to cover up edge functionalities but still can work on below measures: 1. if we try to delete an entity associated with other entity, system crashes. 2. I can not see company field associated with realtor while creating a realtor. 3. Inquiry functionality is difficult to understand. As mentioned in Readme it does go into error, but i did not receive any mail for it. Also I can not see inquiry associated with house. 4. We can upload image but image is visible as activerecord id and not as image when viewing the house.     Potential buyer functionality not working.     Search house functionality not working.  ",1190956,1,8117

Readme does not talk about edge cases but it covers how to to access the website. Good thing is that most of the errors pointed out in the prior review have been taken care of.  Search is missing     ,1195636,-1,8117
"1.Admin can only delete a company which has no users(realtors/hunters), else he is unable to delete it. 2.Realtor cannot change his company and can post an ad under any user. 3. House hunter inquiry feature is absent hence could not test this test case.    ",1186758,1,8117
Test cases present for user controller.,1192317,-1,8117
Test Cases are written very well and system is tested well till some extend but many small cases needs to still handled.,1190957,1,8117
Integration tests don't cover authentication,1195637,1,8117
Basic functional test cases are written for four controllers. ,1186759,-1,8117

"The code is clean and easy to follow and each method handles one task. I could not understand the reason for some of the code, like the home action in the hunters_controller - the current user's role is set to 3 without any checks. So if the url is visited directly and user's role is something else, it will be set to 3 and saved, which can result in wrong behaviours. Overall code is well written/",1184322,1,8039
Yes. The team kept pushing commits through out the duration of the project. The team even kept pushing commits during round 2. Also all team mates seemed to have contributed equally.,1189195,-1,8039
"The team has been using github for almost entire tenure of the project. Yes, the team has made multiple changes during the round 2. The team has been making changes after the code submission as well till today's date.  ",1194277,1,8039
The team was regular in committing changes. The team continued to work in round 2 and made regular progress. All members contributed significantly. Great job! Could have started the project a bit earlier.,1195693,-1,8039

"Yes, the team has handled all the single and multiple associations among all entities quite well. All the relationships can be reviewed under the model of all the entities.  ",1194278,-1,8039
Yes. Models are maintained properly.,1195418,-1,8039
Database was well designed so as to avoid redundancy.,1192401,-1,8039
Looks good. All types of relationships are handled properly.,1184060,-1,8039
Yes. The mapping of 1 to n for company-realtor and company-houses is correctly done.,1194570,-1,8039
The design is well implemented. Relationships are well defined in models and edge cases are handled in schema itself. ,1184324,-1,8039

"The code quality is fairly standard, the code practices DRY principles fairly well. I would suggest creating new controllers for managing house hunters and realtors from admin profile since, on creating a new realtor/house hunter the admin logs out and this seems like stop gap fix. ",1185920,1,8066

"The code quality is fairly standard, the code practices DRY principles fairly well. I would suggest creating new controllers for managing house hunters and realtors from admin profile since, on creating a new realtor/house hunter the admin logs out and this seems like stop gap fix. ",1185920,1,8104
Some files like comment.rb don't suggest what they are used for,1191744,1,8104
"The code contains comments which makes it little hard to read through.Other than that the organisational way, refactoring methods are handled good",1194711,1,8104
The code on Github is clean and readable. The controller actions are specific and do only the tasks that are required. The naming convention used is also intuitive. The interest list functionality has not been implemented.,1189487,1,8104
The code is quite clearly written with all the good coding practices being followed.,1194751,-1,8104
"Yes, team kept on submitting their changes throughout the project. Only Readme.md file was updated in round 2.",1195759,1,8104

"Yes, 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships are handled correctly. Tables are mapped correctly.",1195760,-1,8104
Most of the mappings are done correctly.,1196492,-1,8104
"The relationships have been set up properly in the model files as well as the schema. However, a destroy dependency in the model file would be a great addition;  has_many :enquiries, dependent::destroy",1185922,1,8104
The dependencies are not handled properly. It errors out when we try to delete parent record like company or house . Use of Dependent destroy and proper mentioning on belongs to and has many relationship in all models should solve this issue,1191746,1,8104
The code on Github shows the 1 to n relationship between real estate company and realtor. The realtor is also able to create real estate companies of his own.,1189489,-1,8104
"Yes, the mapping is done quite well.",1194753,-1,8104
The system works as expected and common functionality is working but still needs to focus on some areas: 1. Not able to sign in as admin with preconfigured account. 2. how to add inquiries or to an interest list.,1195761,1,8104
"Signup functionality was not working. I could not log in from the admin role and house hunter role provided. After logging in from realtor's account, the link to inquiries failed(was broken).  ",1196493,1,8104
"The type of user in the view user panel through admin login is unavailable, would it be possible for the team to have two separate views/controllers and CRUD functions on realtors and hunters?",1185923,1,8104
Unable to delete users from admin Why can the admin edit password of the users ?  ,1188561,1,8104
"There are still session variables and route names being displayed on some of the screens which were suggested to be removed. The functionality is quite good considering there was no implementation during first review. Potential Buyers functionality is not implemented. Enquiry functionality doesn't work . It throws application error check logs error when clicked. Possibly a deployment issue. When  a new house is created , it is not displayed in the listings immediately. Admin login doesn't work. It may be possible that someone might have edited admin login during review or else please paste the latest login details in Readme.",1191747,1,8104
admin login fails: realtors and other users successful.  all functionalities works. ,1195948,1,8104
"Some of the functionalities are not fully implemented.  Admin login functionality is failing. The credentials given in the Readme file are probably wrong. Houses listed by realtors are not being displayed in the index page.  The edit, delete houses by realtor is not functional Realtors are unable to view inquiries and submit replies House hunters are unable to create interest lists and hence both interest list and potential buyers functionality is missing from the application.

"Clicking on ""List of inquiries"" broke the application.",1194754,1,8104
"As of now, I'm not able to sign in as admin with preconfigured account, I can't comment om test cases.  ",1195762,1,8104

Realtor can list a house without giving details of ",1196494,1,8104
"The admin is unable to destroy a real estate company due to the above mentioned dependency bug on the model files. Since all users are listed in a common view without information about who is a realtor and who is a house hunter, the admin would be unable to specifically test removing a type of user unless he/she creates one themselves. On changing real estate company through update for a realtor, the real estate company change was reflected else where, updation has been implemented well. The realtor is also unable to see the inquires or reply to them.",1185924,1,8104
"After creating the user from the admin , Why I am logged into the created user ?   Also, where can the user update the company info",1188562,1,8104
Deletion fails in most cases as dependent records don't get deleted. Model changes to add and delete these dependencies will resolve the issue.,1191748,1,8104
Edge cases are handled good and the readme is effective enough to understand the entire code flow.,1194715,-1,8104
"1. Unable to login as admin. Hence, I was not able to test the scenario when a real estate company is deleted by the admin. 2. The list listing link shows only the 2 pre-existing houses by default. Even after applying the appropriate search filters, the newly created houses are not being displayed. Hence, I was unable to test scenario of change of real estate company.  3. Since the admin login is not working, the test on inquiries could not be performed.",1189491,1,8104
could not log in as admin. Rest worked as expected.,1194755,1,8104
"The model test just tested the email attribute of the real estate company and the controller test mainly tested for successful responses and redirects, and not page content and method calls.",1195214,1,8023
"This team claimed to have fully tested the RealEstateCompany Model and Controller, but there were no tests in the RealEstateModel tests. I didn't check every file after since I don't like being lied to :)",1184567,1,8023
last moment commits.,1184221,1,8023
The testing was done,1193675,-1,8023
The system has been fully deployed and tests for the models and controllers are performed for the users involved in the system. The team checked for the edge case wherein the admin deleted the real estate company.,1190687,-1,8023
"Some methods were long and there was a lot of commented-out code. There was at least one instance of bad indentation. Otherwise, the methods were overall fairly short and the naming was sensible.",1195209,1,8023
"The code quality in this application looks good. I didn't see any extremely large methods, views were clean and simple, and controllers had one-to-one mappings with application-level functions.  I do think I would encourage this team to consider using scopes in their models next time as I did not see many here.",1184562,1,8023
"The code is clear and simple, most functions have seperate method calls.",1193670,-1,8023
The code followed the basic practices for clean and effective programming using Ruby and Rails. The methods and function calls were efficient in that they only performed the task it was assigned to do.,1190682,-1,8023
They started adding more commits after the first round of reviews.,1184563,1,8023
The team kept committing their changes even in round 2.,1193671,1,8023
A major portion of the project was completed in the first stage itself. Certain noticeable changes that the team implemented in this stage included setting up admin functionalities to view and destroy the realtor or househunter accounts.,1190683,-1,8023
The models had the correct relationships. The database seemed to have missed some of these. There was not table for potential buyers (n-to-n house-hunter relationship).,1195211,1,8023
I think this team nailed the entity relationships with this application. Everything had the right relationships.,1184564,-1,8023
The relationships between various entities is clear.,1193672,-1,8023
The relationships of realtor to real estate company or realtor to house hunter justified proper mapping between them. The system handled the 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships properly.,1190684,-1,8023
"Overall this was a usable system. However, This app did not do a good job of keeping track of my session. Once I edited that admin account, I could not navigate via links to the home page and was also asked to sign-in again if I clicked ""admin sign-in"". Even if I signed up as a different user, my admin account was still signed into. I also was not logged-in upon signing-up as a Realtor or House-Hunter.   Some other comments are:  An Admin should be able to set the password for realtor or house-hunter. That is a security vulnerability.  When I tried to use the ""Reset password link"", I get an error. When creating a house as an Admin, I shouldn't have to know the ID of the company, I should be provided a drop-down of existing companies - the same way for how a realtor chooses a company to join. Asking a realtor to choose or create a company before signing up is another security vulnerability - you leak the existing companies and allow someone who isn't a user of your system to create a company. The Inquiry and Interest flow in this application is really well done.    ",1184565,1,8023
"As a house hunter I could edit houses. Also, anyone can create a company, and a realtor cannot create a company before signing up. A realtor could not submit a reply to an inquiry. A realtor could not drop his or her company and could list a house without choosing a company. Last, table IDs are all over the site which is confusing and not helpful to the user. These IDs should not appear to the user or have to be used to create new entities.",1195212,1,8023
The search button in not there. No way to add new house. Realtor is given some destroy privileges which are not meant for him. ,1184219,1,8023
The basic functionalities in the system are working properly ,1193673,-1,8023
The user interface of the system helps to understand the general flow of the program. It also supports sessions and enables user to navigate based on their tasks.,1190685,-1,8023
3) The admin encountered an exception when trying to view potential buyers of a house after its only potential buyer was deleted.   The README.md did not describe how the system handles edge cases.,1195213,1,8023
Here a few things I found:  I could list a house that was built in the future. I was also required to give a full date instead of just a year. I was able to edit a house as a House Hunter ,1184566,1,8023
"The Readme file does not specify any information about how edge cases are handled but the edge cases were properly handled. when the real estate company was deleted all the houses and realtors under it were also deleted. However the role switch option between realtor and househunter is not available, further this operation cannot be performed manually also as the code resticts a mail id from being used for two accounts.",1193674,1,8023
"Upon testing the system for edge cases, the following results were obtained : 1. The real estate company is destroyed and the realtors houses and houses inquiries for the same are removed. 2. The realtor can switch to another company. They will be prohibited to remove the houses listed in the previous company though. 3. The house hunter accounts are deleted without their inquiries . 4. The System does not check for regex fr phone number input during signup.",1190686,1,8023
"Admin cannot delete users Deleting a House Hunter crashes the app No validation present in any models, eg Houses/Real Estate Company   Admin cannot delete houses",1180486,1,8039
"The README.md does not cover how the system handles edge cases. What will happen if the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses?: System deletes the Realestate company but the app crashes when accessing the realtor account. What will happen if a realtor changes his/her real estate company? Will (s)he be prohibited to remove the houses (s)he listed in the previous company? There is no validation at all, and there is no way to have a realtor without a company. If this house hunter is a potential buyer of a house, will (s)he be removed from the corresponding potential buyers list: app crashes ",1180487,1,8039
Only basic controller tests have been provided,1180488,1,8039
"Code in the model methods looks very clean. Attribute symbols are appropriately validated and proper constraints are applied to measure uniqueness. The controller code has great parenthesis and bracket use for function calls and assignments. More consistent spacing of functions and function content would aid in the readability of the code. Also, there are a few instances where conditional blocks are empty. If there is no purpose for the block, it should be removed (example found in the static page controller). Overall, the code seems to implement good Ruby style standards.  ",1182492,1,8072
"The code is readable and easy to understand, but at the same time it is not effectively modularized.There are seveal methods which perform the functions of other methods too, which could have better been modularised Apart from that, ",1188882,1,8072
"Most of the code is auto-generated from rails generator so they do the generic thing. Although they have connected most of the app, the basic functionalities are still lacking and no new code has been written. The only part I see is the sessions controller that has been written manually, and follows correct coding convention.",1187833,1,8072
"1. Yes, that is taken care of. 2. No bad naming 3. Questionable redirection. ",1187881,-1,8072
"The repository name isn't what it is supposed to be. Naming seems inappropriate. plus, there is no read me file explaining the flow of webapp.",1185627,1,8072
Code quality looks good. Standard conventions have been used. It is also good to see that the team has used seeds.rb for data generation.   ,1185207,-1,8072
some direction code is ambiguous,1185960,1,8072
There are no issues with code quality or naming. Code is clean and readable and follows Ruby on Rails practices.  Most methods are short and do one specific task. One possible improvement would be moving out authorization functionality from controller methods to separate functions.,1186951,1,8072
Group continued to revise and commit changes for the project throughout round two. Commits were clearly stated as to the purpose. You can see the development process of the project through the changes applied.,1182493,-1,8072
"The commits were not scattered throughout the development cycle, rather they were concentrated on a particular couple of days, which indicate that the project was a last minute rush, rather than a pre-planned and well executed one. ",1188883,1,8072
"Very Few commits in the project, with most commits coming just from one user towards the deadline period. A lot of Commits done after the deadline period",1187834,1,8072
The team did not commit their changes throughout the project period. The changes were committed in round 2.,1187850,1,8072
"Yes, 22 commits in total and they have consistently kept on working on Git throughout.",1187882,-1,8072
"No, majority checkins are near deadlines and not well spread out. Usage of multiple branch is good. ",1185208,1,8072
"The team has pushed almost all the commits on 2-3 days of the entire cycle, not regular. Also, the commits are made by one person, which seems strange to me.",1196687,1,8072
"Most commits were done by one person which cannot be considered a good practice. Naming of commits is done well, names are descriptive of the introduced changes. I would suggest doing commits more often by dividing work into smaller chunks.",1186952,1,8072
"It seems that some of the associations were attempted. (1) Real Estate Company contains many users and houses and (2) House belongs to a Real Estate Company and a user. These relationships are currently commented out so the dependencies are not enforced. There are additional connections missing such as the Users model, where a Realtor should belong to only a single company and many houses. The implementation seems incomplete, but the idea found within the company and house models is moving in the right direction.",1182494,1,8072
The relationship mapping was appropriate and worked as intended. The database unfortunately didn't implement all the necessary features required for the submission. (For example: list of potential buyers),1188884,1,8072
"All the 1-n, n-n Relationships have been commented out. There are no mapping table in Schema as well.",1187835,1,8072
"To the most extent of it. Since, the profile of admin is problematic and not allowing us to login at all. That area is unavailable for testing. ",1187883,1,8072
"As of now, all relationships have been commented out, I am not sure why this has been done.  ",1185209,1,8072
Following are some of the relationships missing:   house hunter has_many inquiries realtor has_one company,1196688,1,8072
"1-to-n and n-to-n relationships are handled correctly. The system utilizes foreign key columns in the database to achieve this. For example, 1-to-n relationship between realtor and real estate company is achieved by adding a company_id field to user table. Same utilized by houses table which are linked to one realtor and one company.",1186953,-1,8072
can not log in as admin,1185962,1,8072
"Your home page is very clear as to the application purpose. Unfortunately, I am unable to sign up as a new user or login with any of the pre-configured user accounts included in the Readme. I can, however, attempt to sign up and/or login but this information is never saved to the database for future access or the appropriate transitioning is not implemented. I like that there are two options listed on the homepage to either sign up as a new user or to login in as a current user. This is convenient for navigation. Consider spacing these links for easier identification. I would also point out that the options in the drop down box included for selecting user type during sign up is a great idea. The third option, is a ambiguous as to its purpose. What does it mean to sign up as a realtor who is also shopping for a house? Perhaps you can just limit the options to Realtor or House Hunter. The functionality of searching homes should be included in the Realtor services. Keep up the work. Once the database is successfully receiving user details and/or the appropriate routes are assigned, additional functionalities should be easy to implement.",1182495,1,8072
"There are a lot of functional bugs. Also, lots of required functionalities like listing a house as interested, list of potential buyers etc are missing. Also, there are a lot of navigational bugs.

There are many additional functions of the sessions controller that should be tested including create, destroy, successful log in, etc. Making sure that each of these methods are functional will aid in the development of further successful application flows.

I really appreciate the organization of your code. Everything is grouped in appropriate folders and easy to navigate. I also like how most of your code is indexed and spaced. Great readability. Functions are clearly written to handle exactly what the name indicates.

They can even edit the deleted company from their profile and list a house on behalf of the deleted company. When a realtor edits and updates his company after it is deleted, it actually gets created again. When a realtor changes his company, he can view only the houses of his current company and is prohibited to delete houses of his previous company. This works as expected.

So, it means the company is not being deleted, even when it says so on the admin page. (2): the realtor isn't able to view any houses except his own company. (3): No, the inquiries are not auto deleted, nor is the househunter removed from potential buyers list.",1188657,1,8100

There seems to be a rudimentary test they have implemented as gathered by going through their file 'application_system_test'. This and the test file in the models shows that they have taken sufficient efforts to thoroughly examine their code. ,1193928,-1,8100
None of the controller or model are tested.,1190829,1,8100

However, the arrangement of code is difficult to understand given that not all functionalities seem to have been implemented. The ""def after_sign_in_path_for"" function in the applications controller used by the devise gem, only takes realtor as a resource, I would advise using an if or case condition within the function to allow other users to login. Also, I was unable to find any implementation for making sure that only the inquiries specific to a real estate company be visible to a realtor, and similarly only the inquiries posted by a house hunter themselves be visible to the house hunter on that specific house. I would again suggest using some If or case statements in the show function of the inquiries controller to establish identity of current_user. ",1185912,-1,8030

"The code is clean and readable. Every method handles only one task. However there are two controllers for house hunters and realtors which I felt was redundant. These could have been merged and written in a single controller. There is no bad naming in the project, they have followed the naming conventions. There are no long methods. Methods have been written concisely and in a readable way.",1195185,1,8030
The team seems to have attempted to add to their functionality from the previous round. They have attempted to use the devise gem for allowing multiple user logins. It seems that they created a new git repo and started from the beginning which seems like a fair idea given that they wanted to use devise instead of implementing the user registration/sessions. ,1185913,-1,8030

From the Code DB Design looks fine. They have handled most of the relationships properly. Although I believe having different tables for admins/realtors/hunters/users/roles and role maps is un-necessary and just increases the complexity of the system. ,1187867,-1,8030

"I cannot access the link provided by the team. Since this is hosted on AWS, I believe they have not opened the Ip to public by mistake (I have worked with AWS before and this happens). Maybe they worked from Library or their house, and when you spawn an instance in AWS it adds the IP from where the instance is spawned to the access list, which is why I am not able to access this from my IP. This can also be a problem with the proxy server setup in the instance and since you guys are maybe doing ssh into the server to deploy your code, the default HTTP request will go to port 80 and wont be forwarded to 8080 unless explicitly specified in apache/nginx and will block the requests.

Though not major, a suggestion for the team is to avoid using pronouns or subjective references such as my_interest_list and houses_posted_by_me for method naming.

Test cases for the user have been implemented.,1196635,-1,8031
Still have lots of tests across all of the models and controllers but nothing super extensive that attempts to cover all possible cases.,1188571,-1,8031
The User model and controller has been tested. It does not test whether the system handles the case that a user uses the same email to register twice.  ,1184240,1,8031
The team has tested both a model and controller. The system can handle the following cases 1)when user uses same email to register twice.  2)should not save user with password less than 6 chars. 3)should not save user with invalid email 4)should not save user without email,1187013,-1,8031
"The user model is tested, as are multiple controllers.",1189167,-1,8031
They have written proper test cases that check both positives and negatives.,1195352,-1,8031
Good coding practices have been followed. Methods are crisp and single responsibility paradigm has been implemented.,1192497,-1,8109
Good code writing. ,1196760,-1,8109
"Project name could have been better. Methods were kept small. Comments were left out in some controllers/views. If-else blocks weren't properly indented in some cases. Hard-coded numbers were used for comparisons. A better way is to create enums representing different values(such as roles) and using those enums in code. This way, something like if role == 2 becomes if role == REALTOR and thus is more clear.  ",1194067,1,8109
"Code quality is good, linked features are working fine like the one asked in question.",1191507,-1,8109
"Yes, the code written was clean and readable",1183169,-1,8109
"Well written and able to follow. However, I see no branches created (and hence pull requests merged). All work is pushed direct to master.",1180337,-1,8109
seems alright.,1189321,-1,8109
All methods and classes are well designed and serve well defined functionality. Good job! Could have named the methods and variables a little better. Each function performs a single task. Every method is short and to the point i.e does not contain many nested blocks or if.,1195824,1,8109
Submitted well within deadline!,1180338,-1,8109
yes they did.,1189322,-1,8109
The team was regular in committing changes. The team continued to work in round 2 and made regular progress. All members contributed significantly. Great job! Could have started the project a bit earlier.,1195825,-1,8109
The team committed their changes throughout the project period consistently.,1183170,-1,8109
"Yes, the team has committed code changes in round2 ",1194688,-1,8109
"They added a few changes, could've listed more on Readme.",1191508,1,8109
"Yes, they still commited until yesterday.",1196761,-1,8109
"Yes, the team kept committing changes throughout the duration of the project.",1192498,-1,8109
"All dependencies are well modeled and designed. Every model has correctly associated relationships and validations. Your team is a pro! Realtor to house and house to company , other relationships are implemented.",1195826,-1,8109
Yes the relationships are handled properly 1 company multiple realtors etc. No mapping table as such the schema handles it,1191509,-1,8109
"Realtor- house- inquiry relationship deleting realtors shouldn't delete houses and inquires. Interests shouldn't have been defined on the User model. Company has_many users-> Hunter doesn't belong to company. With such a relationship was, hunters could be associated to a company by editing request params before post request to create users.",1194069,1,8109
They missed some relation such as house and inquires 1-n relation.,1196762,1,8109
Relationship between user and company is vague. There is a separate realtor_accounts table. So users seems to be house_hunters. And house hunter does not need to have a relationship with company.,1192499,1,8109
min can still be greater than max in house filter,1189324,1,8109
"I was able to post house without any data filled in form. House got created successfully. Likewise for company. Phone number validation missing in Sign Up. Sort by Sqft, Price and floors are failing (going to error page) Applying price range filter and clicking once is giving expected result. Clicking on it again is resetting the filter. Could try to retain the applied filter on the html select option. When I tried to view a non-existent house manually by changing URL (example https://calm-forest-11598.herokuapp.com/house_lists/1000), I got the default Ruby error screen (""The page you were looking for doesn't exist"").  Could do a redirect to browse page :) (https://calm-forest-11598.herokuapp.com/house_lists/)   Tried to update an old inquiry. got a new page that says ""Invalid Access"" as well as ""Inquiry was successfully updated""!",1180340,1,8109
I did not find any problems in the first phase testing. All basic functionalities work as expected. Bonus points for the UI. One of the best I have seen. The web application is intuitive and guides the user in performing any function. Great job!,1195827,-1,8109
Most of the functionalities are implemented but I am not able to login as an admin using username password combination mentioned in readme. ,1183172,1,8109
First reviews comments were fixed.  ,1194070,-1,8109
They still have the problem I found in the first round.,1196763,1,8109
Yes most of the required features are working fine. Some errors are there like Admin is able to add interest to houses which is an unintended feature as admin should change role before doing that.,1191510,1,8109
The issues reported are fixed.   Admin account can be deleted from the user listing.,1192500,1,8109
"Yes, they have tested a controller but not the model.",1192502,1,8109
"Yes, they used Rspect to test the code.",1196765,-1,8109
Most common cases are tested in controllers. They are using fixtures for testing ,1191512,-1,8109

"Able to create two users with same email. And if I try to login with that particular email, error screen appears.",1180342,1,8109
not thoroughly test. Not enough test written for inquiries,1189326,1,8109
Models and controllers are well tested. All edge cases are covered and tests are comprehensive. The inquiries controller is especially well tested. All assert statements are well thought of. ,1195829,-1,8109

1) The houses controller handles multiple users. It would make more sense to call methods to handle the case of each type of user. 3) The houses controller also has several long methods. These should be broken up into method calls.,1188972,1,8021
Code follows most of the ruby good practices.,1187857,-1,8021
The team seems to have followed proper naming conventions for naming all the classes as well as all the attributes. The  team seems to have written a clean and readable code.,1195155,-1,8021
The code quality is well written. Many of the functions are doing only one thing at a time. The only limitation I could observe is lack of comments in controller as well model. ,1195783,1,8021

There are quite a lot of commits meaning that the team could have grouped some of the changes together into one commit instead of commiting every small modification to make them more meaningful,1194917,-1,8021
they have 181 commits,1180441,-1,8021
The team has a good history of commits and as can be seen from the github repository the trail of commits is well documented and each new feature added or bug fixed has a documented commit. The team kept pushing commits throughout both the deadlines and were regular.,1195156,-1,8021
Yes: a total of 181 comments and are continuously committed on the repo. ,1195784,-1,8021
"The database design is solid, with join tables for the n-n relationships.",1188974,-1,8021
The rb files set the has_many and belongs_to relationships correctly,1194918,-1,8021
"DB design is kind of ok, but there are redundant tables for roles/realtors/hunters/admins and users. I believe all this can be combined into one using proper fields and access control. This would have helped you guys keep the code easier as well. Everything else has been handled properly.",1187859,1,8021
The team has a well designed schema and has defined all the relationships between the tables properly.,1195157,-1,8021
"I can't create a house with no basement as a realtor. It also deleted my image after I uploaded it in this case, before it redirected me to the new page with error information.

The app has the functionalities but the user display is available to all users even though that functionality has to be exclusive to the admin of the app. The realtor also has no means to add a new company and there is no way to edit the user's profile,1194919,1,8021

"The system works as it is supposed to. For example the realtor, the admin and the user can login and perform the related functionalities successfully. ",1195786,-1,8021
The system was very strong through edge cases and the README.md was very detailed.,1188976,-1,8021
 The realtor cannot choose company so the edge case that handle change in company is not handled,1194920,1,8021
"1 > Admin login is not working for me 2 > Since I cannot use Admin Account, i cannot test edge cases related to creating/deleting users or creating/deleting Companies 3 > Search is working but is case sensitive.",1187861,1,8021
"1) i deleted a company that a realtor was assigned to and it was deleted successfully but the house listed by that company is still in the house list 2) When i switched company for a realtor, i could still deleted the house i listed when i was a previous company 3) when a househunter who made inquiries was deleted, it got rid of their inquires from the system",1180444,1,8021
the first edge case wherein a comp[any is being deleted by the admin is handled perfectly and the associated listings and inquiries are deleted accordingly. The house hunter deletion is also handled perfectly so that their inquiry are deleted accordingly. Also the README.md  explains the working and the functionalities of each role properly.,1195159,-1,8021
"(1) What will happen if the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses? It deletes it successfully.     (2) What will happen if a realtor changes his/her real estate company? Will (s)he be prohibited to remove the houses (s)he listed in the previous company? No, houses are easily changed and can be deleted by realtors.    (3) What will happen if admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries? Will the inquiries be automatically deleted? If this house hunter is a potential buyer of a house, will (s)he be removed from the corresponding potential buyers list?  It cannot be removed if inquiries are pending.    4) You can come up with more edge-cases. If the system fails in some edge-cases, explain with enough details Most of the functionalities I checked, such as creating a house, putting inquiries, removing various users, looking back in different accounts if it removes such as inquiries if user has still submitted or pending inquiries. All works fine. ",1195787,1,8021
The tests looked good.,1188977,-1,8021
The team has tested the app using RSpec and thoroughly tests the user module,1194921,-1,8021
Good job on testing everything with rspec. Tests look concise and crisp.,1187862,-1,8021
The team has implemented rspec testing and have thoroughly tested one model namely the users model with this. Also the team has used minitest to thoroughly test the users controller.,1195160,-1,8021
Test has been written for most of the functionalities and works well. The test folder has the relevant files with well commented code. ,1195788,-1,8021
Code is well written. All the conventions of the rails framework have been followed. The functions have been properly defined and does only what it is supposed to do.,1195066,-1,8075
Code looks neat and clean.,1191523,-1,8075
"Code is written properly. Simple and clean Every function is simple and has distinguishing work. Did not understand the need of creating MVC for search, photos separately.  Many functionalities could have been merged together and made a defined solution. Eg house search function could have been added in House MVC.",1190303,1,8075
"In general, the code of this system is clean and readable, but there are some problems in it. For example, author didn't handle the interest list properly. When a realtor wants to see the potential buyers of a house, it does not mean he wants to see all the hunters registered in the system. Besides, the realtor can not edit his own profile can change real estate company, because the edit method in the controller is not realized. And in models, some relationships shouldn't appear because one of the model is not created, such as the model house_hunters, which has many queries, but the model query is not created. ",1195890,1,8075
"The code is well written. It is neat and easily readable. The function calls are very well done. Also, there is no bad naming the project. Code very well follows the DRY approach.",1193915,-1,8075
Code is clean and easy to understand. Some unused/unimplemented empty function definitions are there in the files.,1193504,-1,8075
functions are not named properly. example getphoto in photos_controller.,1187897,1,8075
The code follows the general guidelines for quality and concept of clean coding. The models and controller were designed with general practice approach using Ruby and Rails coding methodologies.,1186667,-1,8075
"Yes, the changes were committed throughout, but the commit messages could be a bit more descriptive.",1195067,1,8075
The code was committed throughout the project and code was committed in the second round too.,1191524,-1,8075
Yes. Team is continuously pushing changed on the github but not distributed equally among team mates. I could see 81 commits till now.,1190304,1,8075
"This team is keep on submitting their changes throughout the project, and not only one or two members of the team, but all of them are playing a role in this project. Besides, they did commit changes in round 2.",1195891,-1,8075
"By looking at their github page, I could see they submitted their changes actively and also they continued submitting changes in round 2 as well.",1193916,-1,8075
The team committed the changes in round 2 but overall the commits were not consistent.,1183204,1,8075
Yes they committed a lot of code after first review which can be due to the fact it wasn't deployed by review 1. But overall the number of commits is higher than average i believe,1193505,1,8075
yes about 83 commits.,1187898,-1,8075
The team improved upon certain aspects of their code. This included establishing the admin functions and actions as adding new companies and to view various participants involved.,1186668,-1,8075
"Relationships have not been properly defined in the models. For example, in the company.rb file, the relationships have been commented out. Also, in the case of house model, it had only been related to a realtor and not to a real estate company.",1195068,1,8075
Found that company has many users missing House has many inquiries and reply missing.,1191525,1,8075
"Team has tried implementing relation between model, but they does not seem to work well. deleting one branch of relation does not affect other branch though they are associated. ",1190305,1,8075
"Not really. First of all, as I was mentioned above, the relationship between house_hunter and query didn't handle properly. Second, a realtor should belong to a real estate company, not ""has one"", and the real estate company should has many realtors, and the mapping of two models does not work. The company id of realtors in realtors' list look like a set of random number, which has nothing to do with the table real estate company.",1195892,1,8075
I think the system handles the 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships well. The relationships are clearly defined with no problems.,1193917,-1,8075
Seeing from the schema file the logic seems fine but unable to test it out.,1193506,1,8075
there is only one relationship in the whole project. Not a good database design. Plus destroying one entity won't delete another as i can see from the code. Rest i am not able to test as i am not able to login other than admin. Not able to register as well.,1187899,1,8075
The code procedure and application justified the 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships between the realtor and house hunter model as well as real estate company and realtor relationship mapped as 1-to-n.,1186669,-1,8075
"No form validation in the create new company page. For example, when 'Founded' field is given as text and updated, it succeeds but the value is saved as a 0. Admin is unable to add new realtors. Throws up an error. Admin is unable to add new house hunters. Throws up an error. Not able to sign up as either a realtor or house hunter. Gives the ""something went wrong error"". Something is wrong with the deployment. Please look into it.  ",1195069,1,8075
Search functionality for houses not found. Asking for company id and realtor id which is difficult for the user to remember. A better would be to associate house based on a company name or add the house to the company associated with the realtor. Admin not able to add realtors. Admin not able add inquiries or reply to inquiries or add himself as a potential buyer. Unable to sign up as a hunter or realtor. Only admin is able to create the users.  ,1191526,1,8075
"1)In the first release there was a issue in user registration. The issue still persists. Team has kept both realtor and house hunter registration on the same page that only allows house hunter to register. 2)Can not register new realtor using registration link. For simpler design, team could have simply give 2 links for 2 types of user registration. 3)Team tried covering many functionalities as compared to last release and succeeded partially. 4)Team has provided admin credentials and admin functionalities are working fine.",1190306,1,8075
"They fix part of the problems showed in round 1. All kinds of user still cannot edit his own profile, even though admin can perform CRUD of hunters and realtors. And the realtor can not replace and create a new company. The hunter can not make inquires and realtor are not able to reply them. Besides, the search filter for the houses are not working. And when a realtor views the house's potential buyers, he/she will see all the hunters registered in the system.",1195893,1,8075
I think the authors did a good job in developing the system. The system is working as it is supposed to work.,1193918,-1,8075
"I am unable to signup so could not login and check for functionalities. But, UI is improved a lot and the confusing sign up page in round 1 is fixed.",1183206,1,8075
"Able to login with admin and use all functionalities . But unable to signup for realtor or househunter it shows the heroku page ""we're sorry something went wrong""",1193507,1,8075
not able to login other than admin. not able to register myself. edit option is not working when admin is trying to edit. inquires/respond to inquiry etc i am not able to test as i am not able to register myself. search not working on heroku but they have mentioned its working in local.,1187900,1,8075
"In the first round, the application was slightly performing better as compared to the final one. The team may have had troubles while merging and unresolved conflicts lead to error pages for signups.",1186670,1,8075
"1)Admin is able to delete the company which has houses and realtor associated with it. When you try to edit houses associated with such company, the add button does not perform any action. where in if you try to edit houses, houses get edited successfully. It seems like relation between model and tables is not maintained properly. 2) While creating new houses realtor is asked to enter id of company and realtor.   These id's are back end data with system incremented numbers and not given to user after       registration. Hence we should restrain displaying such back end information to users.  3) Not able to submit inquiry. Posting an inquiry and reply to the inquiry is on same page, visible to house hunter. 4)  With this release team has written README file very well and neatly. Also provided admin credentials.      Below are few major functionalities team can work upon:      a)House hunter can create new company.      b)Can not register as realtor.      c)Search functionality not working.      d)Potential buyer functionality not implemented properly. It does not connect houses with potentials           buyer. It seem like listing all the buyers.       ",1190307,1,8075
"Actually, all these edge cased list above are not realized at all.  And the mapping relationships between the models don't work at all. For example, when I delete a real estate company, and I look back to realtors' list, nothing happened, because the company id in the realtors' list looks like some random number, such as a company id 6, which is not appear in the company list. And so does the house list. ",1195894,1,8075
"1) If the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses, it would not delete the record, because a dependent realtor exists.   2) The realtor can change his real estate company and he won't be prohibited from removing houses.   3) If admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries, the inquiries will be deleted and house hunter will be removed from the buyers' list.",1193919,1,8075
Functionalities work fine but could not find inquiries form after logging as an admin.,1183207,1,8075
"Couldn't check the base cases, edge cases.  Also found high similarity of program2 doc that detailed the requirements with readme ",1193508,1,8075
not able to login other than admin. not able to register myself. edit option is not working when admin is trying to edit. inquires/respond to inquiry etc i am not able to test as i am not able to register myself. search not working on heroku but they have mentioned its working in local.,1187901,1,8075
The edge cases lead to following results : 1. It asks for confirmation before destroying the company. After that the company is deleted even for those with some realtors and houses. 2. Unable to test due to failure for realtor signup. 3. It asks for confirmation before destroying the house hunter account. Unable to test for inquiries due to failure for house hunter signup. 4. The system does not allow new realtor or house hunter to sign up for application.,1186671,1,8075
Models have not been tested. Controllers are partially tested.,1195071,1,8075
No test cases apart from default test cases.,1191528,1,8075
"Team has written test cases , but they need to few more rounds of testing, including positive test cases as well as negative test cases.",1190308,1,8075
"No, they did not write the test code.",1195895,1,8075
"Yes, I feel the team has done pretty well in testing at least one model and one controller.",1193920,-1,8075
"Some very basic testing is done for controllers, nothing in models",1193509,1,8075
"they have just tested signup. controller looks good, but model testing isn't complete.",1187902,1,8075
The team thoroughly tested the Admin model and controller. The tests for admin performed checks for admin functionality to be able to view the list of houses created by the realtors as well as look up for realtors and house hunters information that are involved in application.,1186672,-1,8075
"1. When the admin deletes a real estate company which has some realtors and houses, (s)he can no longer view the list of other realtors, house hunters and users. The view button redirects to an error page. 2. Admin was able to view realtors/hunters/ users before any deletion happened. After the above step 1, it seems taht admin is unable to view users, realtors and hunters. So, admin cannot delete any users, realtors and hunters.",1184239,1,8031
"Some methods were long and there was a lot of commented-out code. There was at least one instance of bad indentation. Otherwise, the methods were overall fairly short and the naming was sensible.",1195209,1,8047
The models had the correct relationships. The database seemed to have missed some of these. There was not table for potential buyers (n-to-n house-hunter relationship).,1195211,1,8047
"As a house hunter I could edit houses. Also, anyone can create a company, and a realtor cannot create a company before signing up. A realtor could not submit a reply to an inquiry. A realtor could not drop his or her company and could list a house without choosing a company. Last, table IDs are all over the site which is confusing and not helpful to the user. These IDs should not appear to the user or have to be used to create new entities.",1195212,1,8047
"Overall this was a usable system. However, This app did not do a good job of keeping track of my session. Once I edited that admin account, I could not navigate via links to the home page and was also asked to sign-in again if I clicked ""admin sign-in"". Even if I signed up as a different user, my admin account was still signed into. I also was not logged-in upon signing-up as a Realtor or House-Hunter.   Some other comments are:  An Admin should be able to set the password for realtor or house-hunter. That is a security vulnerability.  When I tried to use the ""Reset password link"", I get an error. When creating a house as an Admin, I shouldn't have to know the ID of the company, I should be provided a drop-down of existing companies - the same way for how a realtor chooses a company to join. Asking a realtor to choose or create a company before signing up is another security vulnerability - you leak the existing companies and allow someone who isn't a user of your system to create a company. The Inquiry and Interest flow in this application is really well done.    ",1184565,1,8047
The search button in not there. No way to add new house. Realtor is given some destroy privileges which are not meant for him. ,1184219,1,8047
3) The admin encountered an exception when trying to view potential buyers of a house after its only potential buyer was deleted.   The README.md did not describe how the system handles edge cases.,1195213,1,8047
Here a few things I found:  I could list a house that was built in the future. I was also required to give a full date instead of just a year. I was able to edit a house as a House Hunter ,1184566,1,8047
"The Readme file does not specify any information about how edge cases are handled but the edge cases were properly handled. when the real estate company was deleted all the houses and realtors under it were also deleted. However the role switch option between realtor and househunter is not available, further this operation cannot be performed manually also as the code resticts a mail id from being used for two accounts.",1193674,1,8047
"Upon testing the system for edge cases, the following results were obtained : 1. The real estate company is destroyed and the realtors houses and houses inquiries for the same are removed. 2. The realtor can switch to another company. They will be prohibited to remove the houses listed in the previous company though. 3. The house hunter accounts are deleted without their inquiries . 4. The System does not check for regex fr phone number input during signup.",1190686,1,8047
"The model test just tested the email attribute of the real estate company and the controller test mainly tested for successful responses and redirects, and not page content and method calls.",1195214,1,8047
"This team claimed to have fully tested the RealEstateCompany Model and Controller, but there were no tests in the RealEstateModel tests. I didn't check every file after since I don't like being lied to :)",1184567,1,8047
last moment commits.,1184221,1,8047
"Since I couldn't view the test plan,  i am unable to comment on it.",1208865,1,8072
The test plan seems to be missing,1207752,1,8072
I could not find any test plan or documentation and hence could not verify whether the tests have passed or no. Tests for checking for duplicate directories due to assignments having same names is missing.,1208610,1,8072
"As mentioned earlier, they have not considered testing at all at this point and hence, we are assuming that they are to implement testing at a further point in the project. Of course, mentioning an approach to the testing framework and how they would be going about it would have helped. Moreover, the absence of a wiki doc only adds to the grievances of being unable to decipher the problem statements. ",1206661,1,8072

"Names could have been better designed especially the 'quesparams' variable. I get no idea about what that variable is used for or what that implements. You can rename it to question_params, or duplicate_directory_params etc.",1208608,1,8072
"On checking, the code, we find that, in agreement with @TravisBuddy, the code had a build error which seems to be unresolved, which is strange, and should have been looked into. Moreover, the overall coverage shows a good amount of increase which is good. But one must say that the details in the code changes as few as they seem have been to a good extent for the majority of the part and thus worth the merit.",1206659,1,8072
Good work. Need to work on tests.,1203949,1,8072
There are no new variables etc. The code looks fine and logical.,1204405,-1,8072
The team has only made one significant change to the following file: app/controllers/assignments_controller.rb . It is an if statement which is difficult to follow since the team has not written any comments for the same.   Suggestion: The team could add comments and screenshots for better understand of the workflow in the second submission,1208851,1,8072
Extremely small change. No bad naming in question.,1205473,-1,8072
"I can guess the array 'quesparams' means question parameters, but this variable name is confusing, I think they should use question_param instead. ",1206385,1,8072
"Issue #1201 Below is the change made in _general.html.erb Directory name will be autogenerated if not provided. In the form of assignment name_id_course_id. The last part could be modified to something with a bit more clarity. From the assignments_controller code it could be seen that the auto-generated directory name follows the format <assignment name>_<assignment id>_<course_id> which is not what is specified in the text. There is a typo in the word 'autogenerated', it needs to be hyphenated as 'auto-generated'.   ",1203993,1,8072
There aren't much big changes. The changes have been crisp and self explanatory.,1208864,-1,8072
Comments needed.,1207751,1,8072
More comments are needed because I had trouble following what the code was doing in some places. The code follows Ruby Style Guide and is DRY in its design. Functions are small in size and naming conventions have been followed. Kudos!,1208609,1,8072
"1. Functions are of appropriate length and well structured with respect to the purpose in question.  2. All code has been suitably well put into the methods with their intended function and work cutout for them.  3.

Nope, all code is consistent and to the point. ",1206660,-1,8072
I feel you guys should add a few comments for a third person to follow.,1203950,1,8072

The author has commented out a method call. It would be beneficial to the person reading the code to understand the intention behind this. Please provide a detailed comment on why this was done.

"Since the test plan is not included, i am unable to do the manual testing.",1208866,1,8072

Action mirror successfully implemented . Active record is also getting updated properly.,1206409,-1,8062
There are some repetitions in the code which can be avoided by creating a helper function and calling that function from each place. But apart from that code is well thought out and implemented nicely.,1205285,1,8062
There were some issues initially when i looked at the code. But the professor has already made those suggestions about naming conventions and following the design pattern and to write appropriate methods in the right models or controllers. Looks good now.,1204866,-1,8062

"Looks good. Comments could be improved. For example, In submitted_content controller there is a comment which says sending email to users.

"The code changes in ""app/controllers/submitted_content_controller.rb"" line 60-78, could have been in a separate method, such as send ""email to reviewers"". That would make the controller code clean and clear.     Code changes does not follow the DRY principle in atleast two places. 1.  In app/mailers/delayed_mailer.rb, there is no need to duplicate the code. The code in the new method, review_reminder_email  has been copied from email_reminder. The email_reminder method can be used instead of creating a separate method altogether.   2. app/models/assignment_participant.rb and app/models/course_participant.rb uses a same code to send the emails via MailerHelper.send_mail_to_user , that can be put in one place, so that it can be reused in both the places.      ",1203982,1,8062
The code follows DRY principle. None of the functions is very long. More comments could be added but not required.,1202723,-1,8062
Code is not DRY. ,1207950,-1,8062
"I feel that the code from line 64 to 76 could have been written in a separate function to avoid making the function submit_hyperlink from becoming so large.  Additionally, the functionality inside the function review_reminder_email could have been separated into 2 different functions.",1206132,1,8062

Test plan is well thought out and thorough.,1205281,-1,8062
The authors have mentioned the test they have performed but no specific plan is presented. However they have adequate details about what is done and what is tested and how will the corresponding changes look like. edge case descriptions could have been included,1204862,1,8062
"The test case, does not handle the case when the imported csv is corrupted.",1203977,1,8062
"The ""Test Plan"" section is missing in the writeup. But, they have included a separate section for explaining Rspec based automated test cases.",1207181,1,8062
Yes conditions are tested well.,1207945,-1,8062
"The details regarding testing are mentioned in the writeup. But I did not find anything about the Test plan as such, in the writeup. The assignment_participant_spec contains a test.

Seems all variables and methods follow certain naming rules.,1206253,-1,8171
"The newly added code includes the attribute height, the getContext() and transferToImageBitmap() method in the OffscreenCanvas.webidl file. The name height given for the attribute height for the Canvas makes complete sense. Similarly the name getContext() given for the method that returns the OffscreenRenderingContext is also intuitive. The name transferToImageBitmap is a little long which might be the code less readable if the method is called often. Instead the accessor convention of using getImageBitmap() feels more intuitive and also logical at the same time.",1204545,1,8171

A little too brief.,1207631,1,8171
"The write-up gave a good introduction to the project by providing the background information about the Servo parallel web-engine project by Mozilla for web page rendering and Rust programming language to execute HTML5 and CSS3 parsers. It then highlighted the OffscreenCanvas API that can be used to generate frames and also return the rendered image using the transferToImageBitmap() method. The writeup covered how web workers can be used to implement OffscreenCanvas API to render images as an independent process isolated from the webpage. The problem statement of of creating OffscreenCanvas and OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2d interfaces with OffscreenCanvas Constructor, properties (width and height) and getContext() method was defined. The use of Web IDL to describe interfaces for web browsers was briefed and that was followed by the code flow and the code snippet of the two Web IDL files namely- OffScreenCanvas.webidl and OffScreenCanvasRenderingContext2D.webidl While the write-up was cogent and clearly explained the work done, it could have elaborated on the implementation of the methods like transferToImageBitmap() and how the interface is integrated into the system to render images in a webpage using an isolated web worker.",1204538,1,8171

"It is not explained why the work was done, the way it is done. But the implementation looks promising",1206941,1,8171
"The write-up did cover about the efficiency of Servo to render webpages quickly and smoothly when compared to Mozilla's other rendering engines. Servo does this using parallel layout, styling, web-renders and constellation and in turn sandboxes the processes, threads and tasks that allows the browser to fail better, hence making it more robust and secure. It justified the use of Rust to rewrite C++ and effectively the browser as well. ",1204539,1,8171

This was a testing project and the mocked objects were appropriate. The code is DRY. There is no redundancy in the code.,1207938,-1,8022
"So fresh and so clean, clean! This code is too neat to even be dry. Too hot to touch. I'm just still super impressed by the wiki and the video.",1208398,-1,8022
  ,1207452,-1,8022
All the code is in a single file as it tests a single model and it seems to cover it extensively. It also looks like there's no DRY issues.,1204430,-1,8022
Code seems to be concise and well written.,1205418,-1,8022
The code is mostly clear and easy to follow. Test blocks are succinct and contain one assertion per block. One exception is the #score method. It could be improved by decomposition. The code for set up could be extracted into a separate before(:each) block and multiple 'it' statements could be used for testing expectations.,1203732,1,8022
"1) No all functions are reasonably long if not too short. 2) No all methods seem about right 3) no but the team could have provided some comments in the score test function, as multiple expects are included 4) The code follows ruby guidelines and they used factories efficiently 5) Yes the code is DRY, they have used after each method to achieve it",1202995,1,8022
"The features work as intended, they cover the test cases and edge cases as well.",1207940,-1,8022
"After working through several edge case side effects, by hand, up hill, both ways, it looks like all of their bases are covered and edge cases satisfied.",1208400,-1,8022
  ,1207454,-1,8022
The features work as intended,1205894,-1,8022
"Since coverage is 100% and the code looks good to me, I am assuming it works fine.",1205420,-1,8022
"Tried to run the RSPEC test by copying the _spec.rb file and enusred that the Factory method is inserted, I got an error in 2 examples   Participant#email sends an email to the participant     Failure/Error: assignment = Assignment.find_by(id: self.assignment_id) Participant#score Get participant score within a round     Failure/Error: scores[questionnaire_symbol][:scores] = Answer.compute_scores(scores[questionnaire_symbol][:assessments], questions[questionnaire_symbol])     ",1204903,1,8022
Running the code manually resulted in the 100% coverage of the object under test.,1203734,-1,8022
yes all the test written passes. They could have written a test to check if self[:handle] is returned if no nil parameter is sent,1202997,1,8022
This wiki is very detailed and explains what is done for every tested method. It also contains links to all resources one may require to understand the functionalities of the project. Great Job guys !!!,1207930,-1,8022
" This is easily the most clear of any testing write-up that I have seen to-date. It is organized into meaningful sections that follow their test plan, and show of their deliverables.  ",1208390,-1,8022
"The wiki page provides clear details about the work, and very easy to understand. ",1207444,-1,8022
The writeup is clear and easy to understand.,1205884,-1,8022
"Yes, it is easy understand that it is a testing project and how it is done.",1204422,-1,8022
"Under 'tested methods' they have explained everything really nicely. The video is just to long, 22 minutes. You have have made it short.",1205410,1,8022
Team could have given more description on what is the Participant.rb is doing,1204893,1,8022
The wiki clearly defines the primary objective of the project and justifies the reasoning behind introduction of additional helper constructs like participant factory. The authors complement the descriptions of each test case with associated block of code and elaborate on the details of their inner workings. I would suggest removing parts like high level descriptions of Expertiza and Unit Tests (http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/index.php/OSS_E1852.rb#Unit_Test_Description) because they are redundant in this context.,1203724,1,8022
"Yes, the team has efficiently detailed all the details about the projects and the need for their changes to providing code of their changes. They have also attached coverage and test run screen shots for references.",1202987,0,8022
"The test plan section is really well written. However, pre-conditions, edge cases are not very well discussed and talked about. I would suggest the team to add these into the wiki as well.",1207933,1,8022
"Magic. How did they know they needed a Test Plan?!? They did a great job laying out how they created an environment to unit test Participant with their design choice, and chosen variables and factories.",1208393,1,8022
looks like edge cases and invalid inputs are handled.,1207447,-1,8022
The test plan look complete enough.,1205887,-1,8022
The plan looks good and it covers a lot of cases.,1204425,-1,8022
"the write up doesn't has a test plan but looking at the code it seems they have check every edge case. Also since there coverage is coming to to be 100% , everything should work.",1205413,-1,8022
The test plan is comprehensive and fully covers all the methods and cases that are part of the object under test. Running the test suite yields 100% overall coverage.,1203727,-1,8022
"Yes they have come up with all possible inputs, edge cases and wrong data entries to check the system behaviour is not faulty",1202990,-1,8022
"For every tested method, they explain what they did and why they did it.",1207931,-1,8022
 They even wrote down their plan to accomplish the project! I love it.,1208391,-1,8022
"It is a testing task, I assume there is not any design needed.",1207445,-1,8022
Yes.,1205885,-1,8022
It explains clearly what tests are missing and how the coverage is increased.,1204423,-1,8022
Yes they have explained everything.,1205411,-1,8022
"The authors mostly focus on how they did what they did, i.e. inner workings of each test suite. Little to no discussion is provided on the overall decisions pertaining to design principles and patterns that have been utilized in this project. For example, there are no instances of before(:each) blocks in the source code. This decision could be discussed and clarified in the wiki page.",1203725,1,8022
They team has thought through efficiently to use design options that avoid test reruns and to dry out some mocks settings,1202988,-1,8022
The team has not added any test cases.,1202492,1,8025
No new tests have been written,1204724,1,8025
No test cases / Test plans,1207566,1,8025

There is no Test plan.,1203875,1,8025
Test cases are not being taken cared.,1205985,1,8025
All the variables and function names used are appropriate. ,1202490,-1,8025
"The variables, names are well assigned.",1208687,-1,8025
"There a large set of variables that do not follow typical ruby naming convention. An example is that ""existAssignment"" should be ""exit_assignment"". Additionally, some names are not very helpful. For instance, the variable ""frm"" is used for a form, but why not just use ""form""? There is also a lot of javascript written directly on the page and are difficult to read and understand as there is missing method names or other non-intuitive variable names",1208097,1,8025
"The code is clear and concise. The variable, method and class name choice is correct.  One variable i feel can be changed is  top_max_choosers can be renamed to topic_max_slots, as slots has been used in the function name as well and it will be more consisted  ",1204722,1,8025
"For the Ruby changes they have made, they have used intuitive names and used naming conventions as much as possible. def update_feedback   Some places, the variable names are used in CamelCase whereas few places they werent used. Few variable names were directly used from legacy code, although refactoring could have been done. curquestionnaire quesparams . questArray",1207564,1,8025
"Most of the variable names and function names are named based on proper convention. Suggestion: function addCreateTopicSection()This function name could be changed to maybe CreateTopic() or AddTopic()Apart form this, all other names look good",1208014,1,8025
"All the variables are defined with respect to the functionality like - max_team_size, get_participants_without_team.",1203873,1,8025
Functions and variables are named aptly,1205449,-1,8025
Ruby coding standard has been followed. Only one function has been added in controller as per requirement. Code follows DRY principle. The team can add comments for the code added which would be useful to understand the code.,1202491,1,8025
"def create function in assignments controller seems to be long and could have been refactored. Considering that they used most of the legacy code and most of their work was on UI, their part on ruby changes werent much ",1207565,1,8025
"The team has written a concise and efficient code with proper implementation. However, some additional comments in some parts would improve the readability and make it easier to comprehend",1208015,1,8025
The code is well structured. Could have added more comments for easy understanding of the code. The functions are not long.,1203874,1,8025
"Functions are of appropriate length and code is in proper methods. However, no comments are provided what so ever.  ",1205450,1,8025
"The group has not shared the link for the test environment. Hence unable to test the edge cases. However, in the screen cast they have covered the functionalities mentioned in the requirement document.",1202493,1,8025
I have not been supplied with a link to manually use an instance with their changes and I have not been able to find a link in their PR or write-up.,1208100,1,8025
I could not run it locally and hence I am not sure about the edge cases. Code looks clean and should not break in most of the cases,1204725,1,8025
"The youtube screenshare clearly shows the changes made and works perfectly. Since the edge cases arent defined, not sure about the functionalities of edge cases in this case as it involves UI most of the time",1207567,1,8025
"There is no link provided to test the code manually. However from the video provided, I can infer that all the features have been implemented and are working properly. Issue #718 and #926 are working as expected. In issue #971, I could see that the previous version of the 'add new topic' page had a topic description and topic category field which is not seen in the updated version. Suggestion: The team could implement that or if already implemented, add that to the wiki page to reflect the way in which that is handled",1208017,1,8025
The features work as intended. Edge cases are properly executed.  ,1203876,-1,8025
The code works.,1205452,-1,8025
"No deployment is provided, so couldn't test manually. ",1205986,1,8025
The write up addresses details of all the three problem statements along with the code changes done in every file and the files added. The team has also added screenshots of the manual testing and the video demonstrating the functionality they added.,1202483,-1,8025
"The write up covers all the issues and is well organized, including the code blocks and the screenshots.",1208680,-1,8025
"I was able to understand the changes they were making and why, however I thought the write-up was a little too verbose and had too much code - I can find the code in their PR.",1208090,1,8025
The Documentation is well written and indicated clearly what was the problem tackled and how it was approached and solved,1204715,-1,8025
"The writeup s format on how they distinguished the features and explained solutions for each and everything is good. First they give a bird's eye view of the problems and then deep diving into each problem with solution and screenshot is good. The background explanation given could have been more specific towards their problem statement, rather than just about expertiza. The images tend to occupy the entire page and its little difficult while going through it, a little foramatting could have made their page really good.",1207557,1,8025
"Yes, the team has clearly stated the problem statement and the changes they have done to provide solutions to the problem. They have been given 3 problems to which they have clearly provided the names of the files and the part of the code which is changed. The video explains the problem and the implemented solution perfectly without any ambiguity.",1208007,-1,8025
The write up clearly explains about the modifications made in Expertiza.  It indicates the functionality of their work which is topic management and the problem statement is clearly elaborated. It provides the files changed and also the code snippets in which the changes are made. The write up also provides visual representations of the changes made. ,1203866,-1,8025
"writeup is very well written, contains enough screenshots and explanations of the code.",1205442,-1,8025
The write-up is well explained but could have described more on the methods whey implemented and why did it implement in a certain way.,1205976,1,8025
The team has not included any test cases. It would be easy to include the test cases on the  app/controllers/suggestion_controller for the update_feedback method that has been added. Also the team may add some features test cases as most of the changes made are in html files. The team can refer the existing features present in the .spec/features folder.,1202486,1,8025

There is no test plan.,1203869,1,8025
No test cases or test plan mentioned in the write-up.,1205979,1,8025
The team has explained the issue and the solution they chose with enough details to understand to way of implementation.,1202484,-1,8025
"They explained it well, but there were no larger design patterns they seemed to be following. I did think that they used AJAX in the appropriate way, but it could be improved in the future.",1208091,1,8025
"Their solutions are well explained. The way they have explained, attaching a screenshot of a code snippet and telling, this is where we made this change, and this is how it works, gives a better understanding of their project. It could have been better if they could have compare and contrasted the previous codes, where the features where not there. That way, the background of the why this feature could have been clear.",1207558,1,8025
"Yes, the team has explained their code and the reason for the additions made. However, for the issue #926, some more information about the Tablesorter and some additional comments would improve the writeup. Solutions to issue #718 and #971 are explained clearly and are easy to follow.",1208008,1,8025
Design patterns were not used. Rest of the code is explained and easy to follow.,1203867,1,8025
Code snippets are given but need explanation. ,1205977,1,8025
"Writeup explains what was to be done and how they did it, but does not give rationale behind the way they coded, and any alternative approaches.",1205443,1,8025
The test plan is not about what they test in the Rspec test.,1207370,1,8080

Test cases are present. ,1206435,-1,8080
Yes all 17 test cases are automated,1205048,-1,8080
They have not yet reached the desired goal of 90% coverage.,1203799,0,8080
Everything in the wiki was a test.,1204135,-1,8080
"It seems you have cover 94% of the participant.rb. However, all checks have failed in the pull request test.",1205519,-1,8080
"Yes, the admin has included the Test Plan cases in the automated tests.",1208346,-1,8080
The authors have implemented every test case that is discussed in the test plan. Detailed explanations and code itself is provided in the project's wiki page.,1202676,-1,8080

Coverage has increased by 7 percent overall,1205046,-1,8080
The added tests look very clean.,1204133,-1,8080
Pull request build passes well and there are no issues.,1208344,-1,8080
"Most of the naming is reasonable and follows standard Ruby practices.  One problem is that code makes extensive use of variable names concatenated with numbers. Example: allow(participant3).to receive(:topic).and_return(topic) Here it is not clear what distinguishes participant3 from other participants and why it is special. It would be better to avoid using contractions such as stu1 or p1 (.sort_by_name method, Line 130). Furthermore, I would suggest using consistent indentation (for example .get_authorization method, Line 113).",1202674,1,8080
"The code looks clean. Though I don't understand why you have used this line in the test for responses "" puts participant.response_maps"". I feel some of the code that isnt needed is commented out. Please remove this code as it was mentioned in the details. Naming and cnventions seem to be fine.",1207369,1,8080
"the code looks clean . However, some of the comments are not provided for the test cases. apart from this the naming and the conventions seem to be fine",1207907,1,8080
FuncyFunctionalare of correct length.,1206434,-1,8080
Does not apply as its a testing project with most testcases written in a single Rspec file to test the functionality,1205047,-1,8080
The test for sort_by_name redundantly checks implementation parts. It needs only to test the result.,1203798,1,8080
"CodeClimate bot reports 73 style issues, which is an awful lot. ",1204134,1,8080
There is no need to use the student3 and participant3.,1205518,1,8080
"Well, the code looks good and very much follows the Ruby Style Guide. The code also is DRY. It looks well written and does not any changes.",1208345,-1,8080
"The code is concise and readable. It consists of mostly small methods that test one thing. One exception is #.sort_by_name method where several assertions are made in one method. It would be better to use several 'it' statements and DRY out the code by utilizing before(:each) statement. One further suggestion would be to shorten the code by using one array statements instead of individual expressions. For example replace: stu1 = build(:student, name: ""Student1"") stu2 = build(:student, name: ""Student2"")   stu3 = build(:student, name: ""Student3"") with: students = (0..2).map { |i| build(:student, name: ""Student#{i}"") }  ",1202675,1,8080
"Yep, the spec.rb file works fine. I think only handle method hasn't been tested. This is why the coverage seems to be 94%",1207371,1,8080
Yes all the features work as intended. The participant that is created using the build method describes participant as an instance of the assignment participant class. I observed the handle method has not been tested yet.,1207909,1,8080
Video covers how to run the test cases which are clear and understandable.,1206436,-1,8080
Tests work,1205049,-1,8080
Some cases haven't been implemented yet.,1203800,0,8080
"Tests in the file pass, according to the video, but less than 100% coverage implies that corner cases aren't being handled.",1204136,1,8080
"No, the test failed.",1205520,1,8080
"Yes, after testing the work manually, I could see that their features are working as intended.",1208347,-1,8080
Features implemented in this project work as intended. After running the code manually I am getting the same coverage as stated on the wiki page. One problem is that the main object under test - participant is created using build method. factories.rb describes participant as an instance of AssignmentParticipant class. There is a possibility that this is complicating test cases or will complicate them in the future. The solution is to either define a new Participant class instance in the factory or to define it in the code itself.,1202677,1,8080
"The Wiki is descriptive and covers the essentials of the project. In my opinion, I think the code for every test is not required. It is enough to explain the structure and code for one test, maybe and what each test is supposed to do for the rest of the tests. That should suffice.",1207361,1,8080
the document contains the whole information including the test plans and the the expertiza environment setup. It is neatly documented as well which makes it more readable,1207899,0,8080
Project purpose is write test cases for participant model and increase the test coverage. This seems to be easily understandable but plan of work should nainly concentrate on how we test this functionality rather than just mentioning that test cases need to be written.,1206426,1,8080
The doc says participant.rb model is  changed. However that file is not currently committed. However assignment_participant model file is committed. Seems to be some mismatch at one of the places. Correcting it will help in understanding what work is done and how does it impact the functionality.,1205039,1,8080
The write is very descriptive and included code from both the model and the spec file.,1203790,-1,8080
The writeup explains how the tests relate to their respective methods.,1204126,-1,8080
very clearly writeup.,1205510,-1,8080
"It is well written, quite understandable. It clearly and adequately indicates the working functionality. I can understand what the project is about.",1208337,-1,8080
The problem being addressed by this project is defined cogently without any ambiguities. Test cases are considered separately starting with description of the given method followed by how the functionality is being tested. I would suggest removing parts like Expertiza description (http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/index.php/User_talk:Rshakya#Expertiza) and rationale behind using Rspec (http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/index.php/User_talk:Rshakya#Unit_Testing_with_RSpec) because those parts fall out of the scope of this topic.,1202667,1,8080
The test plan does not include details on preconditions or edge cases. I suggest the team to elaborate on Test Plan. Otherwise a good start.,1207364,1,8080
Yes the test appears complete as they have mentioned all from setting up the expertiza environment to the tests that they have implemented along with the plan of the they executed their project,1207902,-1,8080
Test plan is not included however they have included the diffeedif test cases implemented and the exolaexplan is good.,1206429,1,8080
 A more through explanation of what each testcase does will be useful. Its documented well about what the testcase will return but not what it does. Mentioning that will be useful,1205042,1,8080
"The test plan could be more specific. For example ""Writing testing conditions for different functions"" doesn't indicate what strategies are being employed or what edge cases are being tested.",1203793,1,8080
"The document states they have a 77% LoC coverage, but the assignment description states they need at least 90%. This is not complete.",1204129,1,8080
"Yes, the Test Plan looks complete and includes all the test cases and the actions.",1208340,-1,8080
"Scenarios that are discussed in the wiki have comprehensive descriptions and justifications. However, clearly a number of edge cases are not considered as the test coverage is ~77%.   I would suggest using mock objects which will both decouple tests from database and increase the overall coverage.  For example mocking find_by method of TeamsUser would allow covering participant#team case: allow(TeamsUser).to receive(:find_by).with(user: student).and_return(team)   Another minor issue is that wiki is missing some cases that are implemented in the code (#team, #fullname, #scores).",1202670,1,8080
"They have mentioned that they use ""factory"", but it hasn't been mentioned clearly how they use factories. It would be great if they can incorporate this in the Wiki.",1207362,1,8080
Yes the have mentioned all of the required work and its related explanation. they have reasoned out their exact methods and the issues to be considered while testing in the problem statement. ,1207900,-1,8080
Functionalities have been tested properly.,1206427,-1,8080
 Looks good. Explains what work is done and what is the corresponding output,1205040,0,8080
"The writeup explains why the tests they write relate to their respective methods, but doesn't justify a 77% LoC coverage, which is below the requirements for the project.",1204127,1,8080
"Yes, the writeup explains explains how the authors did their work and they have mentioned the steps behind each functionality. They have put a video explanation of the same.",1208338,-1,8080
"Authors describe the strategy they utilized for tackling the project and the detailed mechanics of each test case. However, there is no mention of specific design decisions or patterns that were used in the implementation. My suggestion is for the team to elaborate on technical decisions made for simplifying test cases for example the majority of mock objects is created at the beginning before every 'it' statement.",1202668,1,8080
The test plan was not present. But the team have done a good job in implementing tests.,1208757,1,8103
"Yes, it looks they have converted all the cases into the Test Plan.",1207099,-1,8103
The test cases have been developed into automated tests however edge cases or failing cases have not been considered. Only simple and straightforward scenarios have been tested. The video shows the test cases and the document shows the coverage. The document is well made.,1206621,1,8103
Good work on including test cases. The app works fine after testing.,1205937,-1,8103
Yes most of them but they have not added any automated integration tests. Unit testing has been done and is great to see such detailed tests,1206769,-1,8103
All the test plan is converted to automated testing.,1205495,-1,8103
They did not have a Test Plan.,1205203,1,8103
The variable and method names are apt.,1208755,-1,8103
Class and variables are name correctly. get_bookmark_rating_response_map is an not an apt name for a function. The word bookmark can be omitted in function and variable names inside the bookmark controller. .when a student requests a bookmark it should show a bookmark test is failing,1207097,1,8103
"Yes. the variables have been very keenly named. Especially in the file, _rubric.html.erb, the variables are very accurately and effectively named, as there could have been much confusion otherwise. Kudos for that.",1203861,-1,8103
All methods and variables are suggestive of the functionality. Only some of the code changes are explained and reason of taking a particular problem solving approach is lacking. ,1206619,1,8103
"The variables, methods and class names are aptly named. I could not find names which are not suggestive of functionality.",1205935,-1,8103
"Build fails, pls look into it.  BookmarkRatingResponseMap has been replaced by BookmarkRatingQuestionnaire but the earlier naming convention just by looking at the name let the reader understand the data structure being used. I would have liked similar approach here.    ",1206767,1,8103
The code follows standards. ,1203841,-1,8103
"Use of a few variables is hard to understand. For e.g. : x.assignment.id  Otherwise, most variables and classes are aptly named.",1205493,1,8103
The code follows the DRY principle.,1208756,-1,8103
3,1207098,-1,8103
The code follows most of the standard practices except the 3rd one. It does falls short of comments. It took a very long time to make sense of what the changes made by the author in a particular file does. This scenario could be improved in the future iterations.,1203862,1,8103
More comments are needed because I had trouble following what the code was doing in some places. The code follows Ruby Style Guide and is DRY in its design. Functions are small in size and naming conventions have been followed. Good work in this area.,1206620,1,8103
"Great work. Clearly Understandable. Functions are of appropriate length, Codes are in appropriate methods, Code is very well commented, Code follows ruby style guide. Good naming.  ",1205936,-1,8103
Function names look good. And most of them have len < 20 which is good.  The tests make use of contexts effectively. This is great to see.    Yes more comments are required especially in the controller code telling why an approach was taken and what the function does.   ,1206768,1,8103
Code is clean and variable names are readable. Need a bit of formatting as some lines are not 'aligned' well. ,1203842,1,8103
" The code is well written, follows ruby guidelines and functions are of appropriate length.   No comments are provided what so ever, making the huge code change very difficult to follow.",1205494,1,8103
They do work as intended.,1208758,-1,8103
Cases mentioned seem to be working fine. Can be a bit descriptive about the steps though.,1207100,1,8103
All of the features mentioned by the author works successfully in the demonstration as well as in the manual tests performed by me.,1203864,-1,8103
The features work as intended however I am having trouble navigating and checking what are the differences between the original system and the improved system. Could have made a demo video showing the improvements or a step guide to follow.,1206622,1,8103
Could not detect any flaws. Works exactly as it has been been in the wiki. Good guidance. ,1205938,-1,8103
"Yes.  I suggestion, since they deployed the code and video, it would have been good if they put a view of the UI usage similar to what they have put as screen shots in the code.   ",1206770,1,8103
"Tested in the links given, the changes are working correct. The server is up and I was able to reflect the steps mentioned. ",1203844,-1,8103
"I can find where is the bookmarks page, but according to their screenshots I think their features work well.",1205204,-1,8103
The write-ups been written well. A small suggestion to the team would be to explain their solutions in more detail as it would better the understanding of what the project does. Also the team could use code snippets instead of screenshots of the code.,1208748,1,8103
The writeup seems apt. I had a little problem understanding the solution to problem 1 but otherwise it seems fine,1207090,1,8103
"The write-up is very clear and directs user to the main issue very well. The flow is very structured, in the sense that first it gives a high level view of what expertiza is, it then tells about the book-mark functionality, and then tells the problem and how they came up with the solution. One of the most professional wiki I've reviewed.",1203854,-1,8103
The method names and variable names are very well defined ! The best I have seen so far ! No clear explanation is given as to which files are edited for which reason. Only file names are stated along with changes made. Why the changes were made and what do those changes correct is not given.,1206612,1,8103
The writeup is clear. It is easy to understand what the project does.   ,1205928,-1,8103
Write up is good. Great job. However I could find few points that if rectified would make it even better.  It would be good if the problem statement could list the issue (hyperlinks) that are being fixed. That would make it easier to navigate Instead of pasting screen shot for solution it would have been good if few words detailing approach would be put. Post that screen shot could be put.  ,1206760,1,8103
"The write-up was splendid. All instructions were written thoroughly. I did not face any problem in understanding. Also, screenshots guided well",1203834,-1,8103
"Write-up clearly explains with screenshots what is done. However, does not say how the changes have been implemented.",1205486,1,8103
The test plan is not there.,1208751,1,8103
They have included a test model video in which all the test are passing. It looks complete,1207093,-1,8103
"Yes. The test plan is present in the writeup. Also, the links to youtube videos for the demonstration was particularly helpful too.",1203857,-1,8103
"The Test Plan was comprehensive. However, in the video they could have explained which screens and which methods they were testing instead of just showing some test cases pass on the screen.",1206615,1,8103
"The authors considered different pre-conditions, edge cases, invalid input values, and other possibilities and i clearly well written. Test Plan looks complete",1205931,-1,8103
"  Yes they have a test section. The amount of coverage added for the new tests is great. Keep it up, however I would have liked that the authors added more negative cases as part of t heir unit tests.  I see mostly the +ve test cases being handled in the tests.   ",1206763,1,8103
"Yes, I followed the youtube link to check the tests and they have tested the controllers. ",1203837,-1,8103
Testplen looks exhaustive and is explained well.,1205489,-1,8103
"They don't have Test Plan section, but they added some screenshots of the test result, I can see they have pretty good path coverage. But I can not know if they test edge cases or invalid input values without seeing their Test Plan.",1205197,-1,8103
The writeup is well written. But I feel there are some missing details about the project. The team could elaborate on the issues in the project and the solution that they have implemented. This way it would better in understanding how and why the authors did the work that they did.,1208749,1,8103
It mentions what they did but doesn't highlight why they chose to implement that way. Don't seem to have implemented any design pattern as well.,1207091,1,8103
"The writeup expalins clearly enough what the authors did. Though, the part of ""Why"" the authors did what they did isn't elaborated with much depth. From the authors perspective, the articles seems exhaustive and comprehensive, but for a person reviewing the article, who doesn't have much background of the problem at hand, the article make it tough to decipher why certain program is written the way it is. ",1203855,1,8103
"The authors do not explain why they did the word the way they did. Entirely new pages have been created with no indication as to why those pages were needed . Old redundant code has been commented but not deleted. Naming and code pattern wise, very good job.",1206613,1,8103
"Writeup does not mention anything about how the code works, alternative strategies possible or strategies they used.",1205487,1,8103
"The write-up only tells what is to be done and how it is done. The rational behind choosing the approach is not mentioned, neither are any of the principles mentioned. It has comparisons between the previous and new versions and why they made they made the necessary modifications.",1205929,1,8103
No. I think the authors should have mentioned why a particular solution was taken. What was the main driving force for taking the approach that they have taken. This was entirely missing. Pls work on that. They could also remove much of the commented code.        ,1206761,1,8103
"Yes, the problem statement was explained thoroughly. Also, the team very aptly described why the issue needs to be fixed. great work !",1203835,-1,8103
"I didn't find any information about how and why they did the work, they only show me what are the issues and the results after they fixed these issues, for example, in problem 2, they told me their is an average rating metric bug and they fixed the bug, but they said nothing about how they fixed the bug.",1205195,1,8103

Edge cases missing from the test case. Write more test cases with invalid input types. Example - give a string to an int type and raise an error accordingly.,1203715,1,8112
"Since the project involved deletion of obsolete methods and SQL, it would be good to explicitly state in the test plan if there were any tests previously that used these methods/SQL. Also, if they are present they need to be modified. ",1206115,1,8112
Authors have converted test plan into an appropriate test case. Suggestion:   The authors can improve the writeup if they elaborate more on the testing approach used for the newly added code.,1204449,1,8112
just one scenario has been tested and couldn't see any further test plan documented. ,1207248,1,8112
"The team has done great job by describing the approach and explaining same in detail by adding a pictorial representation of the pattern used. However, it would be more helpful if the team could add details about the names of the classes and the exact code changes done in the wiki page. As it would help anyone in future to understand what are the exact changes implemented. In this way the comparing code with the original code in github can be avoided.",1205151,1,8112
"Yes, it does explain the previous functionality and their changes will take affect. The explanation is done with diagram as well as the query.",1208927,-1,8112
"Yes, explains well.",1207840,-1,8112
clearly explained about the implementation and usage of the strategy pattern ,1204367,-1,8112
Yes very well written. I would have given full marks if you would have added code snippet and screenshot of the before and after feature. Visually it would have been great to understand the changes quickly.,1203713,1,8112
It would be good if the functionality of the obsolete methods(that were removed during the refactoring) is mentioned; and also explain why they were obsolete.,1206113,1,8112
The authors clearly explain how they refactored the code.  ,1204447,-1,8112
They explained how they used Strategy Pattern and why they used it. Loved the walkthrough!,1207246,-1,8112
I could see a clear description of the changes and good naming conventions ,1206037,-1,8112
The test plan was not present. But the team have done a good job in implementing tests.,1208757,1,8050
"Yes, it looks they have converted all the cases into the Test Plan.",1207099,-1,8050
The test cases have been developed into automated tests however edge cases or failing cases have not been considered. Only simple and straightforward scenarios have been tested. The video shows the test cases and the document shows the coverage. The document is well made.,1206621,1,8050
Good work on including test cases. The app works fine after testing.,1205937,-1,8050
Yes most of them but they have not added any automated integration tests. Unit testing has been done and is great to see such detailed tests,1206769,1,8050
All the test plan is converted to automated testing.,1205495,-1,8050
They did not have a Test Plan.,1205203,1,8050
The variable and method names are apt.,1208755,-1,8050
Class and variables are name correctly. get_bookmark_rating_response_map is an not an apt name for a function. The word bookmark can be omitted in function and variable names inside the bookmark controller. .when a student requests a bookmark it should show a bookmark test is failing,1207097,1,8050
"Yes. the variables have been very keenly named. Especially in the file, _rubric.html.erb, the variables are very accurately and effectively named, as there could have been much confusion otherwise. Kudos for that.",1203861,-1,8050
All methods and variables are suggestive of the functionality. Only some of the code changes are explained and reason of taking a particular problem solving approach is lacking. ,1206619,1,8050
"The variables, methods and class names are aptly named. I could not find names which are not suggestive of functionality.",1205935,-1,8050
"Build fails, pls look into it.  BookmarkRatingResponseMap has been replaced by BookmarkRatingQuestionnaire but the earlier naming convention just by looking at the name let the reader understand the data structure being used. I would have liked similar approach here.    ",1206767,1,8050
The code follows standards. ,1203841,-1,8050
"Use of a few variables is hard to understand. For e.g. : x.assignment.id  Otherwise, most variables and classes are aptly named.",1205493,1,8050
There aren't any test cases listed in the writeup. Can explain the test cases a bit in the github commit message.,1206351,1,8089
Test plan not included,1208829,1,8089
Testing has been done well. Testing could have been more extensive. Currently the system only tests if the responses are correct for proper input. Blank or no input or failing cases should also have been tested.,1208411,1,8089
Everything seems to be working fine,1203963,-1,8089
Existing test cases have been fixed for review feedback by a team instead of a team member.,1207547,-1,8089
No cases were mentioned in the Test Plan hence could not tell it is converted into automated tests. Please elaborate it.  ,1206267,1,8089
"As stated above, the writeup has a missing test plan which could be added by the team for the second iteration of the submission.",1208087,1,8089
Couldn't see any testing being done.,1207163,1,8089
The team has modified the existing test cases to cover the new changes made. But this is not detailed in the Test Plan. ,1204027,1,8089
Naming looks fine. Could probably have used is_submitted? instead of is_submitted.,1206349,1,8089
Naming of classes and variables are apt.,1208827,-1,8089
All methods and variables are suggestive of the functionality. The vm_question_reponse table could have been named/edited to be named in a more descriptive way. I do not understand what is the meaning of VM.,1208409,1,8089
"Everything looks fine, except for a few places where there are issues with indentation.",1203961,1,8089
All method names are suggestive of the functionality they provide.,1207545,-1,8089
"A small suggestion , new_feedback --> author_new_feedback The variables, methods and class names are aptly named. I could not find names which are not suggestive of functionality.",1206265,1,8089
The team has properly used the naming conventions for variables and functions. The functionality could be easily interpreted by reading the name,1208085,-1,8089
The code follows the DRY principle.,1208756,-1,8050
3,1207098,-1,8050
"All the names are reasonable except for a few like the function name ""get_feedback_assessments_for"". It is ambiguous as to what the function will be doing.",1207161,1,8089
The code follows most of the standard practices except the 3rd one. It does falls short of comments. It took a very long time to make sense of what the changes made by the author in a particular file does. This scenario could be improved in the future iterations.,1203862,1,8050
grades_helper.rb:62 The parameter id is not descriptive enough. Please consider changing it to be more descriptive. ,1204025,1,8089
Basic test cases are covered in the test plan,1208986,-1,8106
More comments are needed because I had trouble following what the code was doing in some places. The code follows Ruby Style Guide and is DRY in its design. Functions are small in size and naming conventions have been followed. Good work in this area.,1206620,1,8050
"Team has taken care of test plan with automated test cases. As mention by team, they have implemented capybara testing and has good understanding of it.",1206077,-1,8106
All tests added pass.,1204523,-1,8106
"Great work. Clearly Understandable. Functions are of appropriate length, Codes are in appropriate methods, Code is very well commented, Code follows ruby style guide. Good naming.  ",1205936,-1,8050
"Yes, the admin has included the Test Plan cases in the automated tests.",1207963,-1,8106
Include test cases for negative scenarios as well.,1203897,-1,8106
Function names look good. And most of them have len < 20 which is good.  The tests make use of contexts effectively. This is great to see.    Yes more comments are required especially in the controller code telling why an approach was taken and what the function does.   ,1206768,1,8050
"The code has comments at the beginning of the functionality. Could have added some more comments where the functions are larger for followup. Can add why a certain change in the fetching process was made, so that next time it can be referred while coding further.",1206350,1,8089
Up to standards with ruby coding practices,1208828,-1,8089
"As given in wiki for their test plan,  The admin tests include building and deleting both Administrator and Instructor accounts using Capybara for testing the front-end web functionality. it 'delete instructor successfully' do it 'delete admin successfully' do To test the role creation, Capybara was again used to check that the web page did not have any button for ""New Role"" and that navigating to the page manually resulted in an error. it 'should not create a new role and redirect to index page when ""new"" method is called' do.   Although they havent explained the edge cases and negative inputs in the wiki, their test cases cover whatever has been discussed",1207242,1,8106
Code is clean and variable names are readable. Need a bit of formatting as some lines are not 'aligned' well. ,1203842,1,8050
I do not see any test plan in the writeup.,1203907,1,8106
More comments are needed because I am having trouble following the code. The code follows Ruby Style Guide and is DRY in its design. Functions are small in size and naming conventions have been followed. Good work in this area.,1208410,1,8089
The code is well modularized and separate methods have been created to provide different functionality. eg: added get_feedback_assessment method to add feedback for a team.,1207546,-1,8089
"Methods, variables and class names are well defined as per the standards. ",1208984,-1,8106
" The code is well written, follows ruby guidelines and functions are of appropriate length.   No comments are provided what so ever, making the huge code change very difficult to follow.",1205494,1,8050
The code has all 5 of the following characteristics: (i) is DRY (ii) follows Ruby style guide (iii) is commented (iv) does not contain long methods (v) variables and functions are properly named.,1206266,-1,8089
"The team has done well to follow the Ruby Style Guide and has ensured to keep the code DRY. However, my suggesstion is to add comments in the code for the reader to follow the code easily.",1208086,1,8089
They do work as intended.,1208758,-1,8050
"The comments were sparse. Maybe, coming up with a few words before every method would make the project more understandable.",1207162,1,8089
Cases mentioned seem to be working fine. Can be a bit descriptive about the steps though.,1207100,1,8050
The team has done a good job of maintaining the code DRY and as neat as possible. No suggestions to improve.,1204026,-1,8089
All of the features mentioned by the author works successfully in the demonstration as well as in the manual tests performed by me.,1203864,-1,8050
The features work as intended however I am having trouble navigating and checking what are the differences between the original system and the improved system. Could have made a demo video showing the improvements or a step guide to follow.,1206622,1,8050
Could not detect any flaws. Works exactly as it has been been in the wiki. Good guidance. ,1205938,-1,8050
"Variables, methods and class names are given professionally with reasonable meaning. The names very well indicate the functionality to be performed by the name/variable.  ",1206075,-1,8106
The code added in the project uses intuitive naming conventions. Good job guys !!,1204521,-1,8106
Pull request build passe well and there are no issues.,1207961,-1,8106
"Yes.  I suggestion, since they deployed the code and video, it would have been good if they put a view of the UI usage similar to what they have put as screen shots in the code.   ",1206770,-1,8050
Build is failing. Correct it by understanding the reason. Good job on Ruby standards for the naming convention.,1203893,1,8106
The code seems to work for basic required functionality. Need to add more number of edge cases with test results where there is a possibility of a failure and a look into the work around is required.,1206352,1,8089
"Tested in the links given, the changes are working correct. The server is up and I was able to reflect the steps mentioned. ",1203844,-1,8050
features are working as intended.,1208830,-1,8089
Function names seemed to be clear enough and satisfactory.,1208767,-1,8106
Names are clearly used and defined as given. def remove_administrator redirect_to action: 'list_administrators def remove_instructor  ,1207240,-1,8106
"I can find where is the bookmarks page, but according to their screenshots I think their features work well.",1205204,-1,8050
The newly added code does not resolve the previous issues to great extent.,1203905,1,8106
The author's work runs smoothly. It could have been better had they provided a short demo video. I could not figure out where were the changes made in the system. They could have written the navigation steps. Directly giving the flow without any context is tough to understand.,1208412,1,8089
Functions are not long but are sufficient enough to understand what changes are made and how they are implemented,1208985,-1,8106
"1. Function written are simple, crisp and clear. No long functions or dead lines of codes 2. Team has taken care of modularization. No part of code needs to be added as separate  method 3. Code and names given to variable do help to understand the flow of the code. 4. Code follows Ruby style guide. 5. DRY principle is followed very well within the two functions changed.",1206076,-1,8106
"I would only suggest you to add more comments to your code. I know that no comments were previously added for you to feed off of, but I guess a major aspect of these OSS projects is to add as many comments as possible to the existing code.",1204522,1,8106
"Well, the code looks good and very much follows the Ruby Style Guide. The code also is DRY. It looks well written and does not any changes.",1207962,-1,8106
The write-ups been written well. A small suggestion to the team would be to explain their solutions in more detail as it would better the understanding of what the project does. Also the team could use code snippets instead of screenshots of the code.,1208748,1,8050
"method remove_instructor is written twice in the same file, delete it.",1203895,1,8106
The code seemed fine and follows the ruby guide style. I could understand the flow of the code and what different functions did.,1208768,-1,8106
The writeup seems apt. I had a little problem understanding the solution to problem 1 but otherwise it seems fine,1207090,1,8050
"They have explained about how they are using DRY principles in wiki. Refactoring a new method like,  def self.destroy_helper(params, position) in (users_controller.rb) clearly explains the DRY method being used ",1207241,-1,8106
"The write-up is very clear and directs user to the main issue very well. The flow is very structured, in the sense that first it gives a high level view of what expertiza is, it then tells about the book-mark functionality, and then tells the problem and how they came up with the solution. One of the most professional wiki I've reviewed.",1203854,-1,8050
Functions are really small and absurd. Does not go along Ruby Style guide.,1203906,1,8106
The deployed setup cant be reached. The site is not up.,1208987,1,8106
"I have manually tested the changed functionalities and issues are taken care very well. Team has given justice to problem statement assigned to them, but with in the scope of issue assigned. Also taken care of edge cases. ",1206078,-1,8106
The code works well for edge cases as well. As they mentioned in the wiki sometimes the app throws an error (in English or SQL). It would be nice to know if they could debug a little and find out in which case the SQLException is thrown and in which case the English (handled) error is thrown.,1204524,1,8106
"Yes, after testing the work manually, I could see that their features are working as intended.",1207964,-1,8106
Code works.,1203899,-1,8106
I could get things working.,1203964,-1,8089
Manually tested the functionality of teammate review. Working as expected.,1207548,-1,8089
The features are working as expected in this project. The views have changed to fit the new implementation.,1206010,-1,8089
"Could not do the manual testing since the link mentioned did not work. But, the code seems good enough to work.",1208770,1,8106
"The deployed app on VCL doesnt work. Their testing plan on wiki is clear, although their app is not deployed / screencase is available, so not sure how to test the functionality.",1207243,1,8106
"The test for each functionality is written. However,I could find only 2 tests running , that too not with satisfactory results.",1203908,1,8106
the write-up provides adequate information along with before and after code which helps in better understanding of the issues and changes made,1208977,-1,8106
Team has written a professional and understandable writeup. Formatting is good. With good explanation of the approach taken to solve the issue. Creative way of writing before and after of the code snippet. Team could have added pictures to make it more relatable for users new with Expertiza.,1206068,-1,8106
"The writeup is clearly and adequately defined. It shows what the project is about, what all changes the team have made, all assumptions they have made and edge cases which they have ignored as they were out of the scope of the project.",1204514,-1,8106
"It is well written, quite understandable. It clearly and adequately indicates the working functionality. I can understand what the project is about.",1207954,-1,8106
Well explained. Add screenshot of the changes which can help understand the change visually.,1203886,-1,8106
Please add a guide in the wiki where to test if the features work or not. Initially found it difficult in the expertiza page where it has been modified.  The software works as expected in most cases. Was able to check the following  participant feedback displays author feedback view to whole team checking feedback assessment give feedback and edit feedback functionalities in the review view ,1206268,-1,8089
The writeup was written well enough to how and what the project does. The only suggestion is to include screenshots. That would make the write up even more easy to understand.,1208760,-1,8106
The method names and variable names are very well defined ! The best I have seen so far ! No clear explanation is given as to which files are edited for which reason. Only file names are stated along with changes made. Why the changes were made and what do those changes correct is not given.,1206612,1,8050
"Difficult to test and review the work one since there were no screenshots provided. I was not able to find an instance of a review which could be submitted as a team but not by individual members of the team. Some of the webpages crash after clicking on a particular assignment to view the review report. Suggestions: The team could explain steps to access the ""review view"", so that manual testing could be done. The team could create dummy assignments for testing. Maybe, adding screenshots would help in the process.",1208088,1,8089
"The document clearly explains what was the problem and what was the solution they proposed.They have also compared and contrasted with the previous solution which is good. They have talked about how different roles come into play with respect to security perspective and what the pros and cons of having/not having those roles. Comparing the code changes gave a clearer view of the code changes. One improvement could be in the 'background' part.  Taking it as it was: The majority of the project was related to solving issues regarding the deletion of Administrator and Instructor accounts. Administrator and Instructor are both account types that inherit behavior from User but are (1)handled and deleted in different codepaths. Furthermore, properties are used on a User that aren't on an Administrator, (2)such as team ids or course associations  (1) The different codepaths could have been shown to get a better view (atleast a screenshot, considering it wasnt within the problem scope) (2) Although, why these properties arent on Administrator is defined in the forthcoming sessions, it was little unclear while reading it. (It could have been quoted that 'as we will see it in the forthcoming sections')",1207233,1,8106
Couldn't log in to test the code as no credentials were provided anywhere.,1207164,-1,8089
The writeup is clear. It is easy to understand what the project does.   ,1205928,-1,8050
It works fine for the cases tested.,1204028,-1,8089
The project seems to be incomplete. The work done is also not properly mentioned in the writeup.,1203896,1,8106
Test cases are failing,1205221,1,8106
Write up is good. Great job. However I could find few points that if rectified would make it even better.  It would be good if the problem statement could list the issue (hyperlinks) that are being fixed. That would make it easier to navigate Instead of pasting screen shot for solution it would have been good if few words detailing approach would be put. Post that screen shot could be put.  ,1206760,1,8050
The test plan focusses on a particular scenario for the functionality to work and does not handle validations and edge cases,1208980,1,8106
"The write-up was splendid. All instructions were written thoroughly. I did not face any problem in understanding. Also, screenshots guided well",1203834,-1,8050
"Yes, test plan is complete enough also team has explained the test plan technology to used to achieve it. Good knowledge of Capybara testing. Team could have added test scenarios for each issue step by step rather than single lines.",1206071,-1,8106
"Write-up clearly explains with screenshots what is done. However, does not say how the changes have been implemented.",1205486,1,8050
"The test plan is missing in the wiki page. The content in this section could be the one suggested in the above comment, to just include all the test cases added and write a brief description about each.",1204517,1,8106
The Test Plan is not complete.,1207957,1,8106
"I think their introduction and issue sections clearly shows what functionality the work is related to, they also add some screenshots which help me understand what they have done. But I can not understand what is bookmark and what it is used for, I think it is difficult for someone like me who have not used bookmark to understand these with only a short description. If they can write something more about bookmarks it will be better. ",1205194,1,8050
Include the code snippet in the write up as well.,1203889,-1,8106
Test plan seems complete enough.,1208763,-1,8106
The test plan is not there.,1208751,1,8050
"Test plan is included in the Writeup section. They have explained about the basic test cases and how it is implemented. Edge cases, invalid inout values arent explained in the writeup.",1207236,1,8106
I can not see any test plan section in the writeup.,1203901,1,8106
They have included a test model video in which all the test are passing. It looks complete,1207093,-1,8050
Not completely clear,1205219,1,8106
"Yes. The test plan is present in the writeup. Also, the links to youtube videos for the demonstration was particularly helpful too.",1203857,-1,8050
The writeup explains how the changes are made but does not state about design patterns used and the code dose not show any use of patterns,1208978,1,8106
"The Test Plan was comprehensive. However, in the video they could have explained which screens and which methods they were testing instead of just showing some test cases pass on the screen.",1206615,1,8050
Written very well explained approach taken to solve the issue.. Along with what was the actual problem existed previously in the system and how team has given a thought process the fix the issue. No type of design pattern is involved.  ,1206069,-1,8106
"The authors concisely explain the work they did. As a suggestion, I would ask them to include the tests written in the wikipedia page as well. The idea is for any reader to understand 100% what all happened in the project, without looking at the code.",1204515,-1,8106
"The authors considered different pre-conditions, edge cases, invalid input values, and other possibilities and i clearly well written. Test Plan looks complete",1205931,-1,8050
"Yes, the writeup explains explains how the authors did their work and they have mentioned the steps behind each functionality. They have made an UML diagram as well.",1207955,-1,8106
Write clearly explains the changes done.,1203887,-1,8106
"  Yes they have a test section. The amount of coverage added for the new tests is great. Keep it up, however I would have liked that the authors added more negative cases as part of t heir unit tests.  I see mostly the +ve test cases being handled in the tests.   ",1206763,1,8050
  The team does explain how and what they did.,1208761,-1,8106
"The writeup includes their thinking methodology and why they arrived at that solution. 'Changes' under 'User Deletion' clearly explains what went wrong in the existing code and what should be added. One suggestion would be, instead of showing 'Before' and 'After', they could have leveraged Git s UI version of + , - in red and green to have shown the differences. But 'before after ' way worked too !",1207234,-1,8106
"Yes, I followed the youtube link to check the tests and they have tested the controllers. ",1203837,-1,8050
The writeup includes some of the work done.Although it looks a bit incomplete and does not convey much about the project.,1203898,1,8106
Testplen looks exhaustive and is explained well.,1205489,-1,8050
"They don't have Test Plan section, but they added some screenshots of the test result, I can see they have pretty good path coverage. But I can not know if they test edge cases or invalid input values without seeing their Test Plan.",1205197,-1,8050
The writeup is well written. But I feel there are some missing details about the project. The team could elaborate on the issues in the project and the solution that they have implemented. This way it would better in understanding how and why the authors did the work that they did.,1208749,-1,8050
It mentions what they did but doesn't highlight why they chose to implement that way. Don't seem to have implemented any design pattern as well.,1207091,1,8050
"The writeup expalins clearly enough what the authors did. Though, the part of ""Why"" the authors did what they did isn't elaborated with much depth. From the authors perspective, the articles seems exhaustive and comprehensive, but for a person reviewing the article, who doesn't have much background of the problem at hand, the article make it tough to decipher why certain program is written the way it is. ",1203855,1,8050
"The authors do not explain why they did the word the way they did. Entirely new pages have been created with no indication as to why those pages were needed . Old redundant code has been commented but not deleted. Naming and code pattern wise, very good job.",1206613,1,8050
"The write-up only tells what is to be done and how it is done. The rational behind choosing the approach is not mentioned, neither are any of the principles mentioned. It has comparisons between the previous and new versions and why they made they made the necessary modifications.",1205929,-1,8050
No. I think the authors should have mentioned why a particular solution was taken. What was the main driving force for taking the approach that they have taken. This was entirely missing. Pls work on that. They could also remove much of the commented code.        ,1206761,1,8050
"Yes, the problem statement was explained thoroughly. Also, the team very aptly described why the issue needs to be fixed. great work !",1203835,-1,8050
"Writeup does not mention anything about how the code works, alternative strategies possible or strategies they used.",1205487,1,8050
"I didn't find any information about how and why they did the work, they only show me what are the issues and the results after they fixed these issues, for example, in problem 2, they told me their is an average rating metric bug and they fixed the bug, but they said nothing about how they fixed the bug.",1205195,1,8050
"The explanation is quite good to tell what is the current and the required functionality. The screenshots placed are not complete, as in they cut the code at the right end. Instead I would suggest to placed the github link to the code changes, so that the wiki becomes shorter and you can explain each code change better in the wiki. Also, the reviewer can compare the code with your explanation properly if he has the link to the code.",1206342,1,8089
The write up is okay but could be a bit more descriptive. Could have provided screen shots of the changes to help reader understand better. No initial instructions on where to get started.,1208820,1,8089
No clear explanation is given as to which files are edited for which reason. Only file names are stated along with technical changes made. The method names and variable names are very well defined ! Kudos!,1208402,1,8089
Nicely written Wiki with screenshots describing some of the changes made.,1203954,-1,8089
Code snippets are provided but the functionality that was to be implemented and how has that been achieved is not explained.,1207538,1,8089
"This project is on implementing a single rejoinder per team for reviews instead of per participant reviews and also makes the feedback link for reviews more accessible. The writeup explained the background about Expertiza and the motivation for the project. It then moved on to list the tasks that were implemented and files that were modified in the project. It showed the current and new implementation clearly. The writeup, however, could have quoted the tests done using RSpec and the UI, instead of plainly mentioning the that the tests were modified to suit the current implementation.",1206000,1,8089
I was able to understand what the project does to a certain extent. The writeup could have been more eloborate with views/snapshots of the page before and after the changes.  It adequately indicated what functionality the work is related to.,1206258,1,8089
"The team has mentioned the problem statement and the methods which they have implemented to solve the problem.  However, there is a difficulty to follow the workflow since there are no screenshots attached or any video link provided. The team could improve this by adding a screenshot of the updated workflow below the changes shown in the writeup",1208078,1,8089
"Yes, the purpose of the project is clearly explained.",1207154,-1,8089
"The team has written a well structured write-up, but it lacks depth in certain areas. There is need for more background on what an author feedback is. The project description gives a better idea. Please try to include details from there. The last sentence under the 'Motivation' head, ""You should change this to list the teams collective feedback to its reviewers to a particular assignment"" is a bit confusing. Please rephrase the sentence so as to add clarity to it.    Instructions on how to manually test the functionality is missing. It was difficult to figure out how to navigate to and test the functionality. It would be really helpful to add this in the wiki.",1204018,1,8089
"There is a separate testing section in the writeup, but it does not have much explanation. Could have added a couple of test case explanations. Also, a screenshot of a passed test case could work wonders.",1206345,1,8089
Test plan not included.,1208823,1,8089
The authors have considered various preconditions but edge cases are not tested. No test plan has been provided. Some tests have been edited to meet the new requirements. Many conditions have been checked using 'if else' cases which could have been more elegant.,1208405,1,8089
Most of the edge cases seem to be covered.,1203957,-1,8089
Test plan missing.,1207541,1,8089
"The test plan section just states that the existing test cases for feedback per member is fixed to satisfy the new feedback per team implementation. It would have been effective if specific pre-conditions, edge cases, invalid input values etc are handled. For example, in this case the input with missing team id or one member teams can be used as good candidates to test the implementation.",1206003,1,8089
The test plan does not look complete. It just says Fixed the existing test cases for the review feedback by a team instead of a team member. Could have mentioned the edge cases and how they tested it.,1206261,1,8089
"Unfortunately, the write-up does not include a test plan. The team has included the following line in the ""Testing"" section: ""Fixed the existing test cases for the review feedback by a team instead of a team member."" The team could improve this by adding the test cases to maybe to check whether the ""get_feedback_assessment"" method returns the proper assessment using teamid or not or check whether the summary reports navigation redirects the user to the correct page or not.",1208081,-1,8089
Just a one-line summary has been provided about the testing but it is not clear what the test plan is.,1207157,1,8089
The authors have just mentioned that the test cases were updated. It would be good if the code diff for the test case modification were also provided so that we get an idea about the kind of changes made.,1204021,1,8089
"The writeup mentions about the changes done in the code but not how and why it was done. Instead, the team could explain each code change more and give a link to the code change(from github)",1206343,1,8089
They have provided code snippets explaining what they did. No design pattern used or specified.,1208821,1,8089
No mention is made as to why the changes were made in which specific files. A few lines are given before each image but they are too succinct to understand anything. The code is well written but hard to follow (what is the functionality of the code is tough to decipher). Code is well written.,1208403,1,8089
"No, the write-up doesn't describe why certain methods were chosen and written the way its implemented.",1203955,1,8089
The functionality provided as a result of each issue is not explained. The way of work or design principle is not mentioned.,1207539,1,8089
"The writeup clearly explains the project- a single rejoinder per team for reviews, but does not explicitly say the advantages of having such a system. On the other hand the authors do justify the need to fix navigation issues for giving feedback to reviewers as it results in a user-friendly UI. The modification to summary report to accommodate collective feedback is logical and directly implied if the main problem statement of single rejoinder per team is properly justified.",1206001,1,8089
Could have been more eloborate. No mention of design principles or patters used. ,1206259,1,8089
"The team has explicitly mentioned the classes and the name of the files where they have made changes. However, i would suggest the team to add the filenames above code snippets that they have attached in the write-up. This would make it easier for the reader to follow the workflow.",1208079,1,8089
"The classes where the changes have been done are mentioned. However, it is unclear as to why those classes have been changed and the real pattern behind picking those classes or methods.",1207155,1,8089
" The write-up has detailed how the author has done the changes. But it fails to address why the particular direction was taken, in some cases. It would be good to elucidate on that as well. In ' Solutions Implemented...' section, it would be good to include the names of the files before each code snippet and not just the description so that it is easier for the reader to relate.  ",1204019,1,8089
All of the cases discussed in the Test Plan have been included in the test file. And all of them are also passing. Very good!!,1206021,-1,8055
The tests have been properly converted into automated tests.,1204159,-1,8055
The test cases are covered in the coded.,1205615,-1,8055
They kept working on this test and improved it.,1205824,-1,8055
The names are very intuitive. The build doesn't seem to have been passed because of the indentation errors and failure to follow certain design guidelines.,1206019,-1,8055
"the code follows correct name structure for variables, methods and class.",1204157,-1,8055
All the names are used properly.,1205613,-1,8055
Code contribution of all team members. The code doesn not smell dry,1209017,-1,8055
"The test cases are cleanly written following good practices. Some of the indentation needs to be adjusted to contain better readability. Also, within the menu_rpec file, you are essentially testing two classes Node and Menu. I am not sure why that is. Is the node class and inner class of menu? Maybe these two classes should be separated into different rspec files to ensure a better naming setup. Maybe this could be clarified in the wiki so that readers would understand the design choice. Overall great work.",1203525,1,8055
"The code looks good. It seems well ordered, structured, and 'DRY'.",1206020,-1,8055
the function definition is of perfect size. the code follows the Ruby Style Guide.,1204158,-1,8055
"Most of the codes are well strutted, but something like ""returns an equivalent item"" is long and it is better to separate them.",1205614,1,8055
Yes.,1205827,-1,8055
No idea how to manually test the authors file.,1206022,-1,8055
all the tests are working properly except one. A pretty good work has been done.,1204160,1,8055
The tests all pass successfully.,1205616,-1,8055
Clearly.,1205817,-1,8055
The wiki document was very clear with respect to the responsibilities of the group. it also detailed their approach to writing the tests as well as explained the functionalities that the tests were written on. Well done!,1206012,-1,8055
The write up is perfectly written.It clearly describes what functionality the work is related to. It gives information for each aspect of the project.,1204150,-1,8055
"The team has introduced the functions clearly, but it may be better to also include the introduction of expertise itself. Besides, the motivation is general, add some specific details for this project would be better. As far as I am concerned, for the functionality of the menu, the introduction is also a little bit general. Adding more details about what the function of the menu, so we can know clearly what should be tested and if the test is enough.",1205606,1,8055
Test plan is well-rounded.,1205820,-1,8055
test cases are thorough,1208799,-1,8055
"The test plan is accurate and checks for different pre conditions , edge cases , invalid input values. I could not find any missed scenarios.",1204153,-1,8055
The test plan describes the flow of the tests and what the expected values of the objects should be in certain scenarios however I didn't find any mention of edge cases or invalid input values.,1206015,1,8055
"For the methods that include different conditions, they provided tests fo different kinds of conditions. Also, for each method, the team test various aspects of the method.",1205609,-1,8055
Well explained information about the Design and the results.,1209010,-1,8055
"The overall purpose of the project, the need for mocks/stubs, and the scenarios of each test case are very well presented; however, there is little explanation about why certain tests were implemented in any particular fashion. It would be a nice addition to include a few of your test cases and explain your reasoning behind why/how you implemented that test case. Adding this would further clarify your design/testing plan choices and make for a fantastic read.",1203518,1,8055
The write up is enough for me to understand.,1205818,-1,8055
The document explained well the work and the approach to doing the work.,1206013,-1,8055
The write up is clear with its goal. It nicely explains how and why did the author work in a particular way.  ,1204151,-1,8055

They are done with one of the Test Plan scenarios. Second one is yet to be done.,1208296,1,8107
Test cases are not part of requirement spec.,1204966,1,8107
Test plan is manual. No RSPEC files included. ,1209066,1,8107
No test cases is included in test plan.,1207266,1,8107
Testing plan didn't outline what the automated tests were or how it is done. The video showed the features being fixed. Also the hosted expertiza site was not working.,1204605,1,8107
No tests added,1207433,1,8107
Not many functions defined. Only database changes made and inbuilt function used.,1206325,1,8107
Pull request build passes well and there are no issues.,1208294,-1,8107
Please make sure code like puts X is avoided. Remove them and commit the code again. Builds are failing. See the Travis CI build details and code climate errors and fix them,1204964,1,8107

  Convert if nested inside else to elsif. Unused variable key inside remove_non_utf8 method.   ,1204965,1,8107
Follows ruby standard codes. Already implemented functions are changed and have stayed away from adding too many functionalities. ,1209065,-1,8107
Code had a few guideline misses which was noted and suggested by the automated tool on pull request.  ,1204604,1,8107
"1) No, function length is good 2) No. they are apt. 3) comments are not included, which makes it hard to follow, as the changes are not regarding functionality rather than system implementation, comments should have been elaborate and detailing why the change is done 4) Yes they did 5) No. the code was DRY and reused efficiently",1207432,1,8107

No there is no test plan included,1207427,1,8107
"The write up does not mention any patterns if used, and could not identify the pattern from the code as they have made changes using the database and not any function",1206319,1,8107
I understood the write-up pretty well. I also liked to way the fix was implemented,1203911,-1,8107

"Though they have detailed their approach on DRY, they haven't documented the core issue beyond non UTF-8 not accepted. Its hard to follow their scope as only review or entire expertiza use, as the table alteration is done as a whole",1207425,1,8107
All the cases discussed in the test plan have been implemented.,1207609,-1,8071
they have done all the 29 test case and test them throughly.,1206399,-1,8071
The team has tested all the methods of the corresponding model file.,1206109,-1,8071
Well done in achieving 100% test coverage and passing all the tests.,1204147,-1,8071

"Names for variables, classes, and method are properly named and make sense",1203588,-1,8071
The test coverage has increased significantly from like one test to 100%. Kudos to the team!! The team's pull request hasn't passed due to inconsistencies in following Ruby styling guidelines.,1206107,1,8071
Proper naming conventions are followed for variables and methods and classes. The only thing I think can be improved is dummy names for files and hyperlinks.,1203821,1,8071
"The code is DRY enough, and the functions seem to be compact.",1207608,-1,8071
"There are some duplicate codes could substitute with ""before"" statement. For example, line 100 are exactly the same with line 108, it is better to use ""before"" even if there is only one line duplicate.  ",1206398,1,8071
This was a testing project and the mocked objects were appropriate,1203589,-1,8071
The code is DRY. There is no redundancy in the code.,1206108,-1,8071
Overall the team has done good job in maintaining Ruby Style guide. The team could add more comments and reduce code redundancy in scores() method.,1204146,1,8071
All the codes are of perfect length. That is actually one of the best thing about the code. It follows basic ruby style guide.,1203822,-1,8071
Code climate issues that were reported have been fixed.,1208314,-1,8071
"I feel that they have achieved a 100% test coverage, although the design principles or patterns used haven't been listed. Listing that would help understand the testing strategy used.",1207601,1,8071

"For every tested method, they explain why they created certain objects or did what they did",1203582,-1,8071
The writeup explains well the plan of work of the authors and the way in which they approached the task at hand.,1206101,-1,8071
The authors mention that they have followed DRY Testing practices but there are few test cases where they have not  implemented it. For example scores(questions) method. I would recommend to make the use of factories. Overall well written test cases.  ,1204139,1,8071
"The writeup is really nicely written. It clearly mentions the work done. However, the problem statement could have been explained a little more.",1203815,1,8071

It's a testing project and the video provided show that all test pass and they have at least 90% coverage,1203591,-1,8071
The test cases are working. The coverage also as i can see is 100%.  I could find only one test for which the edge case failed.,1203824,1,8071
There is no Test Plan yet implemented in the wiki documentation. Be sure that when you include this section that you make the inclusions specific and intentional.,1203490,1,8124

The team has not included a Test plan that models their tasks for running the test cases. It should list the overall procedure adopted by the team from scratch to getting the tests running. ,1203141,1,8124
"I am unable to find the file review_response_map_spec in the github repo that was supplied. However, there was a ruby file that was attached in the submission. The variable names are also clear and unambiguous. This file is incomplete but the tests that are complete seem to follow appropriate syntax and guidelines. I would suggest to add some describe and context blocks that would clarify the purpose of each test case rather than just have the it statement saying the name of the method being tested. Keep working to finish up the remaining tests in this fashion and it would be great.",1203488,1,8124
hey variables follow all the stanard conventions that it needs to.,1207818,-1,8124
" in test file, you can give one more line of it, for each test to describe the purpose in a little more detail than just the method names.  ",1208065,1,8124
The functionality added to the pull request is reaonable and makes use of appropriate keywords. It could be improved by giving names according to convention like feed_ back_ review_response_map could just be feed_back as jt is part of the review response map model file.,1203139,1,8124
There are 7 issues pointed by the auto bot which require code to follow coding standard. ,1209052,1,8124
The code seems to set up a large list of factories only to then in many cases make these redundant by creating mocks for each test case. It is unclear what the code is trying to do and many of the test cases are large with many mocks with stubbed methods. It would be helpful if explanation for the code was given. When using factories it is generally unnecessary to stub the all the methods of these factories as they are in fact actual instances of the class. The code not very DRY. In many the cases the mocks and stubbed methods could be moved to a before_all or before_each block. ,1208946,1,8124
"Except the lack of comments in the code, the code seems to be perfectly fine. Could be improved in that scenario.",1207819,1,8124
"As mentioned in the above comment, Add these describe and context statements to further comment on the purpose of your test cases. This makes it easier to understand the why the test is there, I also find that it helps to clarify to the developer that the test is necessary.",1203489,1,8124
"For nil input test, they should separate them from the normal input with a new test, instead of put them in one. some missing invalid input testing, such as import, export methods.  ",1208066,1,8124
The code written by the team includes the basic functionality needed to run the test cases. Some improvements might include keeping a function short like diving the import function into multiple contexts or reducing reduntant code by using the mock built.,1203140,1,8124

"I believe the wiki is not complete. However, the content that is included so far does aid in the explanation of the project purpose. More elaboration and completion of additional sections such as the testing design and implementation of tests will help to fully clarify the project purpose to the reader.",1203481,1,8124
The team has not added any test cases.,1202492,1,8043
the code follows Ruby style guide. the code does not contain long methods. the variables and functions are properly named.,1202838,-1,8125
No new tests have been written,1204724,1,8043
"They may misunderstand the meaning of test plan, they just put the code on test plan, so i cannot judge weather they are success or fail.",1208901,1,8125
They have covered all cases which they mentioned in the Test Plan,1206223,-1,8125
 Not all i can see only some of the methods being covered 61% approx,1207326,1,8125
No test cases / Test plans,1207566,1,8043
"Unfortunately, the test cases are lacking This could be improved before the second submission",1208016,1,8043
"The Test Plan is not defined formally in the wiki. Instead the reader has to reason about the provided code itself. All of the tests are passing, but methods like 'review_response_report' and large part of 'import' are not covered.",1202688,1,8125
There is no test plan.,1204287,1,8125
"The writeup is sufficient in itself, but not as exhaustive or easy to understand from the perspective if an outsider. The author could have elaborated more on the problem statement, and how it related with expertiza. Also, instead of directly jumping to the implementation, the author could have explained a little bit more about why and what was the approach taken by the author.",1207811,1,8124
There is no Test plan.,1203875,1,8043
the writeup just simply explanin what is expertiza and the requirement for this program.,1205718,-1,8124

"Since it is a test project, their variables, methods and class names are reasonable and easily understand.",1208899,-1,8125
The Write Up can be improved by explaining all the Methods which are tested,1205498,1,8124
The wiki document for the project does not provide enough details about the project and the task performed by the team. It contains of only a rough overview of the project at this stage. It does not reveal much about the functionality of the program.,1203132,1,8124
All the variables and function names used are appropriate. ,1202490,-1,8043
"Regarding the writeup,  I told the changes which I felt needed above. The code looks comparatively neat. A clear video showing the test cases running will be appreciated.",1206221,-1,8125
Write-up provides all the necessary information needed to understand the project but a brief explanation about certain methods would have been better. ,1209045,-1,8124
There is not a specific Test Plan section in the wiki. There is a Work to be Done section that discusses the work that should be completed for project success. I would suggest rearranging or rename this section and continue to describe your plan of attack for testing.,1203484,1,8124
"The unit test cases were completely fine, and covered almost all of the code.",1207814,-1,8124
I cannot find the test plan.,1205721,1,8124
"There is a section titled Test Plan. However, it does not seem to be a plan or give an outline for the development of the code. Instead it describes what the methods do, but shows the testing code for the method. This is confusing as no explanations are given for the coding design.",1208941,1,8124
" It divides testing codes into parts, and described purpose of each chunk of code.  ",1208061,-1,8124
The writeup does not include the Test Plan section. It is suggested that the team add the section and include a number of different aspects such as specifying the edge cases and preconditions considered while working on the test cases.,1203135,1,8124
Briefly covered all the possibilities.,1209048,-1,8124
there is no explanation in the writeup.,1205719,1,8124
"As mentioned above, it lacks some depth in this.",1207812,-1,8124
"Little explanation for the code is given. The only case in which code is explained comes in the section titled Test Plan under the subsection Mock Instance. Here, it is mentioned that the project uses mocks to aid in testing functionality. However, the code example is actually of factories, a different but related concept. It is unclear if this is a typo or a misunderstanding because in later code snippets mocks do appear.",1208939,1,8124
 For testing I don't think there are any design related thing.  ,1208059,-1,8124
No team could have given some info on that,1205499,-1,8124
"The writeup lists the task to be performed under the Work to be Done section. It enlists the criteria required to be achieved as part of the project submission. The team can adopt a workflow that can give details about how the team managed to reach the current implementation such as understanding the files involved, steps taken for setting the expertiza environment etc.",1203133,1,8124
covered all the edge cases but have not provided any explanation. ,1209046,1,8124
"The variables, names are well assigned.",1208687,-1,8043
"There a large set of variables that do not follow typical ruby naming convention. An example is that ""existAssignment"" should be ""exit_assignment"". Additionally, some names are not very helpful. For instance, the variable ""frm"" is used for a form, but why not just use ""form""? There is also a lot of javascript written directly on the page and are difficult to read and understand as there is missing method names or other non-intuitive variable names",1208097,1,8043
"The code is clear and concise. The variable, method and class name choice is correct.  One variable i feel can be changed is  top_max_choosers can be renamed to topic_max_slots, as slots has been used in the function name as well and it will be more consisted  ",1204722,1,8043
 The coding syle is good well versed ,1207324,-1,8125
"There are some instances of variable names that are concatenated with numbers, for example answer2, questionnaire2 etc. While this approach can be justified in some cases, I would suggest using more descriptive names instead or arrays if multiple instances are required. For example team could be used instead of team1 because that is the only Team instance variable in the source code.",1202686,1,8125
I did not see pull request,1204285,1,8125
"For the Ruby changes they have made, they have used intuitive names and used naming conventions as much as possible. def update_feedback   Some places, the variable names are used in CamelCase whereas few places they werent used. Few variable names were directly used from legacy code, although refactoring could have been done. curquestionnaire quesparams . questArray",1207564,1,8043
The code does follow all the standards and steps to cover all the test cases. Could include some more comments to make the code self explanatory. ,1209041,1,8125
the code does follow the ruby style guide.,1202837,1,8125
"Their code is good, but some of them are too long.",1208900,1,8125
"Most of the variable names and function names are named based on proper convention. Suggestion: function addCreateTopicSection()This function name could be changed to maybe CreateTopic() or AddTopic()Apart form this, all other names look good",1208014,1,8043
The code is written neatly and follows the suggested guidelines.,1205530,-1,8125
The code is well written. DRY concepts are used.,1206222,-1,8125
" Test cases are effective, with minimal statements there is maximum coverage ",1207325,-1,8125
"All the variables are defined with respect to the functionality like - max_team_size, get_participants_without_team.",1203873,-1,8043
"The source code is mostly following standard Ruby practices, but there is a room for improvement. Firstly, the source contains large chunks of code blocks that are commented out. I would suggest removing those chunks as they reduce the overall readability. Given chunks can always be retrieved via commit history. Secondly, some application level objects like Answer or Criterion are used to create corresponding instances as opposed to mocks. It would be better if the authors either used mocks or provided the reasoning for this decision.",1202687,1,8125
The code looks good.,1204286,-1,8125
The code works fine for the listed functionalities. All the cases along with the edge cases are considered.  ,1209043,-1,8125
the basic test cases are test well.,1202839,-1,8125
"Yes, their code works pretty good, but their coverage is a big problem.",1208902,1,8125
Functions and variables are named aptly,1205449,-1,8043
"Code is nicely written and runs well. However, more edge cases should be included. For example, each function should be tested for a known success case and an edge case or potential failure.",1205532,1,8125
"Running the code manually resulted in 69.61% coverage. However, there are four methods that are in a pending state.",1202689,1,8125
The coverage could be higher.,1204288,1,8125
 The test cases work as expected and handles edge cases as well,1207327,-1,8125
The code works in the edge cases also for delete an other tests mentioned.,1206224,-1,8125
"The wiki looks too long with a lot of code. It does have all the code and test cases, but its better to have git links to each code and more explanation of the code used above it in the wiki. This will help the readers to compare the changes in the code with the explanation parallelly.",1209033,1,8125
No clear explanation for the work.,1202829,1,8125
"No, I don not think their writeup is clear. In their writeup, they just paste the code without any explanation. ",1208892,1,8125
"The wiki page is divided into some nice sections, however the authors have just included the code as it is without any description of the work that they have done.",1205522,1,8125
The write up is written adequately. Only thing is to reduce the code shown on the wiki page as I feel that it might be irrelevant to have the whole code increasing the reading page size.,1206214,1,8125
" Its a good write up, additionally you could try to explain method and test rather than including all the test cases ",1207317,1,8125
Ruby coding standard has been followed. Only one function has been added in controller as per requirement. Code follows DRY principle. The team can add comments for the code added which would be useful to understand the code.,1202491,1,8043
"This team used migrations effectively, and generally had DRY code, but it still felt very ad-hoc. I couldn't find any patterns that drove the changes they made.",1208098,1,8043
"The wiki defines the primary goal of the project but it does not contain a discussion about the plan or strategy that is utilized to solve the problem. Raw code is copied from review_response_map.rb and review_response_map_spec.rb files, however this does not give the reader any useful information.  I would suggest replacing the review_response_map.rb code with a short description of what the team needed to understand about the given code in order to write the test suite. Furthermore, the team can provide a listing of higher level method descriptions from review_response_map_spec.rb, what are the expectations and which mock objects are being used to achieve the result. One minor improvement would be removing parts like Expertiza description (http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/index.php/CSC/ECE_517_Fall_2018/E1850._Write_unit_tests_for_review_response_map.rb#Background) because it is redundant in this context.",1202679,1,8125
There should be more explanations.,1204278,1,8125
"def create function in assignments controller seems to be long and could have been refactored. Considering that they used most of the legacy code and most of their work was on UI, their part on ruby changes werent much ",1207565,-1,8043
"The team has written a concise and efficient code with proper implementation. However, some additional comments in some parts would improve the readability and make it easier to comprehend",1208015,1,8043
"Yes, the code has all the possible test cases. Many of the edge cases are covered and listed in the wiki.",1209036,-1,8125
The code is well structured. Could have added more comments for easy understanding of the code. The functions are not long.,1203874,1,8043
"Not perticular test plan section, but there are some different possible results have included.",1202832,1,8125
"In their test plan, most of it is code, without any explanation or cases.",1208895,1,8125
"As this rubric calls for the need of a section - Test Plan, I suggest adding it and including the work done in that section along with why a particular test has been written.",1205525,1,8125
" Most of the scenario is covered, the total coverage needs to increase a bit.",1207320,1,8125
"The Test Plan is not defined formally in the wiki. Instead the reader has to reason about the provided code itself. Given test suite covers every method of the object under test. ~70% Coverage is achieved. It would be better for the team to define the test plan and decouple it from the actual code. This could be done by firstly stating all the 'describe' constructs, methods that they are testing and secondly, elaborating by listing their descriptions.",1202682,1,8125
There is no test plan.,1204281,1,8125
"Functions are of appropriate length and code is in proper methods. However, no comments are provided what so ever.  ",1205450,1,8043
"The group has not shared the link for the test environment. Hence unable to test the edge cases. However, in the screen cast they have covered the functionalities mentioned in the requirement document.",1202493,1,8043
I have not been supplied with a link to manually use an instance with their changes and I have not been able to find a link in their PR or write-up.,1208100,1,8043
I could not run it locally and hence I am not sure about the edge cases. Code looks clean and should not break in most of the cases,1204725,-1,8043
"The youtube screenshare clearly shows the changes made and works perfectly. Since the edge cases arent defined, not sure about the functionalities of edge cases in this case as it involves UI most of the time",1207567,-1,8043
"There is no link provided to test the code manually. However from the video provided, I can infer that all the features have been implemented and are working properly. Issue #718 and #926 are working as expected. In issue #971, I could see that the previous version of the 'add new topic' page had a topic description and topic category field which is not seen in the updated version. Suggestion: The team could implement that or if already implemented, add that to the wiki page to reflect the way in which that is handled",1208017,1,8043
The features work as intended. Edge cases are properly executed.  ,1203876,-1,8043
The code works.,1205452,-1,8043
"No deployment is provided, so couldn't test manually. ",1205986,1,8043
"All the functionalities are listed and code also attached for the same. But, if the code changes were highlighted in color as in git, then its better comparable.",1209034,1,8125
the writeup does bot explain how and why the authors did the work the way they did.,1202830,-1,8125
"No, they explain nothing, just put the code on it.",1208893,1,8125
The wiki page is divided into some great sections that provide details about the project. I appreciate that the team provided actual code snipits along with explanation of the test to afford the reader a deeper understanding. The first paragraph in the design section is a bit hard to follow. It would be helpful to have this explanation accompanied by the tests these stubs were associated with and/or the actual implementation of these stubs for a better grasp of their purpose. I would recommend combining the test and design sections for a easier flow of reading and following test implementations. Thank you for the Results section of the wiki that wraps up the project and is an easy point of reference for the reader to see the outcome of the project. ,1203469,1,8046
Please explain your test work rather than just paste your code.,1205675,1,8125
The authors have not provided any explanation of the tests that they wrote.,1205523,1,8125
There could have been certain negative scenarios tested as well. ,1208115,1,8125
Writeup can be improved at the task section and more information could be added,1206215,1,8125
 Some cases yes but most cases it needs more documentation ,1207318,1,8125
The wiki does not include any discussions about design principles or patterns that were used in the project.  One thing that stands out in the code is that every mock object is defined at the start of the file. The team could provide a rationale for this decision and why it is superior to for example using different mocks for each separate test suite.,1202680,1,8125
There is no explanation.,1204279,1,8125
The write up addresses details of all the three problem statements along with the code changes done in every file and the files added. The team has also added screenshots of the manual testing and the video demonstrating the functionality they added.,1202483,-1,8043
"The write up covers all the issues and is well organized, including the code blocks and the screenshots.",1208680,-1,8043
"I was able to understand the changes they were making and why, however I thought the write-up was a little too verbose and had too much code - I can find the code in their PR.",1208090,1,8043
The Documentation is well written and indicated clearly what was the problem tackled and how it was approached and solved,1204715,-1,8043
"The writeup s format on how they distinguished the features and explained solutions for each and everything is good. First they give a bird's eye view of the problems and then deep diving into each problem with solution and screenshot is good. The background explanation given could have been more specific towards their problem statement, rather than just about expertiza. The images tend to occupy the entire page and its little difficult while going through it, a little foramatting could have made their page really good.",1207557,1,8043
"Yes, the team has clearly stated the problem statement and the changes they have done to provide solutions to the problem. They have been given 3 problems to which they have clearly provided the names of the files and the part of the code which is changed. The video explains the problem and the implemented solution perfectly without any ambiguity.",1208007,-1,8043
The write up clearly explains about the modifications made in Expertiza.  It indicates the functionality of their work which is topic management and the problem statement is clearly elaborated. It provides the files changed and also the code snippets in which the changes are made. The write up also provides visual representations of the changes made. ,1203866,-1,8043
"writeup is very well written, contains enough screenshots and explanations of the code.",1205442,-1,8043
The write-up is well explained but could have described more on the methods whey implemented and why did it implement in a certain way.,1205976,1,8043
The team has not included any test cases. It would be easy to include the test cases on the  app/controllers/suggestion_controller for the update_feedback method that has been added. Also the team may add some features test cases as most of the changes made are in html files. The team can refer the existing features present in the .spec/features folder.,1202486,1,8043
"There is no explicit test plan section, but all the scenarios are covered with appropriate images.",1208683,-1,8043
Text Plan is Missing,1204718,1,8043
There was no Test Plan,1207560,1,8043
"The writeup does not include the test plan as of now, but that is the only thing which is left for the team to complete. The team could work on this and try to improve the test coverage.",1208010,1,8043
There is no test plan.,1203869,1,8043
No test cases or test plan mentioned in the write-up.,1205979,1,8043
The team has explained the issue and the solution they chose with enough details to understand to way of implementation.,1202484,-1,8043
"They explained it well, but there were no larger design patterns they seemed to be following. I did think that they used AJAX in the appropriate way, but it could be improved in the future.",1208091,1,8043
"Their solutions are well explained. The way they have explained, attaching a screenshot of a code snippet and telling, this is where we made this change, and this is how it works, gives a better understanding of their project. It could have been better if they could have compare and contrasted the previous codes, where the features where not there. That way, the background of the why this feature could have been clear.",1207558,1,8043
"Yes, the team has explained their code and the reason for the additions made. However, for the issue #926, some more information about the Tablesorter and some additional comments would improve the writeup. Solutions to issue #718 and #971 are explained clearly and are easy to follow.",1208008,1,8043
Design patterns were not used. Rest of the code is explained and easy to follow.,1203867,1,8043
"Writeup explains what was to be done and how they did it, but does not give rationale behind the way they coded, and any alternative approaches.",1205443,1,8043
Code snippets are given but need explanation. ,1205977,1,8043
"The wiki for this project contains tons of useful information about testing and rspec. I am not sure that some of it needs to be explained to the current extent (example: what unit testing and TDD is or the environment set up). They are nice to include but maybe less as the purpose of the project is not to educate on those topics. Overall, this wiki did an outstanding job of describing the purpose of the project.",1203493,-1,8033
They have clearly state what the platform is and what they have tested.,1206472,-1,8033
"This wiki is the most comprehensive one I've come across. Right from the basics of Expertiza to unit testing to developing and explaining the test cases, everything has been done to perfection. Also, the result and the explaination for choosing the test case is provided, which is very much appreciated. ",1207576,-1,8033
"I think this team has done a nice job on the writeup of unit test, which contains every functionality of their work and is easy to understand.",1205742,-1,8033
"I felt the section ""conditions tested in menu"" could have been more verbose.",1208577,1,8033
 The writeup Problem Statement section is very clear about what their work related to.     ,1205872,-1,8033
"The wiki document coherently specifies the overall procedure adopted by the team for the project. From the page, it is seen that the team have given a general overview of the project scope and additional functionality and references used towards the working of the project. ",1202863,-1,8033
wonderful job with 100% coverage,1205730,-1,8033
Again the test plan is not about what they test in the Rspec test.,1206481,1,8033
All the tests passes with 100% test coverage. Great work!,1204227,-1,8033
They add a lot of tests but they did not mention which test they plan to do in the Test Plan section.,1205881,1,8033
The code follows the DRY principle and the Ruby style guide for writing the test cases. The code could be improved by providing comments. The code contains optimum length methods and the variables and functions have been properly named.,1202872,1,8033
"The team has worked well on changing magic numbers to reasonable variables. For example, 1 to item.  ",1204225,-1,8033
"Not sure what ca_test1 really is. I also didn't find an explanation in the write up for ""node""",1208584,1,8033
" All variables, methods and class names look reasonable.     ",1205879,-1,8033
"From the pull request, it is clear that the team wrote test cases for the menu model and achieved a 100% coverage that checks for most of the edge cases. The variables included the mock instance have been adequately used for testing the methods.",1202870,-1,8033
good job,1205737,-1,8033
"The code looks very clean. I am a big fan of the set up of the describe/context/it nesting that clearly defines the test cases' purpose. I am confused why there are two classes being tested in this spec. Is the purpose of this class to test Node or to test Menu? If two classes are being tested they should perhaps have separate rspec files to make clear the point. However, the actual syntax and implementation of your tests is beautiful.",1203501,1,8033
"The code is ""dry"" enough with some ""before"" statement to prevent duplicate codes.",1206480,-1,8033
code style is perfect,1205738,-1,8033
The code properly provides test cases for both the Menu class and the Node class(in the Message class). The code follows the DRY principle such that all the test cases use the variables and scenarios appropriately.,1202871,-1,8033
"There are some small problems like final newline missing, but overall looks good.     ",1205880,1,8033
"The tests describe the code they are testing not the behavior/functionality. Like for ""In this scenario, the controller_action attribute of the menu item is unavailable. In this case, the expectation is that a customized path is assigned to the URL variable."" This just specifies what variable is being updated and I have no idea what workflow it represents. This is at least a brittle description for a test. Suppose tomorrow the variable is removed or some function ends up calculating the value, while the test it self might pass if the change was passive, the description is now stale and will confuse any user trying to update the tests. ",1208585,1,8033
The Menu test case violates the DRY principle. The team can make use of factories to get rid of code redundancy. Overall good work!,1204226,1,8033
"Except for the lack of comments, the code was relatively easy to understand, and was sufficiently DRY. ",1207584,1,8033
 All the test passed.     ,1205882,-1,8033
Code is clean and variable names are readable. Need a bit of formatting as some lines are not 'aligned' well. ,1203842,1,8042
"Tested in the links given, the changes are working correct. The server is up and I was able to reflect the steps mentioned. ",1203844,-1,8042
"The write-up is very clear and directs user to the main issue very well. The flow is very structured, in the sense that first it gives a high level view of what expertiza is, it then tells about the book-mark functionality, and then tells the problem and how they came up with the solution. One of the most professional wiki I've reviewed.",1203854,-1,8042
"The writeup expalins clearly enough what the authors did. Though, the part of ""Why"" the authors did what they did isn't elaborated with much depth. From the authors perspective, the articles seems exhaustive and comprehensive, but for a person reviewing the article, who doesn't have much background of the problem at hand, the article make it tough to decipher why certain program is written the way it is. ",1203855,1,8042
"Yes. The test plan is present in the writeup. Also, the links to youtube videos for the demonstration was particularly helpful too.",1203857,-1,8042
"Yes. the variables have been very keenly named. Especially in the file, _rubric.html.erb, the variables are very accurately and effectively named, as there could have been much confusion otherwise. Kudos for that.",1203861,-1,8042
The code follows most of the standard practices except the 3rd one. It does falls short of comments. It took a very long time to make sense of what the changes made by the author in a particular file does. This scenario could be improved in the future iterations.,1203862,1,8042
All of the features mentioned by the author works successfully in the demonstration as well as in the manual tests performed by me.,1203864,-1,8042
The writeup is clear. It is easy to understand what the project does.   ,1205928,-1,8042
"The write-up only tells what is to be done and how it is done. The rational behind choosing the approach is not mentioned, neither are any of the principles mentioned. It has comparisons between the previous and new versions and why they made they made the necessary modifications.",1205929,-1,8042
"The authors considered different pre-conditions, edge cases, invalid input values, and other possibilities and i clearly well written. Test Plan looks complete",1205931,-1,8042
"The variables, methods and class names are aptly named. I could not find names which are not suggestive of functionality.",1205935,-1,8042
"Great work. Clearly Understandable. Functions are of appropriate length, Codes are in appropriate methods, Code is very well commented, Code follows ruby style guide. Good naming.  ",1205936,-1,8042
Good work on including test cases. The app works fine after testing.,1205937,-1,8042
Could not detect any flaws. Works exactly as it has been been in the wiki. Good guidance. ,1205938,-1,8042
"I didn't find any information about how and why they did the work, they only show me what are the issues and the results after they fixed these issues, for example, in problem 2, they told me their is an average rating metric bug and they fixed the bug, but they said nothing about how they fixed the bug.",1205195,1,8042
"I think their introduction and issue sections clearly shows what functionality the work is related to, they also add some screenshots which help me understand what they have done. But I can not understand what is bookmark and what it is used for, I think it is difficult for someone like me who have not used bookmark to understand these with only a short description. If they can write something more about bookmarks it will be better. ",1205194,1,8042
"They don't have Test Plan section, but they added some screenshots of the test result, I can see they have pretty good path coverage. But I can not know if they test edge cases or invalid input values without seeing their Test Plan.",1205197,1,8042
They did not have a Test Plan.,1205203,1,8042
"I can find where is the bookmarks page, but according to their screenshots I think their features work well.",1205204,1,8042
"Write-up clearly explains with screenshots what is done. However, does not say how the changes have been implemented.",1205486,1,8042
"Writeup does not mention anything about how the code works, alternative strategies possible or strategies they used.",1205487,1,8042
Testplen looks exhaustive and is explained well.,1205489,-1,8042
"Use of a few variables is hard to understand. For e.g. : x.assignment.id  Otherwise, most variables and classes are aptly named.",1205493,1,8042
" The code is well written, follows ruby guidelines and functions are of appropriate length.   No comments are provided what so ever, making the huge code change very difficult to follow.",1205494,1,8042
All the test plan is converted to automated testing.,1205495,-1,8042
Write up is good. Great job. However I could find few points that if rectified would make it even better.  It would be good if the problem statement could list the issue (hyperlinks) that are being fixed. That would make it easier to navigate Instead of pasting screen shot for solution it would have been good if few words detailing approach would be put. Post that screen shot could be put.  ,1206760,1,8042
No. I think the authors should have mentioned why a particular solution was taken. What was the main driving force for taking the approach that they have taken. This was entirely missing. Pls work on that. They could also remove much of the commented code.        ,1206761,1,8042
"  Yes they have a test section. The amount of coverage added for the new tests is great. Keep it up, however I would have liked that the authors added more negative cases as part of t heir unit tests.  I see mostly the +ve test cases being handled in the tests.   ",1206763,1,8042
"Build fails, pls look into it.  BookmarkRatingResponseMap has been replaced by BookmarkRatingQuestionnaire but the earlier naming convention just by looking at the name let the reader understand the data structure being used. I would have liked similar approach here.    ",1206767,1,8042
Function names look good. And most of them have len < 20 which is good.  The tests make use of contexts effectively. This is great to see.    Yes more comments are required especially in the controller code telling why an approach was taken and what the function does.   ,1206768,1,8042
Yes most of them but they have not added any automated integration tests. Unit testing has been done and is great to see such detailed tests,1206769,1,8042
"Yes.  I suggestion, since they deployed the code and video, it would have been good if they put a view of the UI usage similar to what they have put as screen shots in the code.   ",1206770,1,8042
The method names and variable names are very well defined ! The best I have seen so far ! No clear explanation is given as to which files are edited for which reason. Only file names are stated along with changes made. Why the changes were made and what do those changes correct is not given.,1206612,1,8042
"The authors do not explain why they did the word the way they did. Entirely new pages have been created with no indication as to why those pages were needed . Old redundant code has been commented but not deleted. Naming and code pattern wise, very good job.",1206613,1,8042
"The Test Plan was comprehensive. However, in the video they could have explained which screens and which methods they were testing instead of just showing some test cases pass on the screen.",1206615,1,8042
All methods and variables are suggestive of the functionality. Only some of the code changes are explained and reason of taking a particular problem solving approach is lacking. ,1206619,1,8042
More comments are needed because I had trouble following what the code was doing in some places. The code follows Ruby Style Guide and is DRY in its design. Functions are small in size and naming conventions have been followed. Good work in this area.,1206620,1,8042
The test cases have been developed into automated tests however edge cases or failing cases have not been considered. Only simple and straightforward scenarios have been tested. The video shows the test cases and the document shows the coverage. The document is well made.,1206621,1,8042
The features work as intended however I am having trouble navigating and checking what are the differences between the original system and the improved system. Could have made a demo video showing the improvements or a step guide to follow.,1206622,1,8042
The writeup seems apt. I had a little problem understanding the solution to problem 1 but otherwise it seems fine,1207090,1,8042
It mentions what they did but doesn't highlight why they chose to implement that way. Don't seem to have implemented any design pattern as well.,1207091,1,8042
They have included a test model video in which all the test are passing. It looks complete,1207093,-1,8042
Class and variables are name correctly. get_bookmark_rating_response_map is an not an apt name for a function. The word bookmark can be omitted in function and variable names inside the bookmark controller. .when a student requests a bookmark it should show a bookmark test is failing,1207097,1,8042
"Yes, it looks they have converted all the cases into the Test Plan.",1207099,-1,8042
Cases mentioned seem to be working fine. Can be a bit descriptive about the steps though.,1207100,1,8042
The write-ups been written well. A small suggestion to the team would be to explain their solutions in more detail as it would better the understanding of what the project does. Also the team could use code snippets instead of screenshots of the code.,1208748,1,8042
The test plan is not there.,1208751,1,8042
The writeup is well written. But I feel there are some missing details about the project. The team could elaborate on the issues in the project and the solution that they have implemented. This way it would better in understanding how and why the authors did the work that they did.,1208749,1,8042
The variable and method names are apt.,1208755,-1,8042
The code follows the DRY principle.,1208756,-1,8042
The test plan was not present. But the team have done a good job in implementing tests.,1208757,1,8042
They do work as intended.,1208758,-1,8042
There is no test plan included.,1208670,1,8082
All the cases are covered.,1208622,-1,8082
Testing isn't applicable to this assignment. ,1205127,-1,8082
No test plan added in writeup or explained otherwise.,1205463,1,8082
The authors have not converted test cases into automated tests. However manual testing has been shown in the vedio link attached,1204343,-1,8082
The tests scripts are not written for the changes.,1205838,1,8082
Testing is not covered.,1207382,1,8082
All provided variables are well assigned.,1208668,-1,8082
Good thing would be to increase the test coverage.,1206421,-1,8082
Variables and methods seemed intuitive enough,1208620,-1,8082
The coverage has decreased as per the tools that run by default on raising pull request by 13.6 %,1205125,1,8082
Build isn't passing. Write up isn't passable. No screenshots or explaination in write up of what you h=are doing and why.,1205461,1,8082
The pull request did not pass the tests and the names assigned seem appropriate to their functionality.,1204341,1,8082
"All the names are intuitive and reasonable apart from ""drop_topic_deadline1"". The team need to change this variable name to something more precise other than that Good job following naming conventions!",1205836,1,8082
Code looks good. Namings are also ok. Print statements are also pushed(not expected!).,1207380,1,8082
The functions added are not too long. This is the minimal amount of code that had to be added to implement the changes.,1208669,-1,8082
The commits show contribution by only 1 author. The code does not smell DRY.,1205274,-1,8082
There is no Test Plan yet implemented in the wiki documentation. Be sure that when you include this section that you make the inclusions specific and intentional.,1203490,1,8027
"As mentioned above, and also stated in the video and the pull request itself, the author has covered up everything.",1207820,-1,8027
I cannot find test plan.,1205727,1,8027
   ,1208067,-1,8027
The team has not included a Test plan that models their tasks for running the test cases. It should list the overall procedure adopted by the team from scratch to getting the tests running. ,1203141,1,8027
"I am unable to find the file review_response_map_spec in the github repo that was supplied. However, there was a ruby file that was attached in the submission. The variable names are also clear and unambiguous. This file is incomplete but the tests that are complete seem to follow appropriate syntax and guidelines. I would suggest to add some describe and context blocks that would clarify the purpose of each test case rather than just have the it statement saying the name of the method being tested. Keep working to finish up the remaining tests in this fashion and it would be great.",1203488,1,8027
hey variables follow all the stanard conventions that it needs to.,1207818,-1,8027
" in test file, you can give one more line of it, for each test to describe the purpose in a little more detail than just the method names.  ",1208065,1,8027
The functionality added to the pull request is reaonable and makes use of appropriate keywords. It could be improved by giving names according to convention like feed_ back_ review_response_map could just be feed_back as jt is part of the review response map model file.,1203139,1,8027
There are 7 issues pointed by the auto bot which require code to follow coding standard. ,1209052,1,8027
"As mentioned in the above comment, Add these describe and context statements to further comment on the purpose of your test cases. This makes it easier to understand the why the test is there, I also find that it helps to clarify to the developer that the test is necessary.",1203489,1,8027
"Except the lack of comments in the code, the code seems to be perfectly fine. Could be improved in that scenario.",1207819,1,8027
The code seems to set up a large list of factories only to then in many cases make these redundant by creating mocks for each test case. It is unclear what the code is trying to do and many of the test cases are large with many mocks with stubbed methods. It would be helpful if explanation for the code was given. When using factories it is generally unnecessary to stub the all the methods of these factories as they are in fact actual instances of the class. The code not very DRY. In many the cases the mocks and stubbed methods could be moved to a before_all or before_each block. ,1208946,1,8027
"For nil input test, they should separate them from the normal input with a new test, instead of put them in one. some missing invalid input testing, such as import, export methods.  ",1208066,1,8027
The code written by the team includes the basic functionality needed to run the test cases. Some improvements might include keeping a function short like diving the import function into multiple contexts or reducing reduntant code by using the mock built.,1203140,1,8027
Many tests are not yet implemented. More testing of the author's work in handling edge cases will be done in round two of reviews.,1203491,1,8027
Not possible to test work manually.,1207821,-1,8027
I cannot find the code,1205728,-1,8027
"Some edge cases are missing, so I assume most of them work.  ",1208068,1,8027
"Some functions have the same code deleted and added again which could've been avoided, like  schema.rb line 105 & 110, lines 741-743 & 745-747 and more lines similarly in that file",1205126,1,8082
Manually ran the Test and Coverage report says only 34% of Code is Covered,1205508,1,8027
In the code topic_id1 and @drop_topic_deadline1 name doesn't seems to follow the ruby guide line and you should probably name them differently like first_topic_id and first_drop_topic_deadline. ,1205462,1,8082
"The test cases given by the team work as described. The features are implemented accordingly. The edge cases are considered while designing the mocks. In general, all the code for test cases works as specified.",1203142,-1,8027
"The code is DRY however, certain sections of the code could be shortened further.",1204342,-1,8082
"Video seems fine, covers all the cases with 100% coverage.",1209055,-1,8027
"I believe the wiki is not complete. However, the content that is included so far does aid in the explanation of the project purpose. More elaboration and completion of additional sections such as the testing design and implementation of tests will help to fully clarify the project purpose to the reader.",1203481,1,8027
"The writeup is sufficient in itself, but not as exhaustive or easy to understand from the perspective if an outsider. The author could have elaborated more on the problem statement, and how it related with expertiza. Also, instead of directly jumping to the implementation, the author could have explained a little bit more about why and what was the approach taken by the author.",1207811,1,8027
the writeup just simply explanin what is expertiza and the requirement for this program.,1205718,1,8027
"none of the functions are too long could find changes where DRY principle was violated the code follows ruby convention and guidelines Although the code is easy to follow , the team needs to add comments for the changes which is currently missing. Good Job!",1205837,1,8082
"I can understand what the project does. I cannot, however, understand how the project does what it does. The code is not explained at all.",1208938,1,8027
More comments are needed.,1207381,-1,8082
 It has all the details about the testing for review_response_map class.  ,1208058,-1,8027
The Write Up can be improved by explaining all the Methods which are tested,1205498,1,8027
The wiki document for the project does not provide enough details about the project and the task performed by the team. It contains of only a rough overview of the project at this stage. It does not reveal much about the functionality of the program.,1203132,1,8027
Write-up provides all the necessary information needed to understand the project but a brief explanation about certain methods would have been better. ,1209045,1,8027
There is not a specific Test Plan section in the wiki. There is a Work to be Done section that discusses the work that should be completed for project success. I would suggest rearranging or rename this section and continue to describe your plan of attack for testing.,1203484,1,8027
"The unit test cases were completely fine, and covered almost all of the code.",1207814,-1,8027
I cannot find the test plan.,1205721,1,8027
"There is a section titled Test Plan. However, it does not seem to be a plan or give an outline for the development of the code. Instead it describes what the methods do, but shows the testing code for the method. This is confusing as no explanations are given for the coding design.",1208941,1,8027
" It divides testing codes into parts, and described purpose of each chunk of code.  ",1208061,-1,8027
everything seems to be working fine.,1206424,-1,8082
The writeup does not include the Test Plan section. It is suggested that the team add the section and include a number of different aspects such as specifying the edge cases and preconditions considered while working on the test cases.,1203135,1,8027
Briefly covered all the possibilities.,1209048,-1,8027
This section of the wiki is currently missing. When you write this section be sure to state why you tested certain cases in a particular fashion accompanied with code examples so that the reader can clearly see what was done.,1203482,1,8027
"As mentioned above, it lacks some depth in this.",1207812,1,8027
"Since the code is not deployed, manually testing cannot be performed. But, the screencast shows that all the manual testing is passed.",1208623,-1,8082
there is no explanation in the writeup.,1205719,1,8027
"Little explanation for the code is given. The only case in which code is explained comes in the section titled Test Plan under the subsection Mock Instance. Here, it is mentioned that the project uses mocks to aid in testing functionality. However, the code example is actually of factories, a different but related concept. It is unclear if this is a typo or a misunderstanding because in later code snippets mocks do appear.",1208939,1,8027
 For testing I don't think there are any design related thing.  ,1208059,1,8027
No team could have given some info on that,1205499,1,8027
From the video it seems it should work fine with the edge cases as well.,1205464,-1,8082
"The writeup lists the task to be performed under the Work to be Done section. It enlists the criteria required to be achieved as part of the project submission. The team can adopt a workflow that can give details about how the team managed to reach the current implementation such as understanding the files involved, steps taken for setting the expertiza environment etc.",1203133,1,8027
covered all the edge cases but have not provided any explanation. ,1209046,1,8027
Manual testing could not be performed as the link to the deployed application was not available however the vedio link attached sufficiently demonstrates how the features work.,1204344,-1,8082
all the scenarios including the corner cases are working fine. No issues or problems were found with the functionality. The only issue is related to the CI built which is failing at the moment. The team needs to analyse the root cause related to the build failure and fix it. Other than that it was a great team effort!  ,1205839,-1,8082
The information provided is good but the page is not organised and the code is confusing. Team should work on improving the format of content(the way they are representing info).,1208661,1,8082
The write up seems quite understandable. ,1206414,-1,8082
"The write up is well written and explain how and what is done in the project regarding all the issues.  Just one suggestion- it would have been great if the screenshots were uploaded corresponding to the changes made. But, otherwise the writeup is understandable. ",1208613,-1,8082
"Yes, the project is to do 2 things : 1. Stop teams from dropping assignments very late / close to deadline 2. Have different deadlines when assignments are done at different periods. The wiki should be created on expertiza page and not on wikipedia site.",1205118,-1,8082
"The code you have added in the write up isn't indented, its hard to understand this way. You need to make the write up more readable.",1205454,1,8082
The write-up is clear and clearly explains the issues corrected.,1204334,-1,8082
"The wiki is well written and contains all required information regarding the project. The screenshots can be included in the wiki and the code pasted in the documentation could be formatted. The team also need to inlcude the test plan section in the wiki. Apart from this , the team did a great work.   ",1205829,-1,8082
"Good, but lacks readability. The code is directly copy-pasted in the approach section. You could have used the pseudo code with proper explanations. The structure and formatting should be improved.",1207373,-1,8082
No test plan is included but it seems that team have covered all the scenarios properly.,1208664,-1,8082
The write up does not have a test plan.,1205269,-1,8082
Write up doesnt include test plan. Good thing would be include the testing steps they have performed. Few screenshots would be helpful as well.,1206417,1,8082
I found the test cases to be sufficient. No suggestion needed.,1208616,-1,8082
I don't think there's any testing involved in this assignment.,1205121,-1,8082
"Writeup doesn't has a test plan but in the video they have tested a lot. Also please add audio as well in your video explaining what you are doing and why so that its easy for the user to understand, otherwise watching 23 minutes silent videos is just to much.",1205457,-1,8082
No proper test plan has been mentioned yet in the write-up. But a link to demo vedio is available which includes the manual testing case.,1204337,-1,8082
Test Plan section is not maintained in the documentation,1205832,1,8082
Test plan section is missing.,1207376,-1,8082
"Writeup clearly explains why the team followed the particular approach and additionally mentions all the steps followed,thus defining the approach clearly.",1208662,-1,8082
"The writeup does talk about the changes and why the authors did it that way.   Rather than pasting the code (without any indentation) in the wiki page, the authors could have pasted screenshots of the code! This might have made it easier to comprehend.    ",1205267,-1,8082
"The writers have explained what they did in the project and how they did it. But, I could not find a 'why'. No reason behind the approach is specified.",1208614,1,8082
The readme was sufficient to explain details about the idea and also both the videos explain stepwise how this is achieved and demonstrates it. Also the bugs are fixed and droptopicdeadline has been integrated into the code of this assignment.,1205119,-1,8082
It's hard to understand the code you have changed from writeup. I saw the changes in your pull request it looks good to me.,1205455,-1,8082
Inadequate information,1202460,1,8082
The writeup mentions what lines of code were changed but it does not clearly specify what each changed portion of code means.,1204335,1,8082
The write-up contains the information about how the solution was achieved. The details about why the solution was implemented in this way is currently missing from the documentation. The team should include the same in the documentation as well.  ,1205830,1,8082
Not very comprehensive.,1207374,-1,8082
"Yes the tests are automated, also the command to run the test is given in the wiki.",1209042,-1,8088
the code follows Ruby style guide. the code does not contain long methods. the variables and functions are properly named.,1202838,-1,8088
"They may misunderstand the meaning of test plan, they just put the code on test plan, so i cannot judge weather they are success or fail.",1208901,1,8088
They have covered all cases which they mentioned in the Test Plan,1206223,-1,8088
 Not all i can see only some of the methods being covered 61% approx,1207326,1,8088

There is no test plan.,1204287,1,8088

"There are some instances of variable names that are concatenated with numbers, for example answer2, questionnaire2 etc. While this approach can be justified in some cases, I would suggest using more descriptive names instead or arrays if multiple instances are required.

I did not see pull request,1204285,1,8088

I would suggest removing those chunks as they reduce the overall readability. Given chunks can always be retrieved via commit history. Secondly, some application level objects like Answer or Criterion are used to create corresponding instances as opposed to mocks. It would be better if the authors either used mocks or provided the reasoning for this decision.",1202687,1,8088
The code looks good.,1204286,-1,8088

"Yes, their code works pretty good, but their coverage is a big problem.",1208902,1,8088
"Code is nicely written and runs well. However, more edge cases should be included. For example, each function should be tested for a known success case and an edge case or potential failure.",1205532,1,8088
The code works in the edge cases also for delete an other tests mentioned.,1206224,-1,8088
 The test cases work as expected and handles edge cases as well,1207327,-1,8088
"Running the code manually resulted in 69.61% coverage. However, there are four methods that are in a pending state.",1202689,1,8088
The coverage could be higher.,1204288,1,8088
"The wiki looks too long with a lot of code. It does have all the code and test cases, but its better to have git links to each code and more explanation of the code used above it in the wiki. This will help the readers to compare the changes in the code with the explanation parallelly.",1209033,1,8088
No clear explanation for the work.,1202829,1,8088
"No, I don not think their writeup is clear. In their writeup, they just paste the code without any explanation. ",1208892,1,8088
"The wiki page is divided into some nice sections, however the authors have just included the code as it is without any description of the work that they have done.",1205522,1,8088
The write up is written adequately. Only thing is to reduce the code shown on the wiki page as I feel that it might be irrelevant to have the whole code increasing the reading page size.,1206214,1,8088
" Its a good write up, additionally you could try to explain method and test rather than including all the test cases ",1207317,1,8088
"The wiki defines the primary goal of the project but it does not contain a discussion about the plan or strategy that is utilized to solve the problem. Raw code is copied from review_response_map.rb and review_response_map_spec.rb files, however this does not give the reader any useful information.  I would suggest replacing the review_response_map.rb code with a short description of what the team needed to understand about the given code in order to write the test suite. Furthermore, the team can provide a listing of higher level method descriptions from review_response_map_spec.rb, what are the expectations and which mock objects are being used to achieve the result. One minor improvement would be removing parts like Expertiza description (http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/index.php/CSC/ECE_517_Fall_2018/E1850._Write_unit_tests_for_review_response_map.rb#Background) because it is redundant in this context.",1202679,1,8088

"The Test Plan is not defined formally in the wiki. Instead the reader has to reason about the provided code itself. Given test suite covers every method of the object under test. ~70% Coverage is achieved. It would be better for the team to define the test plan and decouple it from the actual code. This could be done by firstly stating all the 'describe' constructs, methods that they are testing and secondly, elaborating by listing their descriptions.",1202682,1,8088

The wiki does not include any discussions about design principles or patterns that were used in the project.  One thing that stands out in the code is that every mock object is defined at the start of the file. The team could provide a rationale for this decision and why it is superior to for example using different mocks for each separate test suite.,1202680,1,8088

Moreover, the overall coverage shows a decrease of 0.1% which should be a cause worth looking into. But one must say that the details in the code changes have been to a good extent for the majority of the part and thus worth the merit. One thing that surely catches the eye is variable naming, especially 'handle_dups' which is a strange/ amateurish way of variable nomenclature and there is reason to believe that it may result into conflict in code at some point. ",1206607,1,8039

The write up is well made!,1205790,-1,8087
Wiki page is clearly and neatly written. I could understand what the project does. Writeup also has code snippets which has been modified.,1204526,-1,8087
The writeup is good and it clearly meantions the issues to be fixed in the problem statement and the code modified is also displayed.,1203457,-1,8087
Write up is easy to understand and follow.,1208378,-1,8087
Problem is well defined but the authors have listed 3 issues that need to be fixed but they have only provided 2 links in the problem statement. It will be nice if they can give the link to the third as well.   ,1206692,1,8087
no test plan availble in the documentation.,1206237,1,8087
no test plans mentioned,1206369,1,8087
"The Writeup does not have a test plan. Not able to check if they considered different pre-conditions, edge cases, invalid input values, and other possibilities",1204529,1,8087
No test plan required I suppose.,1208381,-1,8087
No the writeup does not mention the test section. ,1206695,1,8087
The 'why' part is missing for the code changes. What does each code line of change do? Maybe you'll can incorporate that.,1205791,1,8087
"The writeup was fairly specific on how the solution was implemented, although more qualitative description should have replaced the source code dumps. The writeup barely explained why the improvements were needed, focusing on what was implemented. ",1207852,1,8087
 The writeup explains to a limited extent the approach that was followed.Majority of the writeup consists of code and not how it was implemented.,1206235,1,8087
 they explained how they made the changes. Patterns if used are not noticed by looking at the code and not mentioned in the writeup,1206367,1,8087
Yes the writeup explains how and why the did the modifications. It has comparisons between the previous and new versions and why they made they made the necessary modifications.  There was no mention of using design principles or patterns.,1204527,1,8087
Yes the writeup mentions why the authors did the work the way they did it by clearly posting screenshots of the code modifications done by them.,1203458,-1,8087
"More of what is done is explained. Also, steps to manually test the instance could have been included.",1208379,1,8087
"Yes authors have an details about code changes that they have done and why they have done. I would have liked more emphasis on ""why"" ",1206693,1,8087
"Yes, the team has efficiently detailed all the details about the projects and the need for their changes to providing code of their changes. They have also attached coverage and test run screen shots for references.",1202987,-1,8108
They team has thought through efficiently to use design options that avoid test reruns and to dry out some mocks settings,1202988,-1,8108
"Yes they have come up with all possible inputs, edge cases and wrong data entries to check the system behaviour is not faulty",1202990,-1,8108
Yes there is no unreasonable function names and all method name are suggestive and apt,1202994,-1,8108
"1) No all functions are reasonably long if not too short. 2) No all methods seem about right 3) no but the team could have provided some comments in the score test function, as multiple expects are included 4) The code follows ruby guidelines and they used factories efficiently 5) Yes the code is DRY, they have used after each method to achieve it",1202995,1,8108
yes they have automated test and all of them pass,1202996,-1,8108
yes all the test written passes. They could have written a test to check if self[:handle] is returned if no nil parameter is sent,1202997,1,8108
The wiki clearly defines the primary objective of the project and justifies the reasoning behind introduction of additional helper constructs like participant factory. The authors complement the descriptions of each test case with associated block of code and elaborate on the details of their inner workings. I would suggest removing parts like high level descriptions of Expertiza and Unit Tests (http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/index.php/OSS_E1852.rb#Unit_Test_Description) because they are redundant in this context.,1203724,-1,8108
"The authors mostly focus on how they did what they did, i.e. inner workings of each test suite. Little to no discussion is provided on the overall decisions pertaining to design principles and patterns that have been utilized in this project. For example, there are no instances of before(:each) blocks in the source code. This decision could be discussed and clarified in the wiki page.",1203725,1,8108
The test plan is comprehensive and fully covers all the methods and cases that are part of the object under test. Running the test suite yields 100% overall coverage.,1203727,-1,8108
"Most of the source code is following standard Ruby practices. However, some cases could be improved. There is a number of variable names that are concatenated with numbers for example user1, user2 etc. While this approach can be justified in some cases, I would suggest using more descriptive names instead or arrays if multiple instances are required. Moreover, indentation needs to be fixed to improve code readability.",1203731,1,8108
The code is mostly clear and easy to follow. Test blocks are succinct and contain one assertion per block. One exception is the #score method. It could be improved by decomposition. The code for set up could be extracted into a separate before(:each) block and multiple 'it' statements could be used for testing expectations.,1203732,1,8108
Every test case that is provided on the wiki page is part of the automated test suite. There are no cases of failing tests.,1203733,-1,8108
Running the code manually resulted in the 100% coverage of the object under test.,1203734,-1,8108
"Yes, it is easy understand that it is a testing project and how it is done.",1204422,-1,8108
It explains clearly what tests are missing and how the coverage is increased.,1204423,-1,8108
The plan looks good and it covers a lot of cases.,1204425,-1,8108
Didn't find any pull request. Code coverage has increased as more tests are written and it is one of the required outcomes. Wiki states that 100% coverage is achieved and the same is demonstrated in the video link provided.,1204429,1,8108
All the code is in a single file as it tests a single model and it seems to cover it extensively. It also looks like there's no DRY issues.,1204430,-1,8108
Yes and it all passes too.,1204431,-1,8108

"Testing is done manually and there is mention of automated tests in the wiki but no files are seen. It's better to provide all links like github code, testing videos and wiki while submitting on expertiza.  ",1204599,1,8081
No there is no test plan included,1207427,1,8081
"The write up does not mention any patterns if used, and could not identify the pattern from the code as they have made changes using the database and not any function",1206319,1,8081
I understood the write-up pretty well. I also liked to way the fix was implemented,1203911,-1,8081
"Yes, the writeup explains explains how the authors did their work and they have mentioned the steps behind each functionality. They have not used any design principles or patterns. ",1208288,-1,8081
The folders/binary files in the drive cannot be played. Can you upload the video on YouTube so that it is easy for everyone?,1204958,1,8081
"Yes, it does explain but could have added more details to make it clear. ",1209058,1,8081
"Yes, team has explained why they worked in certain way.",1207258,-1,8081
"It explains their approach and issues they encountered like latin format, storing html tags and how they fixed it.",1204597,-1,8081
"Though they have detailed their approach on DRY, they haven't documented the core issue beyond non UTF-8 not accepted. Its hard to follow their scope as only review or entire expertiza use, as the table alteration is done as a whole",1207425,1,8081
"The testing of initialize is very well described with descriptions of how and why the tests were written in that particular fashion. However, all other tests are not discussed. When looking at the github it seems that there were many more tests that were not elaborated upon. The test descriptions were included at the bottom of the page but without explanation of implementation or purpose. It would be helpful to include more of the test cases. If anything, it would be a good idea to discuss them without the code inclusion like that of initialize because that section of the wiki is very well presented.",1203470,1,8046
"There is no Test Plan section at this time. However, the authors did include some discussion of edge cases and the fact that the initialize function required testing of known success case and potential failure. I think that this is sufficient without the inclusion of a Test Plan section. I would suggest that since this rubric calls for the section to just rearrange the content of your current page. Also, include the additional edge cases that you have already tested for in the other functions possibly with some specific examples. This will allow for a more thorough Test Plan section.",1203472,-1,8046
"Variable names and test cases are name appropriately. Test cases context, describe, and it statements are clear as to the division and purpose.",1203476,-1,8046
The code is written very neat and follows suggest guidelines. Authors have done a great job with the DRY principle and bringing out statements that would have been otherwise repetitive in the test cases.,1203477,-1,8046
"The authors seem to have considered most edge cases and pre-conditions. The section isn't explicitly named 'Test Plan', but the necessary content is there.",1203123,-1,8046
Everything is described clearly and the functionality added is easy to understand.,1203120,-1,8046
"All code is formatted well and neatly, with clear functionality.",1203128,-1,8046
All tests designed were to be automated.,1203129,-1,8046
Nothing to manually test. ,1203130,-1,8046
The write-up is descriptive and shows code from the _spec file paired with explanation.,1204162,-1,8046
The pseudo-code test plan does a good job of explaining the functionality of the tests without being clogged up by implementation details. I do suggest putting it closer to the top of the wiki page though.,1204165,-1,8046
"All tests pass, and 100% coverage was attained.",1204171,-1,8046
"Very nicely written document with test-plan which explains each test case , why it is written and what it tests n simple English language.",1204969,-1,8046
"This doesn't apply here much as its just writing testcases. However some of the tests documented in Menu like Mean with role and without role are confusing. I had to look through the entire doc to figure out why is that written that way. It could be better to have comments as to why a particular test is written , what does it test and why is the expected output the way it is.",1204970,1,8046
very nicely articulated description of all 29  testcases.,1204972,-1,8046
"Does not apply much.But instead of using names like temp and temp 1, a more significant name which is self explanatory of its content will be useful.",1204976,1,8046
Rspec code looks good.Proper comments and good variable name usage are 2 things i will suggest to improve. Very good work overall.,1204977,-1,8046
"Yes , all 29 test cases have been automated. The youtube video describes it perfectly",1204978,-1,8046
The tests run successfully even when cloned and run in development environment on VCL.,1204979,-1,8046
Tried to cover maximum test cases and explained well in the document with the coverage and video,1205754,-1,8046
The write-up explains the tasks adequately enough for a user to understand the expected outcome. ,1208716,-1,8046
They have explained the tests that needed to be implemented to verify the working of the functionality. ,1208717,-1,8046
"The test plan looks complete enough, they have covered most of the cases. The test coverage has increased a little bit.",1208719,-1,8046
"The write up is very clear, methods and test case are explained in a neat way",1207305,-1,8046
 The procedure and intention for writing the test cases is clearly mentioned,1207306,-1,8046
 All the scenarios are covered. Even the branch cases,1207308,-1,8046
All of the above 5 criteria are met.,1207313,-1,8046
Yes most of the edge cases is checked.,1207315,-1,8046
"The writeup has documented all the changes they have done, but could have been more elaborative on the exact functionality of menu.rb. ",1207349,-1,8046
They could have also documented their design approach if any and also use  of mocks and stubs. Their test intentions could have been more detailed,1207350,1,8046
"There could have been other tests with different inputs tried on the setup, initialize and select methods. the pre-conditions could have been more eloborate.",1207352,1,8046
"No, all method names and describe provided are apt and to the point",1207356,-1,8046
"1) No, they have modularized well. 2) No 3) They could have provided more comments on tests where they set nodes at few places. 4) They could have used factories more extensively, due to various mock data they might have needed to cover different inputs 5) Their code can be more DRY, as they seem to repeat instantiations in all places",1207357,1,8046
yes and all cases pass,1207358,-1,8046
Their tests are very straight-forward and can be extended to test few edge cases,1207359,-1,8046
Authors explain the test destination vividly.,1208196,-1,8046
Yes.,1208197,-1,8046
"The whole wiki page is complete and neat, while it might be easier to understand if they reorder the test plan with other parts of the page.",1208199,1,8046
All variable names are reasonable and easy to understand.,1208203,-1,8046
Neat code and well established form of the test.,1208204,-1,8046
Yes.,1208205,-1,8046
Test plan looks very generic.,1206517,-1,8066
Test plan is given a appreciable thought and team has also implemented test scenarios mainly in student_task_controller_spec.rb Would suggest team to try and increase test coverage.,1206169,-1,8066
Good work on including test cases.,1203109,-1,8066
Though the authors have included a thorough testing plan Inside the commits I couldn't find any commits for adding testing files. they could have added basic UI testing using Capybara and cucumber.,1207473,1,8066
Both the specs fails spec/controllers/student_task_controller_spec.rb fails spec/features/airbrake_expection_errors_feature_tests_spec.rb  ,1203811,1,8066

Link to the pull request is missing. Please add it.,1203107,1,8066
"The variables, methods, and class names do seem to follow proper convention and are suggestive of the functionality they are being used for. In some cases they could have used a liitle more desciptive names for variables for example inside app/helpers/student_task_helper.rb  they could have used background_colour instead of rtn as a variable name in the due_date_color() method. It will become more readable for the reviewers to understand the functionalities.",1207471,1,8066
"@all_task vs @student_tasks    The name 'all_task' does not sound appropriate. It should be student_all_tasks.   1. all_tasks => student_all_tasks   2. student_tasks => student_available_tasks   3. current_student_tasks => student_current_tasks 4. past_student_tasks => student_past_tasks     Also, the filename will_paginate_array_fix.rb seems misleading to me. A better name would have been support_array_pagination.rb.   Also, I am not sure this file should be in the initializers, as it is just a require statement. May be this should be included in the places where the pagination is required, instead of loading it during app initialization.       ",1203809,1,8066
"No pull request has been created as I can see from the link provided. The commits have been made, though. I think they are just one step behind creating a PR. Some variables like, @students_teamed_with, seemed ambiguous as to what do they represent.",1204912,1,8066
"The variables, methods and classnames are aptly named. I could not find names which are not suggestive of functionaliy.",1205405,1,8066
The code changes are well organized and nothing is out of place.,1208792,-1,8066
Pull request not created / link to pull request is not found in this submission.,1206516,1,8066
I could see commit performed by only single team member. 1. Functions are not too long or repeatative. 2. No code needs to be extracted as a new function. 3. Yes team need to add more comments. 4. Team does follow Ruby style guide. 5. Team understood rails and followed DRY principle well.  ,1206168,-1,8066
In due_date_color switch case would have been a better approach then if else if block. Lots of code that is done in view can be moved to the controller. Follow MVC architecture. ,1203108,1,8066
 The functions seem to be implemented in a good manner and the code seems to be DRY.. In some cases though the authors could have improved as in the i app/helpers/student_task_helper.rb  file. In side the due_date_color method they could have used case expressions in Ruby instead of the if else logic implemented as that would be a more Ruby on Rails way of doing it. As it will reduce the lines of code as well as being a more elegant way of handling it.,1207472,1,8066
"In the due_date_color(due_date), instead of hardcoding the color vs interval, it would have been more useful if those are pulled from a config file. That will make the implementation more flexible   Similar hardcoding found in  1. list_student_tasks: per_page: 10 2. breaking_word_wrap: breaking_word_wrap(student_task.assignment.name,40 )     Use of inline CSS element, could have avoided by using a simple css class. Such harcoded stuffs make the view strongly coupled with the style elements, which could have been avoided. <hr style=""height:2px;border:none;color:#e3e3e3;background-color:#e3e3e3;""   Also, the UI changes are not showing up properly aligned. Please see the attached screenshot  ",1203810,1,8066

The code works as it should.,1205408,-1,8066
Whether the task is due is determined by a date str and it may be go wrong under different timezone.,1208029,1,8066
Thee writeup page is concise and easy to understand but there is no insight into the code.,1208784,1,8066
Screenshots are missing under Test Plan section.,1206508,1,8066
Writeup is readable and written properly. Team could have added code snippet and pictures of changed or improved functionality. Also team could work upon formatting and could also add links and references.,1206160,1,8066
"Please include the code snippet that was changed and also a screenshot of the view before and after the change.  Also, Please provide the link to the pull request and not the repo created. Good written explanation of the changes done in WIKI.",1203100,1,8066
The wiki documentation has been updated. All the information has been documented in a neat and logical manner. The write up adequately provides what functionality the work is related to. The project changes to the code have been described in paragraphs which could have been better if they could have updated with code snippets and screen shots of the tasks at hand.,1207464,-1,8066
"Wiki has been well written, with enough clarity and description",1203802,-1,8066
It is clear what the project does and why it does it.,1204905,-1,8066
The writeup is clear. It is easy to understand what the project does. It would be better if you can put in more code details and major pieces that do the important logic.,1205398,-1,8066
The writeup is pretty clear.,1204290,-1,8066
"The test plan section is present, and it is covering all the scenarios.",1208787,-1,8066
"Wiki page does talk about test plan. But it is explained in brief, but no details of test scenarios or testing technology to be used.  ",1206163,1,8066
Few test cases are missing context and it block so it is difficult to understand what the test case is doing unless you read the entire code.,1203103,1,8066
They seem to have included a testing plan have mentioned it in their report. They seem to have considered edge cases and other possibilities.,1207467,-1,8066
"I could think of 1 missing test case, where an assignment due date changes from future to past, that assignment should now appear in the past assignment section,   apart from this test case, all edge cases have been covered.",1203805,1,8066
"Not much has been explained about the test plan. The authors have, however, explained how they will be going about the testing in general. An overview is provided which is clear to understand.",1204908,-1,8066
"It feels like test plan only covers one aspect - ""changing of the background color for tasks as we approach the deadline.""   here are other aspects which can be automated for testing, perhaps by Rspec or the likes:  Add past due assignments to the students task list (on Student View). -- Verify if they are being added/saved Check for correction in due dates of assignments (when an assignments due date is edited, it should be appropriately moved from the Past assignments list to the Current Assignments list if needed) --- Check if the functionality works.

The writeup explains everything regarding why and how the steps were carried out.,1208785,-1,8066
"Yes, Writeup explains the approach taken by team to solve the issue, theoretically. Team could have explained the issues and resolution practically. Also no design pattern or principle were used.",1206161,1,8066
It only explains how they did but not why they did. The various approach could have been mentioned in the WIKI.,1203101,1,8066
The authors have documented the steps they did to solve the issues. Although they haven't mentioned any particular design principles or design thinking that went on in solving the issues. They should have  explained all the functionalities of each file they have modified and stated why they have modified the particular file. One thing they could have added were class diagrams and dependency maps. Or some pictorial representation of the flow of each task which will help the reviewers and instructors to quickly catch up on their idea.,1207465,1,8066
"Wiki has been well written, with enough clarity and description",1203803,-1,8066
They have explained how they have implemented each task by adding/editing files.,1204906,-1,8066
"The writeup only tells what is to be done and how it is done. The rational behind choosing the approach is not mentioned, neither are any of the principles mentioned.",1205399,1,8066

The team has created a new spec file to test all the issues of the PR.,1205431,-1,8090
"Yes, the cases discussed have been converted into appropriate tests. ",1208817,-1,8090
Cannot check. Link ,1202456,1,8090
Adequate testing was performed using RSpec tests for both the issues.,1204355,-1,8090
They have converted the test cases mentioned in the test plan into automated tests. The tests have been implemented as mentioned in the write-up.  ,1208634,-1,8090
"The team has made minimal changes in the code to fix the issues. No new class, function or variable has been added.",1205429,-1,8090

No automated tests. But the fix seems to be working fine as per the test plan provided.,1209106,-1,8090
No issues found.,1208155,-1,8090
The newly added code adheres to ruby programming standards.,1202598,-1,8090
Test plan is clear but doesn't have any test cases.,1209104,1,8090
The names used seem appropriate to their intended functionality.,1204353,-1,8090
"The variables, methods and class names are named appropriately. The variables used in the program suggest the functionality.",1208632,-1,8090
There are no additions in terms of methods or any new implementation. There are minuscule changes done so it still follows the existing standard. ,1205430,-1,8090
There were not many big changes. All the changes are crisp and to the point.,1208156,-1,8090
The team has done well not to over complicate the issues and have resolved them with relatively few additions.,1202599,-1,8090
Functions are named properly.,1209105,1,8090
The code follows Ruby style Guidelines and is DRY.,1204354,-1,8090
"The functions are not too long so the code doesn't have to be extracted into separate methods. More comments could have been added for easy understanding of the code. The code follows the Ruby style guide and the code looks refactored, statements ""unless"" keyword are written in a single line.",1208633,1,8090
The code resolves all the issues as per the problem statement and the features work correctly.,1205432,-1,8090
It works as expected.,1208158,-1,8090
"I was able to create a new user with the username ""abc def"". Although the changes made to the code seem to be sufficient to fix this, the deployment does not seem to reflect the changes.",1202601,1,8090
Seems to be working.,1209107,-1,8090
Wiki or read me does not include instructor or student credential so couldn't check anything.,1206034,1,8090
The features for the issues fixed work as intended.,1204356,-1,8090
The author's work is implemented well and is implemented as expected. Few edge cases can be written to test the code completely.,1208635,1,8090
The team has explained the problem statement as well as the approach they has chosen with lot of details. It makes it very easy for end user to understand details of the project.  ,1205422,-1,8090
"Yes, I was able to understand the issue as well as the solution overall. But I couldn't understand why there is a need to append a team name to an assignment. It was just mentioned that it is done in other part of the code as well. Mentioning that would have given me a better idea.",1208148,1,8090
"The write up has been written well. There's obviously some additions possible to the write up. The code changes/additions have been shown, I would recommend description of why those changes/additions were made. I would also suggest the team to standardize the size of their screenshots. ",1202591,1,8090
Write up is clearly understandable. Systematic approach taken to fix the issue.,1209097,-1,8090
Write up is quite impressive. I was able to understand the project through write up.,1206024,-1,8090
The write-up is good and clearly mentions the issues to be corrected.,1204346,-1,8090
The problem is explained clearly and the implementation plan is also described elaborately. The explanation helps in understanding the project very well.  ,1208625,-1,8090
The team has included test plan as well as the screenshot of the manual testing.,1205425,-1,8090
"While the test plan for fixing team names have been shown, i couldn't find the test plan for validating username.",1208151,1,8090
Test plan has been well implemented for one of the issues. The test plan does not show what happens if a user tries to create a new account with a space in the username. ,1202594,1,8090
Write up has test plan with clear steps and screenshots.,1209100,-1,8090
They have covered few edge cases. Just a suggestion to include result before and after fixing the issue. May be juxtapose it.,1206027,-1,8090
"Yes, the project deals with an issue related to names, such as not allowing whitespaces , etc. The test verify that the issues are now solved.",1208811,-1,8090
The test plan looks good. It includes both manual testing and automated testing by writing Rspec tests.,1204349,-1,8090
"The test plan is explained in a good manner, but the edge cases and invalid values are not mentioned. What if a space is in front of the username. ",1208628,1,8090
Yes the team has done great job in the write up It is properly indexed and addresses details about each issue and its solution.,1205423,-1,8090
"The how part is clear. As to the why part, thought they have clearly mentioned the the problem statement, i think a little bit more of an explanation could go into why is that actually a problem.",1208149,1,8090
"How has been shown well through the screenshots but why has not yet been described. No particular reference to a design pattern has been made, but that is understandable since their project was based more on changes and less on additions to the code.",1202592,1,8090
Write up explains about the problem and how it needs to be fixed which seemed logical,1209098,-1,8090
They standardized the team name generation and fixed the username without space. For design patterns I think they didn't used it may be it wasn't needed,1206025,-1,8090
No write-up available rn,1202448,-1,8090
The write-up clearly mentions the issues to be fixed and the code changed to fix each issue.,1204347,-1,8090
The write-up explains the approach used and the code used for implementation very clearly. The test plan is also defined extensively. Screenshots help in understanding the implementation more. They did not use any design patterns. ,1208626,-1,8090
The writeup does not have a test plan or any related info on why it is not covered.,1202940,1,8094
"No,test plan has not been implemented but I don't think a test plan is required for their functionalities/",1207175,1,8094
Could not see test plan as well as automated test cases are not included Team could work upon adding test cases to test the functionalities. That would make the issue resolution more robust.,1205787,1,8094

Methods are not too long and each function is performed in the appropriate method,1206552,-1,8094
1. Functions and logic are written properly without long functions and dead or messy code. 2. No . Team has provide good modularization. No need to extract code further into more functions. 3. Code was understandable and easy to understand. 4. Code does follow ruby style guidelines. 5. Code and packages follow DRY principle. ,1205786,-1,8094
Code seemed to follow the ruby style guide,1208712,-1,8094
none of the functions are too long   could find changes where DRY principle was violated   the code follows ruby convention and guidelines   comments were included wherever necessary. the code is easy to follow.   Good Job!,1204941,-1,8094
The code is nicely written 3 More comments needed 5 Not DRY in one place (rubric array definition)   Suggestion:   1. Simply define a getRubricArray function to return the rubric array wherever required.,1203307,1,8094
The code is well written. The function length is also well within the required bounds. Comments adequately convey the info about the functionality that is implemented. ,1205904,-1,8094
No information on two other issues that need to be covered.,1202941,1,8094
They have not provided a link for the deployed so cannot test anything but they have provided a video and according to that everything seems to be working,1207176,-1,8094
Not deployed but the video provided which includes the demonstration of the fix.,1206554,-1,8094
"1. Clicking on action from manage menu correctly opens the corresponding tab.    Clicking on any manage sub menu action, correctly loads the corresponding rubric. 2. Whenever is rubric is changes, user is being asked for confirmation.    On conformation from user, corresponding  review response is deleted and email is being sent to user.    When user declined the confirmation, rubric is set back to original one. 3. Issue#1173 does not seem to be resolved.",1205788,1,8094
The manual testing done in the screencast seems fine. The features work correctly,1208714,-1,8094
The team has only fixed one issue related to selection of questionnaires according to the video. The other part of the problem statement is missing. The application could not be tested as the application is not deployed. ,1204943,1,8094
"After manual testing, issue 1 seems to be fixed and reflects the changes properly. Nothing seems to be done to fix issues 2 and 3 of the problem statement. Suggestion: 1. You can include any approach or design of functions to resolve remaining 2 issues in the writeup",1203309,1,8094
"The code has not been deployed. But according to the video, the workflow has been demonstrated properly. Out of the 3 issues, 2 have been resolved. One is not done. ",1205906,1,8094
" The Fixes Required part has been explained well with the cause of the issues. But, more light could be shed on what the formative and summative rubrics are. ",1202931,1,8094
Everything is explained in detail,1207166,-1,8094
Issues explained properly and change as well. The modifications are demonstrated using screenshots which helps in better understanding.,1206544,-1,8094
Writeup is written well. Understandable and clean explanation. Team has explained the problem statement and issues well with good amount of pictures. Team can improve on formatting.,1205778,1,8094
The writeup was written well enough to understand. Screenshots were also attached along with the steps making the documentation better. Can definitely understand what project does and how it is done.,1208704,1,8094
"The wiki is well written and contains all required information for issue 1. The documentation for other issues still needs to be included. Apart from this , the team did a great work.   ",1204933,1,8094
"The writeup is lucid enough to explain the details of the issue and how the system works after fixing it. Suggestion: 1. The authors can add a section on testing, explaining about how the issue fix can be tested. 2. They can improve the readability by mentioning issue numbers (from document issued by the prof.) on the write-up. It will save time of the reader to go through the document and map which issue has been fixed.",1203299,1,8094
The write up is clear and concise. The details about the functionalities are adequately explained. ,1205896,1,8094
The writeup does not have a test plan.,1202934,1,8094
Test plan not included,1207169,1,8094
No test plan,1206547,1,8094
"  I could not see any test plan. Team could work on writing test plan and implementing the same for the issues resolved. Also where team is failing to implement some functionality, as future scope, they can try design the solution and also test cases for the same,",1205781,1,8094
The test plan seems to be complete enough. No additional pre-conditions and edge cases are required.,1208707,-1,8094
The test plan column is missing from the documentation,1204936,1,8094
No. there is no test plan section included,1203302,1,8094
I did not find any test plan in the documentation.,1205899,1,8094
 Issue 1 under solutions tab is actually the third point discussed in the Fixes Required.It could be discussed as Issue 3 rather Issue 1 for better clarity. Only the solution for one issue is discussed. (?) The discussed solution is again well-defined with adequate screenshots. ,1202932,-1,8094
What and how explained well but they explain the why behind their actions a bit more.,1207167,1,8094
"Writeup is written well. No design principle or pattern involved, But the approach taken is explained in detail, step by step.   Team could add references and links.  ",1205779,1,8094
"Yes, the writeup seemed to include everything that was required. Code was also attached along with the screenshots and steps.",1208705,1,8094
The write-up contains the information about how the solution was achieved. The details about why the solution was implemented in this way is currently missing from the documentation. The team should include the same in the documentation as well.  ,1204934,1,8094
"The writeup explains the problem statement well, but fails to explain the approach and just have pasted their code. It also fails to have a reasoning behind the approach they chose. Suggestion: 1. The author can describe how they came up with an approach starting from analyzing the issue. This will remarkably improve the writeup. 2. The author can talk about atleast one more approach to fix the solution and explain why they chose a particular approach for implementation.  ",1203300,1,8094
The implementation details have been mentioned in the writeup clearly. Information about what every function does has been explained in an eloquent manner. ,1205897,1,8094
"As mentioned earlier, they have not considered testing at all at this point and hence, we are assuming that they are to implement testing at a further point in the project. Of course, mentioning an approach to the testing framework and how they would be going about it would have helped.   ",1206633,1,8117
One test case visible. ,1208959,-1,8117
No Test plan included in the submission.,1206893,1,8117
"No tests were added. No test plan too. So, difficult to interpret",1206315,1,8117
No tests have been discussed in the test plan.,1206157,1,8117
"They have not provided a descriptive test plan, however they have added rspec test cases for their code changes",1203443,1,8117
Couldn't see any testing being done.,1207222,1,8117
yes the functionality still holds good.,1206973,-1,8117
The Test plan is not a part of the writeup. The team can improve upon this by following the general guidelines of writing the document. The test cases can be coherently designed following the Better Specs documentation. The team must have the test cases designed that span the required goals.,1208111,1,8117
"Their methods name is too long such as ""#copy_questionnaire_details and #assign_instructor_id':",1208996,1,8117
"Not only does the build fail with multiple errors, the overall coverage is shows a significant decrease instead of an increase which is a real cause of concern. Moreover, the number of commits even though impressive does include a lot of minimalistic changes which one does beg to question the necessity of. But that's still fine since, I am assuming that the complexity of the code may require so many commits. But still adding a line break as a commit? I am unsure if its a great way to go about it. ",1206631,1,8117
Decreased to 12%. ,1208957,-1,8117
The test coverage on the contrary decreased,1206313,-1,8117
The names are intuitive.,1206155,-1,8117
"The variable names look fine, methods names are also meaningful.",1203441,-1,8117
I feel that the writeup was incomplete and none of the code changes made have been explained. It is difficult to see what approach they took.,1207220,1,8117
 All the names and methods look reasonable but some of the function size is still long.,1206971,1,8117
"The variables, methods and class names used do not justify the features performed and do not implement the desired functionality expected. Also, the code added does not improve the coverage of the files. The team should look towards using appropriate names and provide desired code segments to get a high coverage.",1208109,1,8117
They did not offer any link to code of their project.,1208997,1,8117
"1. Some Functions are of huge length and adequately structured with respect to the purpose in question, but I am assuming the complexity of the question requires so.  2. All code has been suitably well put into the methods with their intended function and work cutout for them.  3. No, the comments have been well placed and but are very strange and vague at some places suggesting an amateur approach.  4. The code does follow the ruby style guidelines and is thorough in that regard.  5. Nope, all code is somewhat consistent and vaguely to the point. ",1206632,-1,8117
Not really clear. Lines have been changed. No specific functions. But it shows good coding skills.,1208958,-1,8117
The project's purpose is to refactor the code. Hence the code has been separated into different files for better understanding.,1206892,-1,8117
I can see a file changed and the code in it looks to follow the concepts which needs to be followed,1206314,-1,8117
The code follows Ruby standards and DRY principle.,1206156,-1,8117
"The functionalities relating to Questionnaire have been moved to Questionnaire from QuizQuestionnaire which is very helpful. Suggestion: 1. You can try to create sub functions for code inside create and view, as they are really long functions",1203442,1,8117
The code seemed ok to me.,1207221,-1,8117
" (1)Functions are still long, save choice and save quizes are the top two, consider increasing more internal methods",1206972,1,8117
The code contributed does not follow the test rule in that the tests are made using create instead of build. The code functions do not implement much function and does not follow the Ruby style guide. The team should focus on getting the tests running by following the DRY principle. ,1208110,1,8117
Not possible to test as no way of testing has been given at all. No procedure to be even followed has been mentioned in the poorly constructed Wiki page. All that is possible is to try to infer whatever is possible through the pull request in which I have reason to believe as suggested by the code tester that multiple files are failing in the build stage itself. ,1206634,1,8117
The functionality does work. Some errors are visible as shown by Git. ,1208960,-1,8117
Cant really know what exactly is completed.,1206316,-1,8117
"No link to the deployed application is provided. Hence, cannot be tested manually.",1206158,1,8117
Cannot test the work as application link is not provided. They have not provided a screencast for working code,1203444,1,8117
 Some of the common edge cases work as per expected ,1206974,-1,8117
Couldn't test manually as no information regarding the steps to take to test is provided.,1207223,1,8117
Upon manually testing the author's work it is noticed that the functionalities have not been implemented to the full. The team did perform migration of the CRUD functionality for the Questionnaires from QuestionnairesController and removed large patches of if-case statements by placing it in the helper function in the apt model. This however has reduced their coverage.,1208112,1,8117
"No, their writeup is neither clear or adequate, which just contains a few lines without any explanation or introduction to the project. So i think their writeup is terrible.",1208989,1,8117
The write up does not show any detailed explanation of the project. ,1208950,1,8117
"No, the team has not been diligent in specially making a section of ""what it does"" as the introductory section of the doc so as to make us understand the goals of the project. They have just copy pasted the problem statement on the wiki page in a single paragraph. Even, that statement seems to have been incompletely pasted in just a single paragraph. So, it highly unclear what they are doing. I had to open the projects assignment doc of the professor to try to make sense out of the motivation of the problem.  ",1206624,1,8117
I think they have simply copied the text from the requirements document presented by the professor. The page is not well documented,1206306,1,8117
The writeup can be improved to begin with a short description of the project backgound so that anyone reading the writeup can understand what the project is all about.,1206148,1,8117
They don not have a test plan,1208992,1,8117
"Unfortunately, no mention of the word ""test plan"" has even taken place in their whole Wiki page. So, it seems that they are yet to implement the testing functionalities in their project. Although, it would have been better if they had checked if the checks or the tests already existed in the first place in the git repository.    ",1206627,1,8117
No test plans has been explained. But the Git repo shows one test successful. ,1208953,1,8117
There is no mention about their Test Plan. The section has not been included in the wiki page as well.,1206887,1,8117
Writeup doesn't conatin the test plan section.,1206151,1,8117
Couldn't find any test plan.,1207216,1,8117
"No, there is no test plan included in the review",1203437,1,8117
The writeup does not have the Test Plan section. They need to include it by specifying the section that describes the pre conditions considered by the team while working on the refactor review on the different question types from the uiz feature. ,1208105,1,8117
No they did not mention any design principles or patterns in their writeup.,1208990,1,8117
No explanation is given. ,1208951,1,8117
"No, the write up is a simple copy paste of sir's doc on the wiki page which half-heartedly states the problem statement in question. Also, what or how they have worked and approached the solution is not even mentioned. Difficult to follow any flow. ",1206625,1,8117
There is no mention about what work they did. The wiki page hasn't been properly formatted and the information is not adequate.,1206885,1,8117
It does not show any code or any thing related to the work they did,1206307,1,8117
The writeup should be written in a emore elaborative way clearly stating at the minimum - the problem statement; new implementation strategy; design principles; test plan and references.,1206149,1,8117
"The writeup states correctly the changes performed, but fails to provide a reasoning behind every change. Suggestion: You can include reasons behind choosing an approach, for atleast one refactoring code change",1203435,1,8117
"It was difficult at first to understand why they are doing what they are doing. I feel that the information is right there, it just needs better elaboration and description.",1207214,1,8117
"Not completely its lacking lot of informations, consider writing the code before and after the changes to explain the changes done",1206965,1,8117
The team needs to provide a list of sections including the test plan and unit test cases that would make it easy to refer to the pull request and the github code. They must also work on designing the wiki page making it easy to read and understand it.,1208103,1,8117
The writeup gives a high level overview of the work done Suggestion: 1. You can try to make the write-up more illustrative by discussing which refactoring principles were implemented in which files and how does it make a difference. 2. You can take help of code snippets to make it more understandable.,1203434,1,8117
Good description. I think with the use of headings and subcategories it will look good also need lot of conteent to mention the changes done,1206964,1,8117
The write-up is pretty ambiguous and feels all cluttered up. Maybe elaborating on few lines and separating the one whole paragraph into bullet points under different headings would have made it more readable and clear.,1207213,1,8117
The writeup is disorganized and does not specify the function carried out by the team during the project.  It does not follow the typical format of the writeup and provides a list of items such as files involved and task expected.,1208102,1,8117
"Although no specific test plans have been mentioned, the wiki page does show screenshots of the changes that are visible after logging in.",1207509,1,8109
"It does not seem to be an automated test plan. There are screenshots placed, which seems to be manual testing done.",1208181,1,8109
I could not see any mention of test cases in the wiki or github. Team could add/mention test cases surrounding the change that lead to checking the changes in this merge.,1204764,1,8109
They were not required to write automated tests as far as I know,1206291,-1,8109
There are no test cases,1206529,1,8109
"Testing for the UI changes has not been done. Maybe they were not supposed to, but if they were, more documentation in the wiki would be helpful.",1204511,1,8109
"No they haven't added. But i think its not required for this project, as its just UI change.",1205571,1,8109
The newly added code does adhere common HTML standards. The only other change is to the db schema.,1207507,-1,8109
"There is a change in the colour code required, so there was not much of a naming convention to be followed here. Dint find any instances in the attached code where name could be changed. One instance of is_submitted could be changed to is_submitted?",1208179,1,8109
"Variable, methods and class names seems as per coding standards and variable  names are making it easy to understand the logic code. Hence names used are reasonable. ",1204762,-1,8109
The only change this team had to do was add color codes for the various types of links that come up while reviewing. This would be hard to mess up.  And the team has not messed it up. Good Job guys.,1204509,-1,8109
In-line CSS style tags inserted instead of linking external CSS file.,1206527,1,8109
The naming looks fine in html file. Although your pull request shows changes in schema.rb file which i don't think you have used any where or had to make changes int it. Probably is went through by default when you pushed your changes. You might want to revert that from the pull request. That way I think your build will also pass.,1205569,1,8109
The build seems to have failed due to some unknown reasons. Travis CI states something unrelated to tests or something about dependencies that I can't quite comprehend. The names are quite comprehensible and the code was written well.,1207288,1,8109
 The color combination could be changed for buttons. Maybe for someone who has a difficulty while differentiating colors (me) faces a lot of problem.,1206289,1,8109
The added code is easy to understand and not complex.,1207508,-1,8109
Code does follow the conventions. Just that the comments could be better explained for the functionallity,1208180,1,8109
"1. Code is simple and written efficiently without long functions, unnecessary looping or dead code. 2. Shown snippet itself is well modularized and no need to be written as separate methods 3. Code is well understandable. 4. Code does follow ruby style guide. 5. Code follows DRY principle.  ",1204763,1,8109
"The code added is extremely easy to read, follow and understand.",1204510,-1,8109
repeated style tags,1206528,-1,8109
Looks good.,1205570,-1,8109
"The code follows Ruby guidelines. However, since the project involved just adding colour to certain links there was no point of the code being DRY. In fact, reviewing this project doesn't make sense since the project was literally just changing 3 lines of code, NOT THAT IT IS THE FAULT OF THE TEAM.",1207289,-1,8109
 The code is complete and does what it was intended to do.,1206290,-1,8109
The implemented solutions work in the deployment,1207510,-1,8109
There are just the changes in the button colours required which are working as expected.,1208182,-1,8109
Yes. Team has resolve the issue very well and also taken care of edge cases.,1204765,-1,8109
The changes in this project were simple enough to work for all edge cases.,1204512,-1,8109
Looks great.,1205572,-1,8109
"I couldn't login to the deployed website since there were no credentials which I could use. Perhaps the wiki page should have included the credentials for logging into the deployed website. However, from the screenshots it seems that the functionality works.",1207291,1,8109
 The page is complete. Only thing which I mentioned is a good color combination is needed.,1206292,1,8109
Writeup is written very neatly and in elaborated fashion with understandable images. Team could have added Github Expertiza link and pull request link at the bottom of the wiki page. Also references and credits.,1204755,1,8109
"The write up has not been formatted well, most of it consists of what can already be read from the OSS assignment specifications document. I would strongly suggest the team to include screenshots of their commits instead of using wiki code formatting.",1207500,1,8109
"The write up is well documented. There is a clear flow from the code change part to the screenshots of the implementation. It would have been better if there was a screenshot of the code from git or a link to git so that the code changes would have been more defined as per the green and red colour. Also, the code change could be explained more.",1208172,1,8109
"Yes. The team clearly indicates in the wiki, what this project is related to and how they went about to complete the given task at hand. I'm not sure about this, but maybe the heading for the wiki is incorrect. This project is listed as E1828 in the list of OSS projects. But the team have named it as E1785. This may be a mistake on the team's part, if so, I would suggest them to correct it.",1204502,-1,8109
 The code block runs out of the space. Needs to be corrected for proper look.,1206282,1,8109
"The document is well described with details on Expertiza, its purpose. It also details the files related to their assignment.",1207281,-1,8109
Explained very well.,1205562,-1,8109
"Looking at the commits, there is hardly any work done by the team other than adding style tags in 2 commits.Also, the wiki link attached is of Fall 2018. New Wiki has not been created.",1206520,1,8109
There is no scope of a test plan with changes made to the view.,1207503,-1,8109
There is no explicit test plan mentioned in the wiki. But for this project I don't believe one was needed.,1204505,-1,8109
"The writeup doesn't has a test plan, but the work they have done is on UI i.e. colouring the links. So there won't be any edge cases as such to fail in this project.",1205565,-1,8109
 They dont have a test plan in their write up but they showed the screenshots for various cases.,1206285,1,8109
"There is no separate test plan section, but the test functionality has been shown in the form of screenshots. Could add it under the Testing header in the document so that the code and test would be separeated.",1208175,1,8109
"Project does not have test cases included, hence can not check further functionalities. If team is not able to add test cases for exact change, team could add/mention test cases surrounding the change that lead to checking the changes in this merge.",1204758,1,8109
They have explained the changes they have done and why they have done them. ,1205563,-1,8109
The project was to change the colour of certain links to depict certain statuses. Since the complexity of the project was not high there was no scope to use any design principles or patterns.,1207282,-1,8109
 The write up explains each and every thing which they implemented,1206283,-1,8109
"Team has used in-style tags to add CSS styling in HTML pages. They instead need to create an external CSS, define the styling there and use the class names in HTML tags. This provides styling maintainability throughout application.",1206521,1,8109
"The writeup clearly explain why the team did the work that they did. Good job on that. The only thing I may have preffered to have as a reviwer is a detailed step by step instruction on how to view the changes made by the team in the app. This could be added in the wiki, or a short screencast could me made to help follow the steps.",1204503,1,8109
"The code change seems simple enough that does not require any design principle or patterns. Whatever the code changes are, explained properly and coding principles with required output.",1204756,-1,8109
"Yes, the code change along with the screenshots does explain the ordeal, but the git screenshots and some more explanation would be well appreciated.",1208173,1,8109
"The write up does intend to capture the changes that have been made, there isn't much for them to explain and thus the writeup seems short. There isn't much scope for the team to have used design patterns in a project which involved making cosmetic changes to the views.",1207501,-1,8109
The problem being addressed by this project is defined cogently without any ambiguities. Test cases are considered separately starting with description of the given method followed by how the functionality is being tested. I would suggest removing parts like Expertiza description (http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/index.php/User_talk:Rshakya#Expertiza) and rationale behind using Rspec (http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/index.php/User_talk:Rshakya#Unit_Testing_with_RSpec) because those parts fall out of the scope of this topic.,1202667,1,8040
"Authors describe the strategy they utilized for tackling the project and the detailed mechanics of each test case. However, there is no mention of specific design decisions or patterns that were used in the implementation. My suggestion is for the team to elaborate on technical decisions made for simplifying test cases for example the majority of mock objects is created at the beginning before every 'it' statement.",1202668,1,8040
"Scenarios that are discussed in the wiki have comprehensive descriptions and justifications. However, clearly a number of edge cases are not considered as the test coverage is ~77%.   I would suggest using mock objects which will both decouple tests from database and increase the overall coverage.  For example mocking find_by method of TeamsUser would allow covering participant#team case: allow(TeamsUser).to receive(:find_by).with(user: student).and_return(team)   Another minor issue is that wiki is missing some cases that are implemented in the code (#team, #fullname, #scores).",1202670,1,8040
"Most of the naming is reasonable and follows standard Ruby practices.  One problem is that code makes extensive use of variable names concatenated with numbers. Example: allow(participant3).to receive(:topic).and_return(topic) Here it is not clear what distinguishes participant3 from other participants and why it is special. It would be better to avoid using contractions such as stu1 or p1 (.sort_by_name method, Line 130). Furthermore, I would suggest using consistent indentation (for example .get_authorization method, Line 113).",1202674,1,8040
"The code is concise and readable. It consists of mostly small methods that test one thing. One exception is #.sort_by_name method where several assertions are made in one method. It would be better to use several 'it' statements and DRY out the code by utilizing before(:each) statement. One further suggestion would be to shorten the code by using one array statements instead of individual expressions. For example replace: stu1 = build(:student, name: ""Student1"") stu2 = build(:student, name: ""Student2"")   stu3 = build(:student, name: ""Student3"") with: students = (0..2).map { |i| build(:student, name: ""Student#{i}"") }  ",1202675,1,8040
The authors have implemented every test case that is discussed in the test plan. Detailed explanations and code itself is provided in the project's wiki page.,1202676,-1,8040
Features implemented in this project work as intended. After running the code manually I am getting the same coverage as stated on the wiki page. One problem is that the main object under test - participant is created using build method. factories.rb describes participant as an instance of AssignmentParticipant class. There is a possibility that this is complicating test cases or will complicate them in the future. The solution is to either define a new Participant class instance in the factory or to define it in the code itself.,1202677,1,8040
The write is very descriptive and included code from both the model and the spec file.,1203790,-1,8040
"The test plan could be more specific. For example ""Writing testing conditions for different functions"" doesn't indicate what strategies are being employed or what edge cases are being tested.",1203793,1,8040
The test for sort_by_name redundantly checks implementation parts. It needs only to test the result.,1203798,1,8040
They have not yet reached the desired goal of 90% coverage.,1203799,1,8040
Some cases haven't been implemented yet.,1203800,1,8040
The writeup explains how the tests relate to their respective methods.,1204126,-1,8040
"The writeup explains why the tests they write relate to their respective methods, but doesn't justify a 77% LoC coverage, which is below the requirements for the project.",1204127,1,8040
"The document states they have a 77% LoC coverage, but the assignment description states they need at least 90%. This is not complete.",1204129,1,8040
The added tests look very clean.,1204133,-1,8040
"CodeClimate bot reports 73 style issues, which is an awful lot. ",1204134,1,8040
Everything in the wiki was a test.,1204135,-1,8040
"Tests in the file pass, according to the video, but less than 100% coverage implies that corner cases aren't being handled.",1204136,1,8040
The doc says participant.rb model is  changed. However that file is not currently committed. However assignment_participant model file is committed. Seems to be some mismatch at one of the places. Correcting it will help in understanding what work is done and how does it impact the functionality.,1205039,1,8040
 Looks good. Explains what work is done and what is the corresponding output,1205040,-1,8040
 A more through explanation of what each testcase does will be useful. Its documented well about what the testcase will return but not what it does. Mentioning that will be useful,1205042,1,8040
Coverage has increased by 7 percent overall,1205046,-1,8040
Does not apply as its a testing project with most testcases written in a single Rspec file to test the functionality,1205047,-1,8040
Yes all 17 test cases are automated,1205048,-1,8040
Tests work,1205049,-1,8040
very clearly writeup.,1205510,-1,8040
There is no need to use the student3 and participant3.,1205518,1,8040
"It seems you have cover 94% of the participant.rb. However, all checks have failed in the pull request test.",1205519,1,8040
"No, the test failed.",1205520,1,8040
Project purpose is write test cases for participant model and increase the test coverage. This seems to be easily understandable but plan of work should nainly concentrate on how we test this functionality rather than just mentioning that test cases need to be written.,1206426,1,8040
Functionalities have been tested properly.,1206427,-1,8040
Test plan is not included however they have included the diffeedif test cases implemented and the exolaexplan is good.,1206429,1,8040
 Naming conventions are followed. Test coverage has increased. ,1206433,-1,8040
FuncyFunctionalare of correct length.,1206434,-1,8040
Test cases are present. ,1206435,-1,8040
Video covers how to run the test cases which are clear and understandable.,1206436,-1,8040
"The Wiki is descriptive and covers the essentials of the project. In my opinion, I think the code for every test is not required. It is enough to explain the structure and code for one test, maybe and what each test is supposed to do for the rest of the tests. That should suffice.",1207361,1,8040
"They have mentioned that they use ""factory"", but it hasn't been mentioned clearly how they use factories. It would be great if they can incorporate this in the Wiki.",1207362,1,8040
The test plan does not include details on preconditions or edge cases. I suggest the team to elaborate on Test Plan. Otherwise a good start.,1207364,1,8040
" All variables, methods and class names look reasonable.",1207368,-1,8040
"The code looks clean. Though I don't understand why you have used this line in the test for responses "" puts participant.response_maps"". I feel some of the code that isnt needed is commented out. Please remove this code as it was mentioned in the details. Naming and cnventions seem to be fine.",1207369,1,8040
The test plan is not about what they test in the Rspec test.,1207370,1,8040
"Yep, the spec.rb file works fine. I think only handle method hasn't been tested. This is why the coverage seems to be 94%",1207371,1,8040
the document contains the whole information including the test plans and the the expertiza environment setup. It is neatly documented as well which makes it more readable,1207899,-1,8040
Yes the have mentioned all of the required work and its related explanation. they have reasoned out their exact methods and the issues to be considered while testing in the problem statement. ,1207900,-1,8040
Yes the test appears complete as they have mentioned all from setting up the expertiza environment to the tests that they have implemented along with the plan of the they executed their project,1207902,-1,8040
"it follows the standard ruby practices . All the variables , methods and class name look reasonable. The added tests looks very clean",1207906,-1,8040
"the code looks clean . However, some of the comments are not provided for the test cases. apart from this the naming and the conventions seem to be fine",1207907,1,8040
Yes all  the 17 test cases are automated. They have reached the goal of 90% coverage . ,1207908,-1,8040
Yes all the features work as intended. The participant that is created using the build method describes participant as an instance of the assignment participant class. I observed the handle method has not been tested yet.,1207909,1,8040
"It is well written, quite understandable. It clearly and adequately indicates the working functionality. I can understand what the project is about.",1208337,-1,8040
"Yes, the writeup explains explains how the authors did their work and they have mentioned the steps behind each functionality. They have put a video explanation of the same.",1208338,-1,8040
"Yes, the Test Plan looks complete and includes all the test cases and the actions.",1208340,-1,8040
Pull request build passes well and there are no issues.,1208344,-1,8040
"Well, the code looks good and very much follows the Ruby Style Guide. The code also is DRY. It looks well written and does not any changes.",1208345,-1,8040
"Yes, the admin has included the Test Plan cases in the automated tests.",1208346,-1,8040
"Yes, after testing the work manually, I could see that their features are working as intended.",1208347,-1,8040
"The writeup was fairly specific on how the solution was implemented, although more qualitative description should have replaced the source code dumps. The writeup barely explained why the improvements were needed, focusing on what was implemented. ",1207852,1,8047
 The writeup explains to a limited extent the approach that was followed.Majority of the writeup consists of code and not how it was implemented.,1206235,1,8047
 they explained how they made the changes. Patterns if used are not noticed by looking at the code and not mentioned in the writeup,1206367,1,8047
The 'why' part is missing for the code changes. What does each code line of change do? Maybe you'll can incorporate that.,1205791,1,8047
Yes the writeup explains how and why the did the modifications. It has comparisons between the previous and new versions and why they made they made the necessary modifications.  There was no mention of using design principles or patterns.,1204527,1,8047
"Yes authors have an details about code changes that they have done and why they have done. I would have liked more emphasis on ""why"" ",1206693,0,8047
no test plan availble in the documentation.,1206237,1,8047
no test plans mentioned,1206369,1,8047
Test Plans are missing,1206535,1,8047
"The Writeup does not have a test plan. Not able to check if they considered different pre-conditions, edge cases, invalid input values, and other possibilities",1204529,1,8047
No the writeup does not have a test plan,1203460,1,8047
No test plan required I suppose.,1208381,1,8047
No the writeup does not mention the test section. ,1206695,1,8047
The background and problem statement are clear and concise. The description of the implementation is thorough but a little too detailed. It relies too much on the source code and not enough on figures and written explanation.,1207851,1,8047
"The write-up is well written along with the screenshots attached for the code changes which helps in explaining the issues and changes made to solve those.  Just one suggestion, if you are explaining all the steps and redirection for some issues/changes please keep the content consistent for other issues/changes as well.",1206366,1,8047
I could not figure out how to test the code. I could not make an account for myself because Expertiza is not set up that way. There were no setup instructions in the writeup for testing the emailing capabilities.,1207861,1,8047
"Can't test as the link to the deployed application is not working(Unable to login with correct user credentials. Even after giving forgot password, did not receive password reset email) ",1204536,1,8047
I have been unable to test the users work manually as expertiza does not allow me to send a mail to my existing mail id. I have also tried adding a new student to the assignment which was not possible( i got an error stating the student does not exist) and all existing students have the mail id( expertiza@mailinator.com) which cannot be accessed to verify.,1203467,1,8047
there are issues in the build,1206702,1,8047
"Commented-out code should be removed (at least one example found in participant_spec.rb). Also, there are some indentation issues as well as other issues flagged by CodeClimate. Otherwise, the code seems to comply with the Ruby Style Guide and be fairly DRY.",1207859,1,8047
"1. Functions are of appropriate length 2. Codes are in appropriate methods 3. Code is very well commented. Overall, great work. Clearly Understandable.",1204534,0,8047
Code climate show 99 issues in the code. Many lines aren't properly aligned. Commented code hasn't been removed.,1208386,1,8047
"Comments in code are missing. There are few lines that need to be removed but still exist, it would be nice to delete those eg #emails << assignment.instructor.email   Function length looks okay, most functions have len < 20 lines which is an acceptable number. Since the code is implementing very specific issues over it has specific local changes.  Other change are okay and ruby like",1206700,1,8047
not adequate explanation.,1206241,1,8047
set_proposer is a setter but appears to be used as a getter.,1208385,1,8047
"Authors could use empty? instead of checking unityId != ''. Another thing that the authors have taken care of ttml mails but what if the somone needs to non-html mails.  attribute copy_of_all_emails does not look like a good name, it would be nice if they could rename it to email_copy_all or so this help in reader understand as well as in ide intellisense.  Code coverage has decreased     ",1206699,1,8047
Minimal changes were made to the test suite and new tests were not written for the new code.,1207860,1,8047
NO TESTS added.,1206243,1,8047
"Test cases were not mentioned. Can't test as the link to the deployed application is not working(Unable to login with correct user credentials.

Testing has not been done yet.,1203466,1,8047
No test plan. Don't know why this question is even asked.,1208387,1,8047
No,1206701,1,8047
The tests have been added as per the test plan but some of them have not seemed to have passed. The team could have a look at the tests not passing and work on them.,1205093,1,8038
Test plan is not mentioned. Currently test cases are not running because of model file missing. Youtube video with description will be useful to show how the tests are running and if any of them fail,1205028,1,8038
No Automated tests.,1207808,1,8038
"Again, since their entire project is on RSpec testing, so this aspect has been well taken care of. ",1206681,-1,8038
"As mentioned by the team, more code needs to be added for 90% coverage.",1207696,-1,8038
The tests are included,1208701,-1,8038
The variable names seems good,1205091,-1,8038
Not enough data for judgement,1205237,1,8038
 One file is missing. May be a commit issue. Test coverage is not mentioned. Pull request is not raised so it does not mention about the whether the test coverage increased or not. ,1205026,1,8038
Haven't uploaded the link for the pull request.,1207806,1,8038
Pull request has not been submitted or uploaded at all which makes it hard to decipher any of the above data hence make it a problematic scenario to certain what all changes have been made in the first in the terms of number of commits or pull request. ,1206679,1,8038
Can't find the pull request to comment on this,1205549,1,8038
"Code follows standards but variable names can be better and more 'readable'. Another suggestion: declare ALL variables first then use those variables to call methods. When you add/declare variables in between method calls, it looks as though you 'forgot' to declare earlier and added them later. Just a thought !",1207694,1,8038
"Some names are ambiguous, like pptn, I cannot know clearly what this name is for.  ",1208699,1,8038
It follows the DRY principle,1205092,-1,8038
Just one contributor,1205238,1,8038
Difficult to understand what are the changes .,1205027,-1,8038
Code written follows the Ruby Style Guide.,1207807,-1,8038
"Please extract all ""let"" to avoid the repeat code. ",1205590,1,8038
"1. Functions are of appropriate length and well structured with respect to the purpose in question.  2. All code has been suitably well put into the methods with their intended function and work cutout for them.  3. No, the comments have been well placed and self explanatory making it easy to follow.  4. The code does follow the ruby style guidelines and is thorough in that regard.  5. Nope, all code is consistent and to the point. ",1206680,-1,8038
"Very well written, clean and concise.",1207695,-1,8038
"For each cases, it include too many things need to be test, it is better to separate them into different cases. Also, the object used for this test seems not be put into the factory, it is better to make them into factory which is a good practice. The use of context is not good enough.",1208700,1,8038
It seems to work well.,1205094,-1,8038
Including basic Understanding of the problem statement and work will help in manual testing.,1205029,1,8038
Impossible to do since no submission or uploading of the image have been done for this project. It is unclear how to decipher any meaningful data without the help of pull request as well. ,1206682,1,8038
Manually Tested the Test Code and 97% covered(validated via Coverage.index file),1205552,-1,8038
All the tests pass successfully.,1208702,-1,8038
The functionality has been written well. Though I do feel it would have been better if the test cases implemented had been explained in more detail as to what the do.,1205084,1,8038
No pull request link,1205230,1,8038
"The write has only details of team members and files changed. Out of the two files mentioned , only one is currently committed in git(vm_question_response.rb) is missing. May be a commit issue.",1205019,1,8038
More details required regarding the functionality for which the test cases have been written.,1207799,1,8038
"Yes, the team has taken care of it by specially making a section of what is the problem as the introductory section of the WIKI doc so as to make us understand the goals of the project. They have even attached code snaps of the relevant changes they have in mind whilst explaining the error. Although, one questions the details in which they should have gone into explaining the errors and resolution. More mentioning of details is required. ",1206672,1,8038
Yes. I can understand the intention of the test. Nicely done,1205542,-1,8038
The writeup has proper instructions but needs some improvements: 1. Explain the problem statement  2. Explain 'why' you need the solution 3. Explain the steps you took. The code snippets are added but could be improved by adding explanation of the tests. May be adding 1-2 lines can help.,1207687,1,8038
There are not enough introductions about what the functionality of the class they will test and what it is used for. The team can introduce more about what expertiza is and what the role of the class will be test and its functions. ,1208692,1,8038
Feel a pretty good job has been done.,1205087,-1,8038
 Test plan documentation is missing currently. Plan will help to relate with the code and understand if things are tested appropriately and the response is as expected or not,1205022,1,8038
"Since, their entire problem relies on the RSpec testing framework itself, they have implemented it in a good and a concise manner. ",1206675,-1,8038
"Yes, testing is thorough ",1207690,-1,8038
"The plan is simple and don't list detailed cases for each method, also it does not include various  conditions may include.",1208695,1,8038
The writeup does a good job in explaining how the authors did the work they did. ,1205085,-1,8038
 No details about the problem statement is mentioned currently. So it is difficult to understand the test code directly.,1205020,1,8038
Yes.,1207800,-1,8038
"Yes, they surely have done a good job in mentioning the errors in the wiki doc. They have vaguely described the handling of the same, but doubts remain in the details or the changes in the code. Which means that a better job and a more technical description of how It is happening should be given so as to grasp a better understanding for the same.   ",1206673,1,8038
Need a bit of detailed explanation on 'why' and 'how'. Too many screenshots with little explanation in words.,1207688,1,8038
The motivation is not enough. It is a little bit simple and general. The team should add the introduction to the specific motivation for this project.,1208693,1,8038
Basic test missing.,1206493,-1,8060
Seems like some tests have failed.,1207716,-1,8060
"Yes, converted Test Plan into automated tests.",1205299,-1,8060

All the cases discussed in the Test Plan have been converted into automated tests.,1202736,1,8060
all the test scenarios are included in rspec. The tests are also increasing the test coverage. Great job!,1204744,1,8060
"The variables, methods and class names are aptly named. I could not find names which are not suggestive of functionality. (i) The writeup is well written and easy to read.  (ii) It is adequately descriptive of the work done.  (iii) Explanation of reasons for the style of code and problem solving approach is lacking.",1206063,1,8060
The names of variables and methods are aptly chosen and clearly understandable.,1204417,-1,8060
All the method names/variable names and class names are intuitive and according to Ruby standards.,1202734,-1,8060
All the names are intuitive and reasonable. Good job following naming conventions!,1204742,-1,8060
No long functions No separate methods required. Follows Ruby Style Guide.,1205298,-1,8060
"The code does follow ""good Ruby and Rails coding practices"". No bad naming. Every file is properly named based on their functionalities. I cannot find issues with coding. One method handles only one task. I could not find any bugs in the system and this works exactly how it is supposed to work.",1206064,-1,8060
"The code is concise with 3 functions in the controller. Sufficient comments are used to explain the logic. The code follows the DRY principle, as there is no repetition seen in the code. ",1204418,-1,8060
The code follows Ruby Style Guise and follows DRY principle. None of the functions is too long.,1202735,-1,8060
none of the functions are too long could find changes where DRY principle was violated the code follows ruby convention and guidelines comments were included wherever necessary. the code is easy to follow. Good Job!,1204743,-1,8060
"Yes, works properly.",1205300,-1,8060
Test case implementation is not done.,1202505,-1,8060
No bugs found. Works as intended. The System works without any glitches. ,1206066,-1,8060
"The features work correctly, as expected. The instructor login only has one ""Student View"" tab under the Manage menu. On clicking it the instructor is successfully redirected to the student view page which has the ""Close Student View"" button to redirect to the default view. ",1204420,1,8060
The features perfectly work as intended.,1202737,-1,8060
all the scenarios including the corner cases are working fine. No issues or problems were found with the functionality. The only issue is related to the CI built which is failing at the moment. The team needs to analyse the root cause related to the build failure and fix it. Other than that it was a great team effort!,1204745,1,8060
Explained clearly in the wiki!,1207707,-1,8060
Explains well. Consists of all sub topics.,1205290,-1,8060
The wiki has been written in a very clean and readable way. It is very legible and I could understand what the project does and how the project does what it does.,1206056,-1,8060

"Yes, the team has considered the two important and required test cases- 1) To check whether ""Assignments"" is not present in the Instructor view, and check the presence of ""Open Student View"" button in the flyout menu. Here, the team has also checked the precondition whether the user is viewing the correct page (tree_display/list) which is meant for the Instructor.  2) To check the presence of ""Close Student View"" button for the instructor to return back to the default view and have the ""Assignment""  tab for students.  Suggestion: The team could add a line to check whether the system returns back to the instructor page after clicking the ""Close Student View"" button. maybe include : ""expect(page).to have_current_path('/tree_display/list')"" .  ",1204413,1,8060
The test plan looks complete.,1202730,-1,8060
The team did a great work in creating automated scripts for the cases related to the scenario. The scripts are also included in the automated test plan.  ,1204738,-1,8060

The writeup clearly explains the implementation details and why those changes were made. It is nicely articulated and leaves no ambiguity.,1202728,1,8060
The write-up contains the information about how the solution was achieved. The details about why the solution was implemented in this way is currently missing from the documentation. The team should include the same in the documentation as well.,1204736,1,8060

"The test works well, but there is no edge case.",1204276,1,8095
The project is about adding tests to the a model. So this is okay but there is not sufficient background on the model itself. More details would be good for the uninitiated.  Also they mention that the number of tests for the model were not sufficient. It would have been better if they would have quoted the code coverage numbers before and after.     ,1205686,1,8095
The submission is about adding tests to the project  and authors have done a great job of adding 92% code coverage.  I would have liked to see more -ve test cases for example cases such as user with incorrect names. As of now the test cases only checks of the user name is present or not. How about the case where user name is such that it is not allowed. User class throws an exception or add method can. This could have been documented. ,1205689,1,8095
I would have liked to see more use of context in the tests and grouping of similar test methods in context.   ,1205694,1,8095
Yes lot of new tests added and the addition of the tests has 92% code coverage. Great job,1205695,-1,8095

In due_date_color switch case would have been a better approach then if else if block. Lots of code that is done in view can be moved to the controller. Follow MVC architecture. ,1203108,-1,8030
 The functions seem to be implemented in a good manner and the code seems to be DRY.. In some cases though the authors could have improved as in the i app/helpers/student_task_helper.rb  file. In side the due_date_color method they could have used case expressions in Ruby instead of the if else logic implemented as that would be a more Ruby on Rails way of doing it. As it will reduce the lines of code as well as being a more elegant way of handling it.,1207472,-1,8030
"In the due_date_color(due_date), instead of hardcoding the color vs interval, it would have been more useful if those are pulled from a config file.

Such harcoded stuffs make the view strongly coupled with the style elements, which could have been avoided. <hr style=""height:2px;border:none;color:#e3e3e3;background-color:#e3e3e3;""   Also, the UI changes are not showing up properly aligned.

Thee writeup page is concise and easy to understand but there is no insight into the code.,1208784,1,8030
Screenshots are missing under Test Plan section.,1206508,1,8030
Writeup is readable and written properly. Team could have added code snippet and pictures of changed or improved functionality. Also team could work upon formatting and could also add links and references.,1206160,-1,8030
"Please include the code snippet that was changed and also a screenshot of the view before and after the change.  Also, Please provide the link to the pull request and not the repo created. Good written explanation of the changes done in WIKI.",1203100,-1,8030
The wiki documentation has been updated. All the information has been documented in a neat and logical manner. The write up adequately provides what functionality the work is related to. The project changes to the code have been described in paragraphs which could have been better if they could have updated with code snippets and screen shots of the tasks at hand.,1207464,-1,8030
"Wiki has been well written, with enough clarity and description",1203802,-1,8030
It is clear what the project does and why it does it.,1204905,-1,8030
The writeup is clear. It is easy to understand what the project does. It would be better if you can put in more code details and major pieces that do the important logic.,1205398,-1,8030
The writeup is pretty clear.,1204290,-1,8030
"The test plan section is present, and it is covering all the scenarios.",1208787,-1,8030
"Wiki page does talk about test plan. But it is explained in brief, but no details of test scenarios or testing technology to be used.  ",1206163,1,8030
Few test cases are missing context and it block so it is difficult to understand what the test case is doing unless you read the entire code.,1203103,1,8030
They seem to have included a testing plan have mentioned it in their report. They seem to have considered edge cases and other possibilities.,1207467,-1,8030
"I could think of 1 missing test case, where an assignment due date changes from future to past, that assignment should now appear in the past assignment section,   apart from this test case, all edge cases have been covered.",1203805,1,8030
"Not much has been explained about the test plan. The authors have, however, explained how they will be going about the testing in general. An overview is provided which is clear to understand.",1204908,-1,8030
"It feels like test plan only covers one aspect - ""changing of the background color for tasks as we approach the deadline.""   here are other aspects which can be automated for testing, perhaps by Rspec or the likes:  Add past due assignments to the students task list (on Student View). -- Verify if they are being added/saved Check for correction in due dates of assignments (when an assignments due date is edited, it should be appropriately moved from the Past assignments list to the Current Assignments list if needed) --- Check if the functionality works. On Student Task page, separate the list of 'teamed with' students from the current tasks box. -- test if this works Write the required tests before implementing/refactoring the methods in the above-mentioned classe ",1205401,1,8030
"More details are expected in the Test Plan like edge cases, normal cases.",1208022,1,8030
There is no edge case.,1204293,1,8030
The writeup explains everything regarding why and how the steps were carried out.,1208785,-1,8030
"Yes, Writeup explains the approach taken by team to solve the issue, theoretically. Team could have explained the issues and resolution practically. Also no design pattern or principle were used.",1206161,1,8030
It only explains how they did but not why they did. The various approach could have been mentioned in the WIKI.,1203101,1,8030
The authors have documented the steps they did to solve the issues. Although they haven't mentioned any particular design principles or design thinking that went on in solving the issues. They should have  explained all the functionalities of each file they have modified and stated why they have modified the particular file. One thing they could have added were class diagrams and dependency maps. Or some pictorial representation of the flow of each task which will help the reviewers and instructors to quickly catch up on their idea.,1207465,1,8030
"Wiki has been well written, with enough clarity and description",1203803,-1,8030
They have explained how they have implemented each task by adding/editing files.,1204906,-1,8030
"The writeup only tells what is to be done and how it is done. The rational behind choosing the approach is not mentioned, neither are any of the principles mentioned.",1205399,1,8030
"It is better to state the change of the feature or added feature with diagram to show the difference, to state what remains the same and what is added or update understand certain circumstances. ",1208020,-1,8030
"Yes, the writeup explains what the authors did.",1204291,-1,8030
"I think their introduction and issue sections clearly shows what functionality the work is related to, they also add some screenshots which help me understand what they have done. But I can not understand what is bookmark and what it is used for, I think it is difficult for someone like me who have not used bookmark to understand these with only a short description. If they can write something more about bookmarks it will be better. ",1205194,1,8103
The team has created a new spec file to test all the issues of the PR.,1205431,-1,8034
All tests pass.,1208157,-1,8034
Yes.,1202600,-1,8034
No automated tests. But the fix seems to be working fine as per the test plan provided.,1209106,1,8034
"Yes, the cases discussed have been converted into appropriate tests. ",1208817,-1,8034
Cannot check. Link ,1202456,1,8034
Adequate testing was performed using RSpec tests for both the issues.,1204355,-1,8034
They have converted the test cases mentioned in the test plan into automated tests. The tests have been implemented as mentioned in the write-up.  ,1208634,-1,8034
"The team has made minimal changes in the code to fix the issues. No new class, function or variable has been added.",1205429,-1,8034
No issues found.,1208155,-1,8034
The newly added code adheres to ruby programming standards.,1202598,-1,8034
Test plan is clear but doesn't have any test cases.,1209104,1,8034
The names used seem appropriate to their intended functionality.,1204353,-1,8034
"The variables, methods and class names are named appropriately. The variables used in the program suggest the functionality.",1208632,-1,8034
The code resolves all the issues as per the problem statement and the features work correctly.,1205432,-1,8034
It works as expected.,1208158,1,8034
"I was able to create a new user with the username ""abc def"". Although the changes made to the code seem to be sufficient to fix this, the deployment does not seem to reflect the changes.",1202601,1,8034
Seems to be working.,1209107,-1,8034
Wiki or read me does not include instructor or student credential so couldn't check anything.,1206034,1,8034
The features for the issues fixed work as intended.,1204356,-1,8034
The author's work is implemented well and is implemented as expected. Few edge cases can be written to test the code completely.,1208635,1,8034
The team has explained the problem statement as well as the approach they has chosen with lot of details. It makes it very easy for end user to understand details of the project.  ,1205422,-1,8034
"Yes, I was able to understand the issue as well as the solution overall. But I couldn't understand why there is a need to append a team name to an assignment. It was just mentioned that it is done in other part of the code as well. Mentioning that would have given me a better idea.",1208148,1,8034
"The write up has been written well. There's obviously some additions possible to the write up. The code changes/additions have been shown, I would recommend description of why those changes/additions were made. I would also suggest the team to standardize the size of their screenshots. ",1202591,1,8034
Write up is clearly understandable. Systematic approach taken to fix the issue.,1209097,-1,8034
Write up is quite impressive. I was able to understand the project through write up.,1206024,-1,8034
The write-up is good and clearly mentions the issues to be corrected.,1204346,-1,8034
The problem is explained clearly and the implementation plan is also described elaborately. The explanation helps in understanding the project very well.  ,1208625,-1,8034
There are no additions in terms of methods or any new implementation. There are minuscule changes done so it still follows the existing standard. ,1205430,-1,8034
There were not many big changes. All the changes are crisp and to the point.,1208156,-1,8034
The team has done well not to over complicate the issues and have resolved them with relatively few additions.,1202599,-1,8034
Functions are named properly.,1209105,-1,8034
The code follows Ruby style Guidelines and is DRY.,1204354,-1,8034
"The functions are not too long so the code doesn't have to be extracted into separate methods. More comments could have been added for easy understanding of the code. The code follows the Ruby style guide and the code looks refactored, statements ""unless"" keyword are written in a single line.",1208633,1,8034
The team has included test plan as well as the screenshot of the manual testing.,1205425,-1,8034
"While the test plan for fixing team names have been shown, i couldn't find the test plan for validating username.",1208151,1,8034
Test plan has been well implemented for one of the issues. The test plan does not show what happens if a user tries to create a new account with a space in the username. ,1202594,1,8034
Write up has test plan with clear steps and screenshots.,1209100,-1,8034
They have covered few edge cases. Just a suggestion to include result before and after fixing the issue. May be juxtapose it.,1206027,-1,8034
"Yes, the project deals with an issue related to names, such as not allowing whitespaces , etc. The test verify that the issues are now solved.",1208811,-1,8034
The test plan looks good. It includes both manual testing and automated testing by writing Rspec tests.,1204349,-1,8034
"The test plan is explained in a good manner, but the edge cases and invalid values are not mentioned. What if a space is in front of the username. ",1208628,1,8034
The write-up explains the approach used and the code used for implementation very clearly. The test plan is also defined extensively. Screenshots help in understanding the implementation more. They did not use any design patterns. ,1208626,-1,8034
The write-up clearly mentions the issues to be fixed and the code changed to fix each issue.,1204347,-1,8034
No write-up available rn,1202448,1,8034
They standardized the team name generation and fixed the username without space. For design patterns I think they didn't used it may be it wasn't needed,1206025,-1,8034
Write up explains about the problem and how it needs to be fixed which seemed logical,1209098,-1,8034
"How has been shown well through the screenshots but why has not yet been described. No particular reference to a design pattern has been made, but that is understandable since their project was based more on changes and less on additions to the code.",1202592,1,8034
"The how part is clear. As to the why part, thought they have clearly mentioned the the problem statement, i think a little bit more of an explanation could go into why is that actually a problem.",1208149,1,8034
Yes the team has done great job in the write up It is properly indexed and addresses details about each issue and its solution.,1205423,-1,8034
All of the cases discussed in the Test Plan have been included in the test file. And all of them are also passing. Very good!!,1206021,-1,8120
The tests have been properly converted into automated tests.,1204159,-1,8120
The test cases are covered in the coded.,1205615,-1,8120
They kept working on this test and improved it.,1205824,-1,8120
The names are very intuitive. The build doesn't seem to have been passed because of the indentation errors and failure to follow certain design guidelines.,1206019,-1,8120
"the code follows correct name structure for variables, methods and class.",1204157,-1,8120
All the names are used properly.,1205613,-1,8120
Code contribution of all team members. The code doesn not smell dry,1209017,-1,8120
"The test cases are cleanly written following good practices. Some of the indentation needs to be adjusted to contain better readability. Also, within the menu_rpec file, you are essentially testing two classes Node and Menu. I am not sure why that is. Is the node class and inner class of menu? Maybe these two classes should be separated into different rspec files to ensure a better naming setup. Maybe this could be clarified in the wiki so that readers would understand the design choice. Overall great work.",1203525,1,8120
"The code looks good. It seems well ordered, structured, and 'DRY'.",1206020,-1,8120
the function definition is of perfect size. the code follows the Ruby Style Guide.,1204158,-1,8120
"Most of the codes are well strutted, but something like ""returns an equivalent item"" is long and it is better to separate them.",1205614,1,8120
Yes.,1205827,-1,8120
No idea how to manually test the authors file.,1206022,-1,8120
all the tests are working properly except one. A pretty good work has been done.,1204160,1,8120
The tests all pass successfully.,1205616,-1,8120
Clearly.,1205817,-1,8120
The wiki document was very clear with respect to the responsibilities of the group. it also detailed their approach to writing the tests as well as explained the functionalities that the tests were written on. Well done!,1206012,-1,8120
The write up is perfectly written.It clearly describes what functionality the work is related to. It gives information for each aspect of the project.,1204150,-1,8120
"The team has introduced the functions clearly, but it may be better to also include the introduction of expertise itself. Besides, the motivation is general, add some specific details for this project would be better. As far as I am concerned, for the functionality of the menu, the introduction is also a little bit general. Adding more details about what the function of the menu, so we can know clearly what should be tested and if the test is enough.",1205606,1,8120
Test plan is well-rounded.,1205820,-1,8120
The test plan describes the flow of the tests and what the expected values of the objects should be in certain scenarios however I didn't find any mention of edge cases or invalid input values.,1206015,1,8120
"The test plan is accurate and checks for different pre conditions , edge cases , invalid input values. I could not find any missed scenarios.",1204153,-1,8120
test cases are thorough,1208799,-1,8120
"For the methods that include different conditions, they provided tests fo different kinds of conditions. Also, for each method, the team test various aspects of the method.",1205609,-1,8120
Well explained information about the Design and the results.,1209010,-1,8120
"The overall purpose of the project, the need for mocks/stubs, and the scenarios of each test case are very well presented; however, there is little explanation about why certain tests were implemented in any particular fashion. It would be a nice addition to include a few of your test cases and explain your reasoning behind why/how you implemented that test case. Adding this would further clarify your design/testing plan choices and make for a fantastic read.",1203518,1,8120
The write up is enough for me to understand.,1205818,-1,8120
The document explained well the work and the approach to doing the work.,1206013,-1,8120
The write up is clear with its goal. It nicely explains how and why did the author work in a particular way.  ,1204151,-1,8120
"The wiki give the motivation for this project, but it is general and should be more detailed for this project.",1205607,1,8120
"Although the test plan looks good, I am not able to see any test cases added in the pull request.",1208437,1,8044
There is no test plan included.,1208670,1,8079
All the cases are covered.,1208622,-1,8079
Testing isn't applicable to this assignment. ,1205127,-1,8079
All the tests have been added as per the test plan and have been run successfully.,1207302,-1,8044
No test plan added in writeup or explained otherwise.,1205463,1,8079
The authors have not converted test cases into automated tests. However manual testing has been shown in the vedio link attached,1204343,1,8079
The tests scripts are not written for the changes.,1205838,1,8079
Testing is not covered.,1207382,1,8079
All provided variables are well assigned.,1208668,-1,8079
Good thing would be to increase the test coverage.,1206421,1,8079
Variables and methods seemed intuitive enough,1208620,-1,8079
Build isn't passing. Write up isn't passable. No screenshots or explaination in write up of what you h=are doing and why.,1205461,1,8079
The coverage has decreased as per the tools that run by default on raising pull request by 13.6 %,1205125,1,8079
The pull request did not pass the tests and the names assigned seem appropriate to their functionality.,1204341,1,8079
"All the names are intuitive and reasonable apart from ""drop_topic_deadline1"". The team need to change this variable name to something more precise other than that Good job following naming conventions!",1205836,1,8079
Code looks good. Namings are also ok. Print statements are also pushed(not expected!).,1207380,1,8079
"The test cases are quite illustrative, however they have not been automated.",1203514,1,8044
The functions added are not too long. This is the minimal amount of code that had to be added to implement the changes.,1208669,-1,8079
The automated tests were not created for the scenarios. ,1204796,1,8044
The commits show contribution by only 1 author. The code does not smell DRY.,1205274,1,8079
"Some functions have the same code deleted and added again which could've been avoided, like  schema.rb line 105 & 110, lines 741-743 & 745-747 and more lines similarly in that file",1205126,1,8079
In the code topic_id1 and @drop_topic_deadline1 name doesn't seems to follow the ruby guide line and you should probably name them differently like first_topic_id and first_drop_topic_deadline. ,1205462,1,8079
No rspec tests are written to test the changes.,1203332,-1,8044
"The code is DRY however, certain sections of the code could be shortened further.",1204342,1,8079
"none of the functions are too long could find changes where DRY principle was violated the code follows ruby convention and guidelines Although the code is easy to follow , the team needs to add comments for the changes which is currently missing. Good Job!",1205837,1,8079
They did not write test code.,1206279,1,8044
More comments are needed.,1207381,-1,8079
everything seems to be working fine.,1206424,-1,8079
"Since the code is not deployed, manually testing cannot be performed. But, the screencast shows that all the manual testing is passed.",1208623,1,8079
From the video it seems it should work fine with the edge cases as well.,1205464,-1,8079
The variable and method names look clean and concise. No new class is added.,1208435,1,8044
Manual testing could not be performed as the link to the deployed application was not available however the vedio link attached sufficiently demonstrates how the features work.,1204344,1,8079
all the scenarios including the corner cases are working fine. No issues or problems were found with the functionality. The only issue is related to the CI built which is failing at the moment. The team needs to analyse the root cause related to the build failure and fix it. Other than that it was a great team effort!  ,1205839,1,8079
The information provided is good but the page is not organised and the code is confusing. Team should work on improving the format of content(the way they are representing info).,1208661,1,8079
The write up seems quite understandable. ,1206414,-1,8079
"The write up is well written and explain how and what is done in the project regarding all the issues.  Just one suggestion- it would have been great if the screenshots were uploaded corresponding to the changes made. But, otherwise the writeup is understandable. ",1208613,-1,8079
The code added in the pull request is reasonable.,1203512,-1,8044
All the names are intuitive and reasonable. Good job following naming conventions!  ,1204794,-1,8044
"Yes, the project is to do 2 things : 1. Stop teams from dropping assignments very late / close to deadline 2. Have different deadlines when assignments are done at different periods. The wiki should be created on expertiza page and not on wikipedia site.",1205118,1,8079
"The code you have added in the write up isn't indented, its hard to understand this way. You need to make the write up more readable.",1205454,1,8079
The write-up is clear and clearly explains the issues corrected.,1204334,-1,8079
"The wiki is well written and contains all required information regarding the project. The screenshots can be included in the wiki and the code pasted in the documentation could be formatted. The team also need to inlcude the test plan section in the wiki. Apart from this , the team did a great work.   ",1205829,1,8079
Variable names methods and class names look fine to me.,1203330,-1,8044
"Good, but lacks readability. The code is directly copy-pasted in the approach section. You could have used the pseudo code with proper explanations. The structure and formatting should be improved.",1207373,1,8079
No test plan is included but it seems that team have covered all the scenarios properly.,1208664,-1,8079
The write up does not have a test plan.,1205269,1,8079
Write up doesnt include test plan. Good thing would be include the testing steps they have performed. Few screenshots would be helpful as well.,1206417,1,8079
I found the test cases to be sufficient. No suggestion needed.,1208616,-1,8079
I don't think there's any testing involved in this assignment.,1205121,-1,8079
The functions are small and well defined. ,1208436,-1,8044
"Writeup doesn't has a test plan but in the video they have tested a lot. Also please add audio as well in your video explaining what you are doing and why so that its easy for the user to understand, otherwise watching 23 minutes silent videos is just to much.",1205457,1,8079
No proper test plan has been mentioned yet in the write-up. But a link to demo vedio is available which includes the manual testing case.,1204337,1,8079
Test Plan section is not maintained in the documentation,1205832,1,8079
Test plan section is missing.,1207376,1,8079
"The code seems to follow good Ruby on Rails Coding practices. The implemented code is DRY. they could have increased commenting  by making comments more descriptive.  The comments for say a particular function could have included  the input arguments, their data types and the return value and its data type if any. But overall it looks to be good commenting coverage.",1207301,1,8044
The code added appears to be dry.,1203513,-1,8044
"Writeup clearly explains why the team followed the particular approach and additionally mentions all the steps followed,thus defining the approach clearly.",1208662,-1,8079
"none of the functions are too long could find changes where DRY principle was violated the code follows ruby convention and guidelines Although the code is easy to follow, the comments should be included for the created methods/changes. apart from that Good Job!",1204795,-1,8044
"The writeup does talk about the changes and why the authors did it that way.   Rather than pasting the code (without any indentation) in the wiki page, the authors could have pasted screenshots of the code! This might have made it easier to comprehend.    ",1205267,1,8079
"The writers have explained what they did in the project and how they did it. But, I could not find a 'why'. No reason behind the approach is specified.",1208614,1,8079
The readme was sufficient to explain details about the idea and also both the videos explain stepwise how this is achieved and demonstrates it. Also the bugs are fixed and droptopicdeadline has been integrated into the code of this assignment.,1205119,-1,8079
"The code is readable and no function is too long. Suggestion: The impersonating_as_admin? and impersonating_as_ta? function uses the same session variable, so you can try to declare it above these functions and reuse it to follow DRY principle",1203331,1,8044
It's hard to understand the code you have changed from writeup. I saw the changes in your pull request it looks good to me.,1205455,1,8079
Inadequate information,1202460,1,8079
The functions are not too long and the code does not need to be extracted to separate methods. COmments could have been added for a better understanding of the code. The code follows Ruby lines and the lines are compressed. for eg : Unless and if statements are compressed,1209137,-1,8044
The writeup mentions what lines of code were changed but it does not clearly specify what each changed portion of code means.,1204335,1,8079
The write-up contains the information about how the solution was achieved. The details about why the solution was implemented in this way is currently missing from the documentation. The team should include the same in the documentation as well.  ,1205830,1,8079
Not very comprehensive.,1207374,1,8079
The feature works as it is supposed to. Don't see any issues.,1208438,-1,8044
Could not do manual testing as the project was not deployed but screencasts shows the testing so can conclude that it passed all the manual test.,1208041,-1,8044
The features have been implemented correctly and work well on all the edge cases.,1207303,-1,8044
The link to the deployed application was not available.,1203515,1,8044
"all the basic scenarios are working fine. No issues or problems were found with the functionality. There is an issue related to the CI built which is failing at the moment. The team needs to analyse the root cause related to the build failure and fix it. Also the scenario where the TA is assigned to a instructor , what will happen to the instructors impersonated students when the TA of the constructor login to the application. The scenario could not be tested as the same is missing from video and the application is not deployed. Other than that it was a great team effort",1204797,1,8044
"Cannot perform manual testing, as application is not deployed or the link is not provided. However, checked from the screencast and issue seems to be resolved",1203333,1,8044
Edge cases could have been implemented.,1209139,1,8044
"They did not provide the link for me to test, only a video is provided, according to the video their features work pretty well.  ",1206280,-1,8044
The write up clearly captures the functionality that the work is related to.,1208428,-1,8044
Very clear.,1207588,-1,8044
well explained in the video file,1204378,-1,8044
The write up is good as I was able to understand the issue to be fixed and the implemented approach.  I would like to suggest the team to standardize the size of their screenshots though.,1208031,-1,8044
 The wiki documentation has been updated and is thorough. All the information has been documented in a neat and logical manner. The write up adequately provides what functionality the work is related to. The project changes have been well documented with code snippets. They have added screenshots of working functionalities that they have fixed which seems a good idea to convey the working functionality properly.,1207293,-1,8044
The writeup is good and clearly mentions the issues to be solved.,1203505,-1,8044
"The wiki is well written and contains all required information regarding the project. The only scenario missing from the documentation is the scenario where the TA is assigned to a instructor , what will happen to the instructors impersonated students when the TA of the constructor login to the application. Apart from this , the team did a great work. ",1204787,1,8044
"The writeup clearly explains the issues and the approach used to achieve the desired results. Suggestion: The authors should try to include the rspec test documentation, for the newly fixed issues.",1203323,-1,8044
They wrote clear and adequate description and I can clearly understand what their project does.,1206270,-1,8044
The test plan looks good enough for the fix they have provided.,1208431,-1,8044
The authors have included a thorough test plan and they seem to have considered a lot of test cases. The tests convey they entire flow properly and show that the bugs have been fixed.,1207296,-1,8044
"Yes, the test plan looks complete enough and all the edge cases have been tested. The document also includes the screenshots of the manual testing.",1208034,-1,8044
The test plan is very good and there is also a video file which clearly shows the manual testing being done.,1203508,-1,8044
"all the scenarios are explained in detailed. The only edge cases which is missing from the documentations is: the scenario where the TA is assigned to a instructor , what will happen to the instructors impersonated students when the TA of the constructor login to the application The team should this scenarios and include the same as the part of the documentation and automated script in the test plan.",1204790,-1,8044
"The authors have included a series of steps to perform the test and have provided screenshots, but do not cover other possibilities.",1203326,1,8044
The test plan could have been explained more elaborately. Edge cases could have been covered.,1209132,1,8044
"They wrote many test cases I think they are enough, but I didn't find edge cases or invalid input tests. ",1206273,-1,8044
The write-up explains what they did but doesn't mention why they choose to implement the feature this way,1208429,0,8044
"Authors have clearly explained what needs to be done to fix the issue, how it is done and why it is done.",1208032,-1,8044
The authors have documented the steps they did to solve the issues in a clean manner. Although they haven't mentioned any particular design principles or design thinking that went on in solving the issues. They have explained all the functionalities of each file they have modified and stated why they have modified the particular file. One thing they could have added were class diagrams and dependency maps. Or some pictorial representation of the flow of each task which will help the reviewers and instructors to quickly catch up on their idea.,1207294,1,8044
"The write-up mentions the function of each section of the relevant code, however it is not clear what the changes made to the code are.",1203506,1,8044
The write-up contains the information about how the solution was achieved. The details about why the solution was implemented in this way is currently missing from the documentation. The team should include the same in the documentation as well.,1204788,1,8044
"The writeup does emphasize on how the issues are resolved, however lacks a reasoning as to why did they choose it.  Suggestion: It is hard to follow the code, as there is lack of comments. You can try to include meaningful comments for every function you have introduced. That will increase code readability",1203324,1,8044
No design patterns were used. The write up explains the implementation and screenshots of code explains the flow better.,1209130,-1,8044
"I could understand what the project does. However, there are fewer examples of the test.",1203156,1,8074
"No, this writeup doesn't have a test plan section.",1203159,1,8074
"Some ""let"" methods, like participant2, student2, response_map2, are repetitive.",1203164,1,8074
There's basically no documentation outside the source code itself.,1204102,1,8074
There's not really a rationale for why these particular tests are sufficient.,1204103,-1,8074
It's unclear how complete the test plan is because their wiki does not contain their total branch or mutation coverage.,1204105,1,8074
Rspec tests look just fine and descriptions are intuitive.,1204109,-1,8074
The tests look fine. It's easy to follow what the tests do.,1204110,-1,8074
"All tests pass, all descriptions in the Test Plan are just the test cases in the Rspec file, sooooooo yeah I guess they all exist.",1204111,-1,8074
"The video shows all the test cases pass, but I'm skeptical that they got all the corner cases. Looking at the review_response_map.rb model, there are a lot of methods which aren't explicitly tested.",1204112,1,8074
"The authors have included the different tests that they wrote, however a description of what the test is testing would be helpful.",1205595,1,8074
"As this rubric calls for a section called Test Plan, I suggest adding it and rearranging the wiki content, so that a description of the tests is given in this section",1205597,1,8074
Variable names and test cases are named appropriately. Explanation of reasons for the style of code and problem solving approach is lacking.,1205601,1,8074
Code is well written.,1205602,-1,8074
Authors have followed Ruby style guide. Test cases have not been discussed in the write-up.,1205603,1,8074
"Code is running and no errors are encountered. However, very few tests have been written and coverage is low. A way to make the testing more robust is to test every function with a known success case and  an edge case or potential failure.",1205604,1,8074
the wiki page has showed up what the expertiza is and some examples have show up what the task of the team is.,1205638,-1,8074
"the team does not show up any design patterms. in the wiki page, the authors did not explain how and why they did, and what I can see is just the final code for some perticular exmples.",1205639,1,8074
I can not find the test plan.,1205641,1,8074
the writeup is lacking in terms of explanation of how to test the funcionality thoroughly.,1205645,1,8074
I cannot find test plan.,1205647,1,8074
the work takes care of all the edge cases accurately.,1205648,-1,8074
The writeup clearly explains the problem statement,1206194,-1,8074
The test plan is not added as the part of writeup,1206196,-1,8074
"several methods are missing in the document and the rspec file like review_response_report, import. ",1207676,1,8074
Test Plan is missing,1207678,1,8074
"some branches are skipped by the ""allow"" statement. If a method would raise an exception, then test whether it would raise it. ",1207685,1,8074
No details about what was changed only details related to already existing implementation has been stated.,1208137,1,8074
The approach taken by the team to increase the code coverage has not been clearly stated. Also there is no mention about what was the existing code coverage and how much did the team increase it to?,1208139,1,8074
"This is semi-passable. The wiki is hosted on Wikipedia, so they clearly didn't read the directions. I mean, I get it, though. I wrote tests, and was also unclear about what exactly the Wiki should contain.",1208220,1,8074
" They wrote the literal least possible, but again, I get it. Learning how to test with doubles, mocks, stubs, and spies, to peek in on the innards of a high complexity OO system was actually really difficult.",1208221,1,8074
"This is not a fair ask. As far as I can tell, there is no document that says we should create a test plan.",1208223,-1,8074
It looks like if they fix some style issues then it could increase the code coverage. I don't understand why their last unit test does not pass though.  ,1208227,1,8074
"All of the code appears to be above board, and no functions are overly long. The test did take like 28 seconds to run, which seems like a lot.",1208228,1,8074
"No Test Plan was included. The bare minimum of description was given for each test, and the project preamble. As far as I can tell, though, there is no document that says we should have created a Test Plan, and I bet it is safe to say that their mentor did not suggest creating a Test Plan either.",1208229,1,8074
"Source code is good in all spots, except the last unit test. I was unable to figure out why it did not work.",1208230,1,8074
"They don not have any test plan, and some functionality of code is not adequate for the test.",1209109,1,8074
"Yes they have explained the way and why they did, and in their writeup, they does not mention any principles or patterns.",1209110,1,8074
They don not have a test plan.,1209112,1,8074
"Their variables, methods, and class names are good ",1209116,-1,8074
Some of the functions are too long such as #delete function.,1209117,1,8074
"No, they did write the test plan.",1209118,1,8074
"Yes their code works, and some edge cases are also correct.",1209119,-1,8074
The team has not added any test cases.,1202492,1,8021
No new tests have been written,1204724,1,8021
No test cases / Test plans,1207566,1,8021
"Unfortunately, the test cases are lacking This could be improved before the second submission",1208016,1,8021
There is no Test plan.,1203875,1,8021
Test cases are not being taken cared.,1205985,1,8021
All the variables and function names used are appropriate. ,1202490,-1,8021
"The variables, names are well assigned.",1208687,-1,8021
"There a large set of variables that do not follow typical ruby naming convention. An example is that ""existAssignment"" should be ""exit_assignment"". Additionally, some names are not very helpful. For instance, the variable ""frm"" is used for a form, but why not just use ""form""? There is also a lot of javascript written directly on the page and are difficult to read and understand as there is missing method names or other non-intuitive variable names",1208097,1,8021
"The code is clear and concise. The variable, method and class name choice is correct.  One variable i feel can be changed is  top_max_choosers can be renamed to topic_max_slots, as slots has been used in the function name as well and it will be more consisted  ",1204722,1,8021
"For the Ruby changes they have made, they have used intuitive names and used naming conventions as much as possible. def update_feedback   Some places, the variable names are used in CamelCase whereas few places they werent used. Few variable names were directly used from legacy code, although refactoring could have been done. curquestionnaire quesparams . questArray",1207564,1,8021
"Most of the variable names and function names are named based on proper convention. Suggestion: function addCreateTopicSection()This function name could be changed to maybe CreateTopic() or AddTopic()Apart form this, all other names look good",1208014,1,8021
"All the variables are defined with respect to the functionality like - max_team_size, get_participants_without_team.",1203873,-1,8021
Functions and variables are named aptly,1205449,-1,8021
Ruby coding standard has been followed. Only one function has been added in controller as per requirement. Code follows DRY principle. The team can add comments for the code added which would be useful to understand the code.,1202491,1,8021
"This team used migrations effectively, and generally had DRY code, but it still felt very ad-hoc. I couldn't find any patterns that drove the changes they made.",1208098,-1,8021
"def create function in assignments controller seems to be long and could have been refactored. Considering that they used most of the legacy code and most of their work was on UI, their part on ruby changes werent much ",1207565,1,8021
"The team has written a concise and efficient code with proper implementation. However, some additional comments in some parts would improve the readability and make it easier to comprehend",1208015,1,8021
The code is well structured. Could have added more comments for easy understanding of the code. The functions are not long.,1203874,-1,8021
"Functions are of appropriate length and code is in proper methods. However, no comments are provided what so ever.  ",1205450,-1,8021
"The group has not shared the link for the test environment. Hence unable to test the edge cases. However, in the screen cast they have covered the functionalities mentioned in the requirement document.",1202493,1,8021
I have not been supplied with a link to manually use an instance with their changes and I have not been able to find a link in their PR or write-up.,1208100,-1,8021
I could not run it locally and hence I am not sure about the edge cases. Code looks clean and should not break in most of the cases,1204725,-1,8021
"The youtube screenshare clearly shows the changes made and works perfectly. Since the edge cases arent defined, not sure about the functionalities of edge cases in this case as it involves UI most of the time",1207567,-1,8021
"There is no link provided to test the code manually. However from the video provided, I can infer that all the features have been implemented and are working properly. Issue #718 and #926 are working as expected. In issue #971, I could see that the previous version of the 'add new topic' page had a topic description and topic category field which is not seen in the updated version. Suggestion: The team could implement that or if already implemented, add that to the wiki page to reflect the way in which that is handled",1208017,1,8021
The features work as intended. Edge cases are properly executed.  ,1203876,-1,8021
The code works.,1205452,-1,8021
"No deployment is provided, so couldn't test manually. ",1205986,-1,8021
The write up addresses details of all the three problem statements along with the code changes done in every file and the files added. The team has also added screenshots of the manual testing and the video demonstrating the functionality they added.,1202483,-1,8021
"The write up covers all the issues and is well organized, including the code blocks and the screenshots.",1208680,-1,8021
"I was able to understand the changes they were making and why, however I thought the write-up was a little too verbose and had too much code - I can find the code in their PR.",1208090,1,8021
The Documentation is well written and indicated clearly what was the problem tackled and how it was approached and solved,1204715,-1,8021
"The writeup s format on how they distinguished the features and explained solutions for each and everything is good. First they give a bird's eye view of the problems and then deep diving into each problem with solution and screenshot is good. The background explanation given could have been more specific towards their problem statement, rather than just about expertiza. The images tend to occupy the entire page and its little difficult while going through it, a little foramatting could have made their page really good.",1207557,1,8021
"Yes, the team has clearly stated the problem statement and the changes they have done to provide solutions to the problem. They have been given 3 problems to which they have clearly provided the names of the files and the part of the code which is changed. The video explains the problem and the implemented solution perfectly without any ambiguity.",1208007,-1,8021
The write up clearly explains about the modifications made in Expertiza.  It indicates the functionality of their work which is topic management and the problem statement is clearly elaborated. It provides the files changed and also the code snippets in which the changes are made. The write up also provides visual representations of the changes made. ,1203866,-1,8021
"writeup is very well written, contains enough screenshots and explanations of the code.",1205442,-1,8021
The write-up is well explained but could have described more on the methods whey implemented and why did it implement in a certain way.,1205976,-1,8021
The team has not included any test cases. It would be easy to include the test cases on the  app/controllers/suggestion_controller for the update_feedback method that has been added. Also the team may add some features test cases as most of the changes made are in html files. The team can refer the existing features present in the .spec/features folder.,1202486,1,8021
"There is no explicit test plan section, but all the scenarios are covered with appropriate images.",1208683,1,8021
Text Plan is Missing,1204718,1,8021
There was no Test Plan,1207560,1,8021
"The writeup does not include the test plan as of now, but that is the only thing which is left for the team to complete. The team could work on this and try to improve the test coverage.",1208010,1,8021
There is no test plan.,1203869,1,8021
No test cases or test plan mentioned in the write-up.,1205979,1,8021
The team has explained the issue and the solution they chose with enough details to understand to way of implementation.,1202484,-1,8021
"They explained it well, but there were no larger design patterns they seemed to be following. I did think that they used AJAX in the appropriate way, but it could be improved in the future.",1208091,-1,8021
"Their solutions are well explained. The way they have explained, attaching a screenshot of a code snippet and telling, this is where we made this change, and this is how it works, gives a better understanding of their project. It could have been better if they could have compare and contrasted the previous codes, where the features where not there. That way, the background of the why this feature could have been clear.",1207558,-1,8021
"Yes, the team has explained their code and the reason for the additions made. However, for the issue #926, some more information about the Tablesorter and some additional comments would improve the writeup. Solutions to issue #718 and #971 are explained clearly and are easy to follow.",1208008,1,8021
Design patterns were not used. Rest of the code is explained and easy to follow.,1203867,1,8021
"Writeup explains what was to be done and how they did it, but does not give rationale behind the way they coded, and any alternative approaches.",1205443,-1,8021
Code snippets are given but need explanation. ,1205977,-1,8021
All the cases discussed in the test plan have been implemented.,1207609,-1,8029
they have done all the 29 test case and test them throughly.,1206399,-1,8029
The team has tested all the methods of the corresponding model file.,1206109,-1,8029
Well done in achieving 100% test coverage and passing all the tests.,1204147,-1,8029
Yes they have converted them.,1203823,-1,8029
work as intended to be ,1205715,-1,8029
Code style seems to be good.,1207607,-1,8029
Not find any improper variable names or method names.  ,1206397,-1,8029
"Names for variables, classes, and method are properly named and make sense",1203588,-1,8029
The test coverage has increased significantly from like one test to 100%. Kudos to the team!! The team's pull request hasn't passed due to inconsistencies in following Ruby styling guidelines.,1206107,-1,8029
Proper naming conventions are followed for variables and methods and classes. The only thing I think can be improved is dummy names for files and hyperlinks.,1203821,1,8029
"The code is DRY enough, and the functions seem to be compact.",1207608,-1,8029
"There are some duplicate codes could substitute with ""before"" statement. For example, line 100 are exactly the same with line 108, it is better to use ""before"" even if there is only one line duplicate.  ",1206398,1,8029
This was a testing project and the mocked objects were appropriate,1203589,-1,8029
The code is DRY. There is no redundancy in the code.,1206108,-1,8029
Overall the team has done good job in maintaining Ruby Style guide. The team could add more comments and reduce code redundancy in scores() method.,1204146,1,8029
All the codes are of perfect length. That is actually one of the best thing about the code. It follows basic ruby style guide.,1203822,-1,8029
Code climate issues that were reported have been fixed.,1208314,-1,8029
"The features work as intended, they cover the test cases and edge cases as well.",1207610,-1,8029
All tests works fine. ,1206400,-1,8029
It's a testing project and the video provided show that all test pass and they have at least 90% coverage,1203591,-1,8029
The test cases are working. The coverage also as i can see is 100%.  I could find only one test for which the edge case failed.,1203824,1,8029
"The Wiki has all the relevant information though I feel it needs to be a bit more organized. The titles and order need to change. The content needs to be placed at proper places. For example, test plan lists all the test cases and code, which according to me should be covered in the implementation.",1207600,1,8029
"The wiki talk about what they have done throughly, it could be better if they have mention about how they do that. ",1206390,1,8029
This wiki is very detailed and explains what is done for every tested method,1203581,-1,8029
The write up is descriptive and very well written. I could easily understand everything about this project. Good job! ,1208184,-1,8029
From the document I could understand the functionality on which the tests were written.,1206100,-1,8029
"The writeup describes briefly and clearly what the AssignmentTeam class does in the expertiza project. It has also given the details on the test plan, test cases and explained the use of RSpec testing framework and factories. I would suggest to add a link to their video that shows the tests running in the wiki page. All in all good work!",1204138,-1,8029
The tests are very well written. They clearly indicate what functionality they are checking for.  The tests follow a language that is easy to follow.,1203814,-1,8029
The writeup matches up very well with tests written and also describes in details what scenarios are tested.,1208306,-1,8029
"yes, very clear",1205706,-1,8029
"The test plan is too elaborate and doesn't exactly cover different pre-conditions, edge cases, invalid input values, and other possibilities under the corresponding headers. Please include this as it improves the readablity and understanding.",1207603,1,8029
"Yes the Test Plan part is pretty through, they list all 29 test case they have done for the assignment_team.rb.",1206393,-1,8029
They have a very detailed Test Plan section where they explain every method and what  they did. They don't talk about pre condition or edge cases or invalid input or things like that ,1203584,1,8029
"The test plan seems to include examples of tests and the explanation of the same. However, I didn't find any description of edge cases or invalid input values.",1206103,1,8029
The Test Plan is detailed and comprehensive. Good job!,1204141,-1,8029
"The test plan section is really well written. However, pre conditions , edge cases are not very well discussed and talked about.",1203817,1,8029
no miss,1205709,-1,8029
"I feel that they have achieved a 100% test coverage, although the design principles or patterns used haven't been listed. Listing that would help understand the testing strategy used.",1207601,1,8029
"Since it's a test project, there are not much design patterns to follow, but they should list what tech they used to test the rb file.",1206391,1,8029
"For every tested method, they explain why they created certain objects or did what they did",1203582,-1,8029
The writeup explains well the plan of work of the authors and the way in which they approached the task at hand.,1206101,-1,8029
The authors mention that they have followed DRY Testing practices but there are few test cases where they have not  implemented it. For example scores(questions) method. I would recommend to make the use of factories. Overall well written test cases.  ,1204139,1,8029
"The writeup is really nicely written. It clearly mentions the work done. However, the problem statement could have been explained a little more.",1203815,1,8029
Appropriate explanations are provided for the tests.,1208307,-1,8029
"As mentioned earlier, they have not considered testing at all at this point and hence, we are assuming that they are to implement testing at a further point in the project. Of course, mentioning an approach to the testing framework and how they would be going about it would have helped. ",1206609,1,8039
No test cases explained. ,1208889,0,8039
There were no test cases in the pull request,1207497,1,8039
There were no testcases and since they provided a screenshot of the desired work. I suppose it fulfills the requirement,1206339,-1,8039
"Few new names were added, and they look fine.",1204069,-1,8039
"Yes, on manual testing, it leads to realization that the code has been suitably written as required by the functionalities and also the doc they have provided is the results that I get on following the procedure. Although, I would suggest that they look more into the test case 3 because how to go about testing it hasn't been explained by them. ",1206610,-1,8039
The functionality works as explained in the design document. ,1208890,-1,8039
"Although their documentation shows screenshots and their app is deployed on VCL, there was no testing plan/ how to test on application. There was no screencast too. So it poses a difficulty on how to see. But from the screenshots on the documentation, the features seem to work good.",1207498,1,8039
"The menu which they emphasized on, seems complete and running",1206340,-1,8039
The write up is very well detailed with good information and pictures. Two things: 1. Put the write up on the expertiza wiki page instead of in a word document 2. On the wiki use the   tag to insert code snippets into the page instead of a screenshot of the code,1204695,1,8039
"I thought the write-up was clear and had proper instructions and screenshots. However, the write-up was not in the wikki but in a word file",1205841,1,8039
The documentation is good but is missing the test plan and Instead of a word document write it on wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu so its easier to search and refer.  ,1205242,1,8039
The writeup is extremely clear. I understand each issue they address.,1204062,-1,8039
"Yes, the team has taken care of it by specially making a section of ""what it does"" as the introductory section of the doc so as to make us understand the goals of the project. They have even attached screenshots of the relevant changes they have in mind whilst explaining the error. Although, one questions the details in which they should have gone into explaining the errors and resolution. More mentioning of details is required. ",1206600,1,8039
"The write up is written with enough explanation. The headings shows clearly what the project is about and what kind of solution they have proposed. The solution is shown with code snippets and functionality changes, this gives further information to understand the proposed solution. ",1208880,-1,8039
"They have neatly organised the solution by the each problem, the solution they provided and the screenshots of output which is useful in testing. They have highlighted the changes and explained where exactly the change has been proposed(down to the granularity level of each function call and each line) which gives a clear idea of the code. I can clearly see what the problem is and functionality the work is related to.",1207488,-1,8039
They have not created a wiki page but uploaded a doc file which explains the work they have done adequately,1206330,1,8039
"Great writup which contains all cases the task required, and it's easy to understand since there are lots of screenshots to explain their task clearly.",1208256,-1,8039
There was not an explicit test plan. Your design looks good though,1204698,1,8039
"I did not see a test plan per se, but they did include examples of the scenarios there code was solving.",1205844,1,8039
No test plan section in writeup. It doesn't appear as though the repository updated the team_spec.rb file either.,1204065,1,8039
"Unfortunately, no mention of the word ""test plan"" has even taken place in their whole doc. So, it seems that they are yet to implement the testing functionalities in their project. Although, it would have been better if they had checked if the checks or the tests already existed in the first place in the git repository.  ",1206603,1,8039
There is no test plan. ,1208883,1,8039
There are no test plans in the documentation,1207491,1,8039
No test plan included but I feel that wasnt needed.,1206333,-1,8039
"Design principles were not discussed. They did discussed the general approach, but that approach did not seem to be rooted in design principles.",1205842,1,8039
The code is simple and easy to understand. There are a lot of code climate suggested changes which needs to be completed before the code will be ready to merge  ,1205243,-1,8039
"The authors do a great job of explaining how they did their work, and but the why is sometimes not explained. That could be because it's largely self-explanatory.",1204063,1,8039
"Yes, they surely have done a good job in mentioning the errors in the 1st part and the second part. But it is unclear why the 3rd fix is a problem or how they have combatted the 3rd fix in the first place. It just seems so that a screen shot has been put into place and they displayed a No Method Error popup. They have vaguely described the handling of the same, but doubts remain in the details or the changes in the code. In fact, no code screenshots have been put up for this case. ",1206601,1,8039
Although the write up has all the details about how the work has been done and what solutions are proposed. There are no explanation about design principles. ,1208881,1,8039
"Yes, they have explained why they did that way and it was clear. They have compared and contrasted in each of their feature of ""Current Implementation"" and ""Solution"" which is a better way of showing what they implemented One more suggestion would be, it would have been good if they showed the difference in their code snippets too for the current implementation vs Solution proposed.",1207489,1,8039
"Yes, the work is explained mentioning all the details",1206331,-1,8039
"Of course, they lay all various details and highlight them using orange-box which is easier to understand.",1208257,-1,8039
The test plan was not present. But the team have done a good job in implementing tests.,1208646,1,8032
"The description for the first issue is confusing, I am not very sure about what the function of the old version looks like. I am not sure what mean by the instructor under the instructor.",1204652,1,8024
The team has leveraged the existing test cases to align with the changes implemented; they have not created any test plan.,1202516,1,8032
All the test cases are passing however code coverage is low. Various different scenarios must be tested thoroughly. Travis CI build is passing and efforts were taken to work on this. Appreciated!,1208841,1,8032
"A few tests were added, though I'd like to see more tests regarding edge cases or invalid functionality. ",1203153,1,8032
"Yes, very well done on adding tests. ",1204311,-1,8032
The variable and method names are apt.,1208644,-1,8032
Too long if statements are  written.,1206301,1,8032
"The team has followed Ruby coding standard. However, function names could be refactored for example the function ""get_time_diff_btw_due_date_and_now"" name is just too long and can be modified into ""get_time_diff"" or any other meaningful name. Also, it is advisable to keep the function name singular or append the name with list; so instead of using ""find_participant_emails"" the team can use ""find_participant_email_list"".",1202514,1,8032
Test cases not passed,1205213,1,8032
The write up is well formed and structured. The entire flow is explained along with files changed/methods implemented in each stage. Could have described the approach a bit more.,1208839,-1,8032
Code convention for mail looks good but I found find_participant_emails misleading because it gets email for all participants and not emails for participant,1204309,1,8032
The code follows the DRY principle.,1208645,-1,8032
more comments are needed for clearity .,1206302,1,8032
"The code has been implemented in a modular fashion. However, the team can improve the readability of the code in mail_worker  and assignment_form. Currently it lacks readability because of too long comments between every line of code and poor alignment, which makes it difficult for user to understand.",1202515,1,8032
"At several places, the code used a lot of nested if else statements and some methods were very long. These lines could have been refactored. Also more comments are needed that explain what a method/variable does (just good naming is not enough). The code is DRY compliant and follows style pattern well.",1208840,1,8032
There are some style issues related to spacing and unnecessary parenthesis. ,1203152,1,8032
Function length is good. General convention of having function length < 20 has been followed. What I found lacking was additional 2-3 lines of comments before each new function to understand what has been implemented.     ,1204310,1,8032
They do work as intended.,1208647,-1,8032
The issues in the code has been resolved. But the wiki only addresses the technical changes done. It does not address the functionality details; which makes it difficult for the end user to test all edge cases. The project deals with the emails which can only be tested in production and not in test environment by any end user.,1202517,1,8032
The authors work functions well but the code uses redundant/bad logic in some places. Code could have been put into methods and reused. The code functions as expected in almost all cases,1208842,1,8032
Did not find any problematic edge cases.,1203154,-1,8032
Yes features work as intended but I would like to see tests as well as testing case were job addition to queue fails. I understand this would be edge case and not likely to happen but still needs to be handled. Other edge cases such as participant_mails is nil have been taken care of.  ,1204312,1,8032
The team have done a good job in explaining their work.,1208637,-1,8032
the related functionality is mentioned.,1206294,-1,8032
"The wiki as well as a design document has been created for the write up which explains the refactoring requirements. The team has explained the technical aspects in a very detailed manner. However, it would be helpful for users if the team could add more details about the functional aspects so that a end user can test the impact on the existing functionality due to the changes done.",1202507,-1,8032
The method names and variable names are very well defined ! The best I have seen so far ! No clear explanation is given as to which files are edited for which reason. Only file names are stated along with changes made. Why the changes were made and what do those changes correct is not given.,1208832,1,8032
Perfectly explained write up along with the design document to get the better understanding of the issues and flow.,1205766,-1,8032
"Write is clear and well written, a trivial formatting mistake ( new implementation bullets ) but that is fine.  Problem statement is well define and the existing solution too. Problem statement does not need to state that RSpec tests have been added.    ",1204302,-1,8032
The test plan is not present.,1208640,1,8032
nothing mentioned about test plan only snapshot provided.,1206297,1,8032
The team has leveraged the existing test cases to align with the changes implemented. It would have been more helpful to include the test cases in the write up as well.,1202510,-1,8032
Test cases are failed,1205209,1,8032
The tests look detailed and clear. However no edge cases or failing cases are tried. Simple and straightforward  tests are implemented. They could have tried more corner scenarios more..eg. fields are missing etc,1208835,1,8032
No test plan is included. Testing is mentioned briefly but does not mention what tests were added.,1203147,1,8032
Need to include a test plan,1205769,1,8032
Existing tests have been modified to changed to pass for the new implementation.  News tests could have been added ,1204305,-1,8032
The team have explained why and how they did the work they did. Feel they should elaborate more on the tests that they have implemented.,1208638,1,8032
writeup explains in  brief how and why the functionality of sidekiq was implemented.,1206295,-1,8032
The wiki has been documented with a lot of details explaining the problem statement as well as the approach.,1202508,-1,8032
No mention is made as to why the changes were made in which specific files.  The code is well written but hard to follow (what is the functionality of the code is tough to decipher). It would have been better had there been some comments or documentation as to what those respective methods do.,1208833,1,8032
Yes the authors explain the existing solution and explain the drawbacks for in them.  I would have liked to see a point wise comparison on how their solution overcomes the existing drawbacks.  I would suggest not to hard code the mail text/subject in the code and use a config file instead. This will be easy to modify in future. I would have liked if the authors added why they took sidekiq and not rabbitmq or celery  ,1204303,-1,8032
Test plan looks very generic.,1206517,1,8075
Test plan is given a appreciable thought and team has also implemented test scenarios mainly in student_task_controller_spec.rb Would suggest team to try and increase test coverage.,1206169,1,8075
Good work on including test cases.,1203109,-1,8075
Though the authors have included a thorough testing plan Inside the commits I couldn't find any commits for adding testing files. they could have added basic UI testing using Capybara and cucumber.,1207473,1,8075
Both the specs fails spec/controllers/student_task_controller_spec.rb fails spec/features/airbrake_expection_errors_feature_tests_spec.rb  ,1203811,1,8075
Couldn't see any testing being done.,1204914,1,8075
The test plan needs to be significantly improved.,1205407,1,8075
The pull request link is not provided to verify the tests.,1208791,1,8075
"I could only see 3 commits with no significant file changes. I would request team to add and contribute the changes as soon as possible. With the present changed code, methods names and variables and class names are proper with reasonable naming conventions.",1206167,1,8075
Link to the pull request is missing. Please add it.,1203107,1,8075
"The variables, methods, and class names do seem to follow proper convention and are suggestive of the functionality they are being used for. In some cases they could have used a liitle more desciptive names for variables for example inside app/helpers/student_task_helper.rb  they could have used background_colour instead of rtn as a variable name in the due_date_color() method. It will become more readable for the reviewers to understand the functionalities.",1207471,1,8075
"@all_task vs @student_tasks    The name 'all_task' does not sound appropriate. It should be student_all_tasks.   1. all_tasks => student_all_tasks   2. student_tasks => student_available_tasks   3. current_student_tasks => student_current_tasks 4. past_student_tasks => student_past_tasks     Also, the filename will_paginate_array_fix.rb seems misleading to me. A better name would have been support_array_pagination.rb.   Also, I am not sure this file should be in the initializers, as it is just a require statement. May be this should be included in the places where the pagination is required, instead of loading it during app initialization.       ",1203809,1,8075
"No pull request has been created as I can see from the link provided. The commits have been made, though. I think they are just one step behind creating a PR. Some variables like, @students_teamed_with, seemed ambiguous as to what do they represent.",1204912,1,8075
"The variables, methods and classnames are aptly named. I could not find names which are not suggestive of functionaliy.",1205405,-1,8075
The code changes are well organized and nothing is out of place.,1208792,-1,8075
Pull request not created / link to pull request is not found in this submission.,1206516,1,8075
I could see commit performed by only single team member. 1. Functions are not too long or repeatative. 2. No code needs to be extracted as a new function. 3. Yes team need to add more comments. 4. Team does follow Ruby style guide. 5. Team understood rails and followed DRY principle well.  ,1206168,1,8075
In due_date_color switch case would have been a better approach then if else if block. Lots of code that is done in view can be moved to the controller. Follow MVC architecture. ,1203108,1,8075
 The functions seem to be implemented in a good manner and the code seems to be DRY.. In some cases though the authors could have improved as in the i app/helpers/student_task_helper.rb  file. In side the due_date_color method they could have used case expressions in Ruby instead of the if else logic implemented as that would be a more Ruby on Rails way of doing it. As it will reduce the lines of code as well as being a more elegant way of handling it.,1207472,1,8075
"In the due_date_color(due_date), instead of hardcoding the color vs interval, it would have been more useful if those are pulled from a config file. That will make the implementation more flexible   Similar hardcoding found in  1. list_student_tasks: per_page: 10 2. breaking_word_wrap: breaking_word_wrap(student_task.assignment.name,40 )     Use of inline CSS element, could have avoided by using a simple css class. Such harcoded stuffs make the view strongly coupled with the style elements, which could have been avoided. <hr style=""height:2px;border:none;color:#e3e3e3;background-color:#e3e3e3;""   Also, the UI changes are not showing up properly aligned. Please see the attached screenshot  ",1203810,1,8075
I feel some comments can be added before every function for the code to be understood better.,1204913,1,8075
"1. Functions are of appropriate length 2. Codes are in approriate methods 3. Code is very well commented. Overall, great work.",1205406,-1,8075
Not possible to test - neither a deployment nor screenshots provided.,1206518,1,8075
Can not find any video or link or Ip address link to manually test the changes. I would request team to deploy the changes so that we can test the system partially.,1206170,1,8075
Can't test as the link to the deployed application is not given nor the screencast video link is provided. Please include either of them.,1203110,1,8075
the features added seem to be running good .,1207474,-1,8075
"Student dashboard   Please see the dashboard. The UI elements are not properly aligned. The title ""Current Assignments"" is not where it should be. ",1203812,1,8075
Couldn't test it manually as no link/guide provided for the same.,1204915,1,8075
The code works as it should.,1205408,-1,8075
Whether the task is due is determined by a date str and it may be go wrong under different timezone.,1208029,1,8075
Thee writeup page is concise and easy to understand but there is no insight into the code.,1208784,1,8075
Screenshots are missing under Test Plan section.,1206508,1,8075
Writeup is readable and written properly. Team could have added code snippet and pictures of changed or improved functionality. Also team could work upon formatting and could also add links and references.,1206160,1,8075
"Please include the code snippet that was changed and also a screenshot of the view before and after the change.  Also, Please provide the link to the pull request and not the repo created. Good written explanation of the changes done in WIKI.",1203100,1,8075
The wiki documentation has been updated. All the information has been documented in a neat and logical manner. The write up adequately provides what functionality the work is related to. The project changes to the code have been described in paragraphs which could have been better if they could have updated with code snippets and screen shots of the tasks at hand.,1207464,-1,8075
"Wiki has been well written, with enough clarity and description",1203802,-1,8075
It is clear what the project does and why it does it.,1204905,-1,8075
The writeup is clear. It is easy to understand what the project does. It would be better if you can put in more code details and major pieces that do the important logic.,1205398,1,8075
The writeup is pretty clear.,1204290,-1,8075
"The test plan section is present, and it is covering all the scenarios.",1208787,-1,8075
"Wiki page does talk about test plan. But it is explained in brief, but no details of test scenarios or testing technology to be used.  ",1206163,1,8075
Few test cases are missing context and it block so it is difficult to understand what the test case is doing unless you read the entire code.,1203103,1,8075
They seem to have included a testing plan have mentioned it in their report. They seem to have considered edge cases and other possibilities.,1207467,-1,8075
"I could think of 1 missing test case, where an assignment due date changes from future to past, that assignment should now appear in the past assignment section,   apart from this test case, all edge cases have been covered.",1203805,1,8075
"Not much has been explained about the test plan. The authors have, however, explained how they will be going about the testing in general. An overview is provided which is clear to understand.",1204908,1,8075
"It feels like test plan only covers one aspect - ""changing of the background color for tasks as we approach the deadline.""   here are other aspects which can be automated for testing, perhaps by Rspec or the likes:  Add past due assignments to the students task list (on Student View). -- Verify if they are being added/saved Check for correction in due dates of assignments (when an assignments due date is edited, it should be appropriately moved from the Past assignments list to the Current Assignments list if needed) --- Check if the functionality works. On Student Task page, separate the list of 'teamed with' students from the current tasks box. -- test if this works Write the required tests before implementing/refactoring the methods in the above-mentioned classe ",1205401,1,8075
"More details are expected in the Test Plan like edge cases, normal cases.",1208022,1,8075
There is no edge case.,1204293,1,8075
The writeup explains everything regarding why and how the steps were carried out.,1208785,1,8075
"Yes, Writeup explains the approach taken by team to solve the issue, theoretically. Team could have explained the issues and resolution practically. Also no design pattern or principle were used.",1206161,1,8075
It only explains how they did but not why they did. The various approach could have been mentioned in the WIKI.,1203101,1,8075
The authors have documented the steps they did to solve the issues. Although they haven't mentioned any particular design principles or design thinking that went on in solving the issues. They should have  explained all the functionalities of each file they have modified and stated why they have modified the particular file. One thing they could have added were class diagrams and dependency maps. Or some pictorial representation of the flow of each task which will help the reviewers and instructors to quickly catch up on their idea.,1207465,1,8075
"Wiki has been well written, with enough clarity and description",1203803,-1,8075
They have explained how they have implemented each task by adding/editing files.,1204906,-1,8075
"The writeup only tells what is to be done and how it is done. The rational behind choosing the approach is not mentioned, neither are any of the principles mentioned.",1205399,1,8075

"Yes, the writeup explains what the authors did.",1204291,-1,8075
I do not see any changes made to the spec folder in this repo so it would appear no tests have been written.,1204673,1,8031
Could not find any test cases. The team should implement test cases for the issues they've fixed.,1208658,1,8031
 They did not do any automated tests.    ,1205961,1,8031
The code is not commented which they can for future developers to understand better. ,1205355,1,8031
There were no test files added in the pull request,1207764,1,8031
There is no automated tests about the test plan were found. It seems the tests were all done by themselves.,1204685,1,8031
Mostly looks good. Can change names like this is_selfreview_enabled to is_self_review_enabled and assignment_form_assignment_num_metareviews_allowed to assignment_form_assignment_num_meta_reviews_allowed. selfreview shouldn't be a single string.,1205353,-1,8031
I couldn't get it to build but because rails repeatedly failed to find the config.yml. I don't think this is your fault,1204671,1,8031
The code seems to have been well written with the reasonable variable names.,1208656,-1,8031
 Their code is clear and reasonable.    ,1205959,-1,8031
The code changes are majorly html changes and not Ruby changes,1207762,-1,8031

"The team should give more comments for the review strategy part, especially for the ruby codes part to help viewers understand what is going on.",1204684,1,8031
 Maybe some more comments will be helpful.    ,1205960,-1,8031
Its nicely written and follows dry principle. They have used existing functions where required.,1205354,-1,8031
The code changes are majorly html changes and not Ruby changes The DRY principle explained in the document is clear and talks about DRY being handled,1207763,-1,8031
The code is well written and follows DRY principle.,1208657,-1,8031
The features seem to work well,1208659,-1,8031
"They haven't deployed it but have shown in the video and documentation the edge cases, so i think it might just work.",1205356,-1,8031

"They did not deploy their code on a server so I cannot test it manually. However, they upload a video about their work and all the function seems work well.",1205962,1,8031
The codes work well as the team described in wiki.,1204686,-1,8031

"They have explained every aspect of the project really well. Plus the video also show the changes they have done. One thing you can add is audio in your screencast videos, telling what is being done so that its easy for the user to understand.",1205346,-1,8031
"The team gave clear explanation of what functions include in this project. Besides, they gave some examples to help us to understand how the functions work and should work in the system , so I can point out the issue easily by following their instruction.",1204676,1,8031
 They explained the problem very well.    ,1205952,-1,8031
The test plan seems to be good as they've included test plan for every issue.,1208652,-1,8031
Good detail covering how you test different issues in the code.,1204667,-1,8031
"The test plan has covered various cases and completely explainable in simple terms Small suggestion, The first paragraph could have been itemized for easier understanding.",1207758,-1,8031
Yes they have explained everything in detail.,1205349,-1,8031
 They showed their work with screenshots which contain some edge cases.    ,1205955,-1,8031
"For the first two issues, the team gave different conditions but no codes or demos are presented in the wiki for this test, I can only know the results by the description.

"Yes, The authors have done a great job in explaining their work with code snippets.",1208650,-1,8031
Good job explaining your work and talking about staying dry.,1204665,-1,8031
They have discussed everything. The way they have split the features and explained it one by one with the code is good.,1207756,-1,8031
They have explained everything nicely. I don't think any specific design pattern needs to be followed here and they have mentioned as well that they are not following any as such.,1205347,-1,8031
 They explained what design pattern they use but not how they use them.    ,1205953,1,8031
The overall structure of the code looks good and all the coding standards have been followed.,1213833,-1,8031

"Naming is good. There are few names(eg. is_selfreview_enabled ) which don't seem fine but they were from before, any thing new that has been added by them follows proper naming convention.",1212046,1,8031
 I think their code is well written.   ,1213959,-1,8031
No new code was committed during the second round. This could be due to the fact that the team finished their code at the end of the first round itself.,1213834,-1,8031
No new commits.,1213114,-1,8031
"The code has almost no comments. I found some lint, particularly some commented-out blocks of code. ",1214037,1,8171
"Code looks good apart from a lot of commented code. If that is written by the team and was not already present, then it should be removed if not used before submitting pull requests.",1212802,1,8171

"In the first round the team had only created the two Web IDL  files namely OffScreenCanvas.webidl and OffScreenCanvasRenderingContext2D.webidl; which are the interface files which define the implementation in the corresponding files offscreencanvas.rs and offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs. In this round the team has implemented the functionalities described in the two Web IDL files in offscreencanvas.rs and offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs. The offscreencanvas.rs interacts with the javascript and hence has the constructor with attributes height and width; a method getContext() to return the reference to OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2d; and a reflector object for garbage collection. The offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs file does not interact directly with Javascript and does not have a constructor or reflector object. It has the code to build the offscreencanvas object.  On inspection, the variable and method names used in the code are intuitive. But the main issue is that the name of the webidl file OffScreenCanvasRenderingContext2D.webidl and corresponding Rust file offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs don't match. The team could have formatted the code appropriately for readable indentation. There are not many comments that give a high level description of the code. Instead there are some instances of unnecessary code that has been commented. The code is indeed DRY.",1212179,-1,8171
"No new commits made during the second round, as the functionality seems completed in the first round itself.",1213904,-1,8031
There is no new commits during the 2nd round.,1212852,-1,8031
"The code seems to be good. It follows the principle of good design. Even though I do not know RUST, the use of variable names was very intuitive.",1213211,-1,8171
"The code is very well written, there are no bad names or long and complicated functions. However, there are no proper comments that have been provided for the viewers understanding. One suggestion would be to include some comments for better understanding.",1212109,1,8171
"The code doesn't make sense to me, someone who isn't familiar with this project, but it does seem to be formatted well.",1212207,-1,8171
Could not find any test cases. The team seem to have made changes to only the views. The team should implement test cases for the issues they've fixed.,1213836,1,8031
There are only minor modifications and they are well written. I don't think there is any other way it could be done. ,1213204,-1,8072
The code changes are majorly on html files. Capybara could have been used to test the functionalities The code coverage has increased overall.,1213116,-1,8031
 There is no new test and the coverage did not increase.   ,1213962,-1,8031
"Yes, there is ",1214276,-1,8171
New code was committed but all at once on the same day.,1212803,1,8171
"Tests have been thoroughly and very well performed. Also, well documented. ",1212049,-1,8031
The code seems to be written well. The Ruby style guide is followed.,1213988,-1,8072
Team added elaborate Test plans and implementation for their test cases.,1213906,-1,8031
"The team provides some test cases, but it seems the tests were all done themselves and they didn't write codes for it and make it automatic. The test shows the feature work properly.",1212854,1,8031
Some commits were made to rectify old errors and get an approved pull request,1212356,-1,8171
There wasn't any link provided to check if the UI was working fine. But there was a video showing the project successfully running. And also the tests did seem to cover almost all the scenarios.,1213837,1,8031
The code has been modified to include the modifications requested (test cases added for failing scenarios and edge cases - two assignments with same name) in my previous review. Appreciated! Overall the code quality is good. Only some variable names are ambiguous for example: check_validate.  What does it validate? Name it like validate_same_name or validate_common_directory etc,1212683,1,8072
 Everything works like expected.   ,1213963,-1,8031
"Yes it works as intended. From the video, it seems everything is working fine.",1212050,-1,8031
"No deployment link was provided, but from the video and tests they provided, the features works as intended.",1212855,1,8031
"Yes, new code has been committed in the 2nd round. The team has essentially implemented the offscreencanvas.rs and offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs. offscreencanvas.rs is respondible for implementing the OffscreenCanvas.webidl. This interacts directly with javascript and when a new instance of offscreencanvas is created, it calls the constructor with arguments height and width which in turn calls the new method defined in this file. It also contains the reflector object that tells the Javascript garbage collector to ignore the canvas object while clearing memory. Additionally, it has the implementation of the getContext() method that returns a weak reference to OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2d, which is responsible for doing background rendering task. offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs has the implementation of OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2D. It does not interact directly with JavaScript, so it does not have the Constructor or reflector. The functionality to build an offscreencanvas object has been implemented in this file.  ",1212180,-1,8171
"Since, the git repo link of their hasn't been given it can't be certainly said how well the code has been written. But going by their video in which they have meticulously explained step by step what they have done, I would day It is reasonably well executed and follows the Ruby style conventions. ",1213043,1,8072
Yes there new commits in round 2.,1213212,-1,8171
"The writeup has been pretty well written by the team. Introduction to the problem statement, the implementation details, and the test plans have been stated.  ",1213838,-1,8031
Some small coding guideline related problems are there which can be addressed.,1211807,1,8072
"There are commits on a single day, that is yesterday. One suggestion would be to commit regular progress on the git. ",1212110,1,8171
"The writeup is accurate and sufficient, the team gives clear explanations for the whole project and the process to realize it. For the point that is not easy to understand, they provided some examples and use mathematics method to support the explantation, which makes the read easily.",1212856,-1,8031
Several new commits were added during the second round.,1212208,-1,8171
"The writeup is elaborate, well written, with proper description of the test cases with screenshots and steps for each issue.",1213908,-1,8031
" Overall, I think the write up is good and clear.   ",1213964,-1,8031
"Well documented and explained with good amount of screenshots. Also the video length has been reduced to only whatever needs to be shown, which is great.",1212051,-1,8031
The authors have improved the writeup based on the suggestions from first review.  It is more precise and self explanatory. The background is lot clear after the first review.,1213118,-1,8031
The tests were mentioned in the report but not in the pull request. There was also no coverage information. The approach looks good though.,1214040,1,8171
The team has made a great improvement with respect to the previous submission. The code is brief and easy to understand.,1212011,-1,8072
"The code is well written but it can use comments to help explain what the code is doing. For e.g. the code below is hard to understand:           if quesparams[:assignment][:directory_path] == """" and quesparams[:check_validate] == ""on""             quesparams[:assignment][:directory_path] = ""#{quesparams[:assignment][:name]}_#{quesparams[                 :assignment][:id]}_#{quesparams[:assignment][:course_id]}""           end",1211758,1,8072
I do feel the code can be deployed to the production server once a few test cases have been implemented by the team.,1213839,-1,8031
Test cases are yet to be added,1212358,-1,8171
The changes can be deployed to production server.,1213119,-1,8031
"Yes, it works as intended and code follows the ruby guidelines, the documentation is well explanatory.",1212052,-1,8031
 I think this code is ready to be deployed onto the server.   ,1213965,-1,8031
The features work properly but still need more tests to test the functions.,1212857,1,8031
"The suggestions have not been improved. Comments aren't explanatory and does not give an idea about what the author intended to do. It would be good to include meaningful comments. Debug code is still in the commit. Even though we may used debug code like the puts statement, we should not commit these as they could create junk data in the application log. Please consider removing them.",1214128,1,8072
The team have done a great job and passed all their tests.,1213835,-1,8031
The team has suggested 2 methods to test. The first and the recommended method is using the existing automated tests for OffScreenCanvas feature. A new offscreen-canvas directory was added to tests and a new .ini file enables the new preference. The second approach is writing own test cases and a sample HTML file can be used to test if the OffscreenCanvas is rendered.,1212182,-1,8171
Travis CI has passed.,1213115,-1,8031
"Every thing has passed, there is no conflict or build fail.",1212048,-1,8031
No test cases as this wasn't a testing project.,1213214,-1,8171
" Yes, the build pass in Travis CI.   ",1213961,-1,8031
The build passed with no conflicts in Travis CI.,1213905,-1,8031
The build passes,1212853,-1,8031
"In the test plan section and on Git also I found no test cases written. There is testing done, however it is not what was desired.",1212112,-1,8171
"I don't see any tests added by this team, although they do mention that their code additions were not particularly testable except with the existing automatic tests, which they enabled.",1212210,1,8171
The code was well written even in the first round.,1213246,-1,8028
"I don not think their code is good, because they did not solve the problems existing in the first round.",1214198,1,8028
The present test cases appear to be written fine.,1211557,-1,8028
"No, the authors didn't improve the code.",1212053,-1,8028
The build fails so this project will not work in its current state. There were instructions however on how to set up the project and show that it is working.,1214041,1,8171
Variable names and test cases are named appropriately. Explanation of reasons for the style of code and problem solving approach is lacking.,1214499,1,8028
Some parts of the code are still left to be implemented,1212359,1,8171
 It's fine to good. I wish y'all would have posted a link to your repo in stead of the pull request.,1213917,1,8028
To test the system operation the project has to be built and run. The Sample HTML file was used to render a Test Canvas as given in the Wiki,1212183,-1,8171
No new commits have been made in the 2nd round,1213247,0,8028
No link was given to the demo of the project.,1213215,1,8171
the latest commit is on 2nd of Nov.,1211942,1,8028
When tested the project does what was desired to be done.,1212113,-1,8171
"No, they did not commit new code.",1214199,1,8028
This system doesn't have a UI I can view as it seems to be a browser add on.,1212211,1,8171
No new commits in the second round.,1211558,1,8028
"The authors made a solid attempt at improving the writeup. However, there are still some issues. DOM was left undefined and the code was separated from the descriptions.",1214042,-1,8171
The wiki is quite comprehensive and gives the build steps clearly. It could also include a more basic explanation in layman terms about what the OffScreenCanvas API does,1212360,1,8171
"Write up is good, with code flow diagram and test plan (pull request).",1212807,-1,8171
 No new code was committed during the 2nd round of resubmission.,1213918,-1,8028
The Wiki is pretty much strong with plenty of info.,1214280,-1,8171
"Yes since it was a unit test assignment, tests have been added and overall coverage has increased",1213249,-1,8028
I cannot find any new test cases.,1211944,1,8028
"No, they did not add new test case",1214201,1,8028
"Coverage went up by 8.4%, according to coveralls.",1211560,-1,8028
"The write-up is lucid and has now incorporated the changes that were made in the round 2. It starts off by introducing Servo, Rust, OffScreenCanvas, web worker, Web IDL. The authors then describe the code flow using a flow chart which was really appealing. I especially liked the Under the hood section, which elucidated the files (OffscreenCanvas.webidl, OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2D.webidl, offscreencanvas.rs and offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs) that they modified/created in this project and their functionalities concisely. The write up then includes the code from the above four files and finally ends with the test plan with 2 approaches, links to pull request and references.",1212184,-1,8171
 No the team did not add any new test cases. Coverage is low.,1214502,1,8028
The write-up is good. I liked the use of the flow-chart to explain the flow of their code and explain the functionality. I think that this was the first write-up that used a flowchart.,1213216,-1,8171
 They added all the test cases! There is so much coverage now!,1213920,-1,8028
Overall coverage was increased by 8+ percentage. ,1212868,-1,8028
The writeup is the best part about the project. It describes clearly what and how the work is done. One can clearly understand their working strategy from the writeup.,1212114,-1,8171
"The tests cover all the scenarios. Given that the problem statement is pretty open-ended, the changes fulfil the purpose.",1213250,-1,8028
"Yes, It works .",1214202,-1,8028
"Only 34% of the lines of code in review_response_map.rb were covered, according to their video. This is much lower than the 90% required by the project descriptions.",1211561,1,8028
Not cover all the scenarios.,1212057,1,8028
" No, changes made from last review.",1214503,1,8028
"I think it covers all of the scenarios, but don't quote me. I don't have a great understanding of review response map.",1213921,-1,8028
"Although the write up clearly explains the problem statement and also contains the changes made, it doesn't include the test plan which would give a clearer picture of the changes added.",1213251,1,8028
"basically, it is good. however, i cannot find the test paln, and some explanation is not complete.",1211946,1,8028
"No, it is not good at all, they didn't explain the functionality of their test code.",1214203,1,8028
" The authors have included the different tests that they wrote, however a description of what the test is testing would be helpful.",1214504,1,8028
"Y'all did the least possible work, AND put it on wikipedia instead of the expertiza wiki.",1213922,1,8028
No test plan,1211805,1,8028
"Since it is a unit test project with well-written tests, I don't see any issues why it can't be deployed to production",1213252,-1,8028
the test examples they showed are good. ,1211947,-1,8028
"No, they code is not complete, and many cases are not covered.",1214204,1,8028
"34% is better than nothing, but it's still a far-cry from a complete unit test suite for the review_response_map model. I'd recommend it be merged, but it needs to be completed.",1211563,1,8028
"Still 25 issues, checked by codeclimate, to fix",1212059,1,8028
" The build does not pass. Also, the coverage is very low. Not many testcases.",1214505,1,8028
"It's probably fine if the integration tests can be resolved, and the code smells from code climate can be fixed.",1213923,1,8028
The biggest concern are the simple code climate issues.,1212871,1,8028
The build is passing successfully,1213248,-1,8028
"No, they did not pass Travis Ci. ",1214200,1,8028
Passed Travis but had many lingering CodeClimate failures.,1211559,1,8028
" The project does not pass the Travis CI integration tests. I looked at its output, and I cannot tell how significant the failure is. Maybe its an easy fix?",1213919,1,8028
"The reason to give 3 is that there are certain simple code climate issues regarding spaces, indentation and so. These are easy to fix and are related to code quality.",1212867,1,8028
"They have kept up to the standards of the goof coding practice , like they have given reasonable  variables names and functions name which makes it easy to understand what is the function supposed to do. However, they haven't added the comments",1213134,1,8062
There is some repetition of code but overall code quality is ok. There are some comments from the professor which should have been addressed.  ,1212837,1,8062
"There were some issues which I reported regarding comments and Notice messages displayed to User which needs to be improved. But they haven't been incorporated. It is not a blocker but definitely an important change to improve User Experience and better code readability. For example, In submitted_content controller there is a comment which says sending email to users. However it is just a method call which redirects it to delayed_mailer.rb. So this should be properly mentioned as it will be helpful for someone refactoring or understanding the code later.",1212172,1,8062
"Yes, I feel the code is written in a good format. I checked the changes made by the authors and didn't find any bad naming or anything else.",1213422,-1,8062
"The code was well-written in the first round itself. The method names, variabble names and class names are intuitive and suggestive of the functionality.",1214065,-1,8062
The code is well written. No issues with naming conventions/coding style.,1212390,-1,8062
"Impressed by the coding and the way the solution was implemented. They implemented a complex feature in simple lines of code. Coding standard has been followed, naming conventions are followed and code is formatted. ",1213698,-1,8062
The code is written really well. The professor frequently advised the team to improve the naming conventions as seen from the comments in the Pull Request. Suggestions: I still feel that the function review_reminder_email is a bit longer. ,1213536,-1,8062
yes new code was committed during the second round,1213135,-1,8062
There are 2 commits,1212838,-1,8062
No new code was committed during this review to incorporate the changes suggested,1212173,1,8062
"No, I don't find such commits during round 1.",1213423,1,8062
Two commits were done during the 2nd round.,1214066,-1,8062
2 new commits - to add additional features.,1212391,-1,8062
No new commits as fix was delivered in first round.,1213699,-1,8062
No commits were found. The last commit was 15 days back.  Suggestion: I feel that there should have been some commits as the pull request shows merge issues. The Travis CI build fails and the code climate is also not able to analyse the code. There should have been commits related to resolving these things. ,1213537,-1,8062
There is code committed during 2nd round.,1211649,-1,8062
"They have added the test cases with context as ""when participant is added to the assignment using CSV"" and the test case covers the required functionality that was intended to be  implemented",1213137,-1,8062
"Test case has been added, but Since i cannot run it locally, i am not sure if it is passing or not.",1212840,1,8062
"Team has added tests for assignment_participant model which they have changed. As the requirement was just testing one component, this is sufficient, however testing the controller would have been a more through Integration test.",1212175,-1,8062
"yes, team has added the test cases and they cover the portion tp check whether the email has been sent to or not.",1213425,-1,8062
The team has added test cases. The test coverage has increased.,1214068,-1,8062
"Yes, they have added a few new test cases. But all scenarios are not covered.",1212393,1,8062
"The team has added one test to check if email is sent or not. However, the coverage as I can see on Github log is not increased.",1213701,1,8062
The team added a test case. However coveralls shows the following.   Overall coverage decreased (-17.2%) to 19.566%  I interpreted this as as decrease in coverage. ,1213539,1,8062
Yes.,1211651,-1,8062
Yes everything is working as intended,1213138,-1,8062
The project is to refactor the existing functionality and code. The functionality seems to be working fine. ,1212176,1,8062
"Yes, this does work properly",1213426,-1,8062
The system operation works well as intended.,1214069,-1,8062
"Yes, it looks fine to me.",1212394,-1,8062
Could not find steps to replicate on UI. Documentation does not mention steps how to test the feature. More information required as I was not able to follow the steps ,1213702,1,8062
The functionality works fine. Good job team! No suggestions.,1213540,-1,8062
"The write up is well documented and covers all the needed information covering problem statement , a detailed explanation of how the functionality is implemented with what changes have been made to the different files and test case that they have added.",1213139,-1,8062
They should have added the code as a part of the writeup instead of providing links to github commits.,1212842,1,8062
"The write-up is clear , concise and explains the work done properly. Some screen shots would have been handy though",1212177,-1,8062
"Write up is really good. but little short. Could have been described with more details. Also, it would have been better if they ha uploaded the screencast of the work they had done.",1213427,1,8062
The writeup was written very nicely in the first round itself. ,1214070,-1,8062
Very detailed. Great job.,1212395,-1,8062
Writeup is descriptive. But missing the following: 1. Screenshots of implementation 2. Steps to replicate the problem  3. Instructions not provided. 4. Too many sub topics for solution implemented,1213703,1,8062
The writeup is written in a very verbose manner. They still haven't added the test plan which was missing.  Suggestion: I feel that the test plan should have been added explicitly. ,1213541,1,8062
"Yes , I think that the code can be deployed",1213140,-1,8062
"Needs some work, code climate changes, a bit of DRYness and a passing CI is needed.",1212843,1,8062
"The team has added the test case for issue#1190 which are Rspec tests. The test plan includes how to test issues #391 and #1201 by logging in as an instructor, but test cases do not seem to be present for this part.",1213991,1,8072
"I think User experience and code readability are as imp as producing a working code. So based on how urgent is the requirement for this functionality, I would prioritize refactoring the Notices and Display messages to more appropriately indicate what action was taken when we try to add a participant to the assignment or import using a CSV file. Secondly improving the comments as explained with an example in the first question.",1212178,1,8062
"Yes, it works perfectly ",1213428,-1,8062
The overall test coverage decreased by 0.6%. You could have added test cases to  response controller.rb and application helper.rb. These files have contributed the most to the decrement in test coverage.                                ,1212686,1,8072
"Build issues to be fixed. This pull request is not in ""ready to merge"" state.",1212396,1,8062
"Not sure, since could not replicate. ",1213704,1,8062
"Yes, a fairly good job in that regard. They have first explained their test plans, then even provided links to their RSPEC tests which I checked. Then they have run and shown their screenshots of the Rspec tests going through successfully. Even, so their coverage seems to be an issue since it hasn't been updates since the last submission that was 19 days ago as per their pull request which even shows a decrease in their coverage.  ",1213046,1,8072
I'm unable to get a really good idea of exactly what was done here for this project other than that it can be used as a display and rendering port and that it improves fail-safeness of browsers.,1212212,1,8171
"The build is failing, but it seems the team has it working locally. I think they can get it working with this approach.",1214043,1,8171
They have added a test for the feature implemented. But coverage has decreased by a little.,1211810,1,8072
"The Pull request shows that the code has failed all the checks. Therefore it should not be deployed.  Suggestions: Rectify the code climate, Travis Build and the merge conflict that is being displayed on the Pull request(Gemfile.lock conflict) . Once done, the code could be deployed. Functionality is working fine, no doubt but build must not be deployed unless the above issues are resoled. ",1213542,1,8062
The team has added one spec to check whether a different directory path is generated after generation of a duplicate assignment. The overall coverage decreases by 0.6% The written test covers one of the three issues given to the team. There is scope to add some more tests,1212014,1,8072
"The test plan is added and Rspec test has been added.Overall testing seems good,",1211761,-1,8072
The build hasn't passed in the travis CI,1213136,1,8062
"Because of the merge conflict in gemlock file, it is not merged and travis CI has not run.  i believe they ran bundle update and committed the file which should not happen as it updates the dependencies and might break some features.",1212839,1,8062
Travis CI tests have failed. But there are no conflicts and the build is ready to be merged with Master branch.,1212174,1,8062
No there were no conflicts and do not need to be resolved.,1213424,-1,8062
Travis CI build is failing.,1212392,1,8062
"No, Travis test did not pass. In fact, I can see test failures for each commit. Continuous integration tests has failed.",1213700,1,8062
The Travis CI build does not pass.  Suggestion: Team should have rectified this. ,1213538,1,8062
"Pull request failed the tests, so that must be fixed before merging.",1212808,1,8171
"They did add one test case, but I think it is not enough.",1212386,1,8072
"The team has added a new test to cover the functionality. But this test is failing. There could be an issue with the notice that is generated, as during run time it is set to nil and this is checked against the string provided in the test. The overall test coverage has decreased by 0.6%.",1214131,1,8072
"I couldn't test manually, but the videos show proper operation.",1213208,-1,8072
"As per their screencast(shared on the gdrive link), the feature seems to be working locally. There is no Heroku deployment or a link to the VCL present.",1213992,-1,8072
"As suggested by the Mozilla team themselves, a few errors need to be rectified. The final code also needs to be formatted using rustfmt to make it consistent with the design",1212361,1,8171
Did not even pass the auto test.,1214281,1,8171
"There can be a few changes incorporated to the code- especially the name mismatch of the web IDL and corresponding Rust file needs to be fixed. The unnecessary comments have to be removed. Moreover, the pull request shows that there are a few changes that have been requested and all checks have failed. So, the code can be merged and deployed only after these are incorporated. ",1212185,1,8171
I think that they need to fix some things that are mentioned by travis CI. Once they do that they are good to go.,1213217,1,8171
The code is almost completed. Only a few final touches will make it ready to be deployed onto the production server. Maybe the future team can also work on it to achieve some more enhanced features.,1212115,-1,8171
"I don't think this project is the type that would be deployed on a production server, and I can't say it's ready to be added because every thing in the pull failed on github.",1212213,1,8171
Still did not pass the Travis CI,1214277,1,8171
This is not an Expertiza project.,1212111,-1,8171
Everything in the pull request failed (although this is not an expertiza project),1212209,1,8171
The system works well and performs all the operations correctly. -1 for the aforementioned errors in code.,1212687,1,8072
"Yes, the code has been refactored to cover all the intended scenarios and the tests have been very well documented along with testing the edge cases as said from their videos. Their Rspec however doesn't seem to test many test cases but that's expected I guess given their problem statement. ",1213047,1,8072
Everything works as per the video linked in google drive. A link to the same can be added on the wiki page.  ,1211811,1,8072
The UI and system operation works as intended. The video provided clearly shows the issues that the team has handled.,1212015,-1,8072
"According to their video, their code works well. ",1212387,-1,8072
"One of the videos linked in the wiki has a broken link. The other link shows the functionality is working correctly.  Even though the wiki has given instructions to test the functionality, the team has not deployed there code. This has blocked manual testing.",1214132,1,8072
"The writeup is great. I could get all the info i needed to understand the problem. Could refine the describing issues section a bit as I could see sentences like "" Please take a look at the Github issue for suggestions on how to solve this.""",1213209,1,8072
"The team did not have a writeup in the last submission. In this submission, they do have a writeup with the problem statement, the files modified, approach to solving the problems, and test plan. This seems to be a significant improvement from the last submission. As for the screencast links, I think one link is absent and the other one is a YouTube video of the same project submitted last year. Please check this, I think you have added the wrong link. I would also suggest that a references section needs to be added to the Wiki page so that the deployment, pull request and other project reference links are shown.",1213993,1,8072
The write up has seen significant improvement. Flow diagram has been made and screen casts have been added to show the flow. Screen casts have been added for both bugs and functionality. Very good job,1212688,-1,8072
"Extremely well written Wiki Page, thorough and to the point with enough technical content and relevant screenshots pertaining to the before and after scenarios of the problem statements. Moreover, its a considerable improvement from the last submission where in they had nothing of the sort. ",1213048,-1,8072
"It is very well written with a nice flow diagram. The second video link on the wiki page is unavailable, which can be fixed/removed in case it is legacy.",1211812,1,8072
The write-up is comprehensive and clearly mentions the filenames where the changes have been made. Moreover the team has explained the logic behind the code in the video provided which is really helpful. The team has done a good job with respect to that. They have added an flowchart image explaining the logic behind checkbox. This adds up to the readability of the project,1212016,-1,8072
"The writeup is detailed and the authors have done a nice job. It covers issue, their solution, explanation of the solution and test plan.",1211763,-1,8072
The team had not added a link to the wiki during Round 1 of the review.  'Issues to be fixed' section seems incomplete and not the right kind of writing. Please review and try to add more details on the issues that are being addressed. Otherwise the wiki looks good with relevant diagrams and code snippets.,1214133,1,8072
"Yes, there are only minor modifications and they are well justified.",1213210,-1,8072
"The code can be deployed once the Travis CI passes and there are some 6 minor warnings to be fixed in code climate. There are 4 failing and 1 successful checks, the team needs to make sure these checks pass in order to be able deploy the code onto the production server.",1213994,1,8072
This code is ready to be deployed if they ensure that variables are renamed to resemble their actual functionality.  No big issues as such. Resolves the problems well.,1212689,1,8072
Once the issues with pull request are fixed it can be merged.,1211813,1,8072
"Unsure in this regard since they neither have the deployment neither the GitHub link to their repository, and also the coverage and the Travis CI say otherwise. Even so, in their video they show in proof that everything runs. One does wonder though, how to test without actually having the links of the repo. ",1213049,1,8072
"Some improvements are required before deploying it to the main server. There are changes suggested by codeclimate which need to be looked upon. The future team must ensure to pass the build. There is scope for the new tests to be written and code that would improve the overall coverage. Overall, the team has done a commendable effort with respect to the difference in the first and second submission",1212017,1,8072
"I believe that code, as it stands, is not ready to be deployed. More comments are needed and the code is hard to understand, so even though the changes are small, one might need to see id the changes can be simplified. I believe testing can be more thorough too. ",1211764,1,8072
"If they can write more test cases to test their code and make sure their code does not have bugs, i think they can deploy their code onto server. ",1212389,1,8072
"No. The code needs to be cleaned up before it can be deployed. The build failure needs to be fixed. Also, as the project is not deployed, manual testing could not be done.",1214134,1,8072
"On checking the pull request, it shows the Travis CI check has failed.",1213206,1,8072
The build does not pass in Travis CI check.   They build job for TESTFOLDER = controllers is failing currently. I would suggest them to investigate the cause of this.  ,1213990,1,8072
The Travis CI build has failed however there are no merge conflicts. You could have fixed the Travis CI build errors in phase 2.  Still overall good job.,1212685,1,8072
"No, according to Travis CI the build doesn't seem to have passed due to some bundle install errors. Although they surely should have resolved it because the code wouldn't be able to achieve the above results as stated by their video and wikipedia page. ",1213045,1,8072
Few of the travis tests have failed. The issues were code guidelines and spacing issues.,1211809,1,8072
The build test failed in Travis CI. However there were no conflicts with the base branch.,1212013,1,8072
The build fails and there are several issues and warnings that need to be fixed. ,1211760,1,8072
"Even though the build is failing in Travis CI, there are no conflicts. The controller tests are failing as there is no flash message that is appearing. Please look into this.",1214130,1,8072
The code seemed to be well written in the first round. But I dont see changes done in round 2. The github link provided shows last commit for Oct 21. Though I see that there are change made in the wiki which were required and are done well.,1213169,-1,8089
The code was well written even in the first round.,1213246,-1,8058
"I don not think their code is good, because they did not solve the problems existing in the first round.",1214198,-1,8058
The present test cases appear to be written fine.,1211557,-1,8058
"No, the authors didn't improve the code.",1212053,-1,8058
Variable names and test cases are named appropriately. Explanation of reasons for the style of code and problem solving approach is lacking.,1214499,1,8058
Seems at par with the coding standards,1212450,-1,8089
"In the first round, which files were related to what issue was not mentioned. However, now they have edited the wiki to reflect the mentioned changes. Each file and its related functionality has been mentioned. Appreciated!",1212299,1,8089
There is no change in the code in this round. The variable names and method names are intuitive. The code is well indented; some useful comments can be included to improve readability. The code is DRY.,1212900,1,8089
"Did not find problems in the code in the first round. Follows ruby style guide, commented and good naming. Very well written.",1213339,-1,8089
"The team has implemented proper functions and has used a proper naming convention. However, there is scope to add some comments. For ex: in the new method - get_feedback_assessments_for method which will return a feedback assessment, the team could have added some comments about the logic implemented. Apart from this, the code is concise and good coding and Ruby practices have been followed",1212004,1,8089
The code is well-written with proper comments. But none of the suggestions from the previous review has been implemented. Teams are provided reviews so that they can further improve upon the code.,1214240,1,8089
 It's fine to good. I wish y'all would have posted a link to your repo in stead of the pull request.,1213917,1,8058
No new commits have been made in the 2nd round,1213247,-1,8058
the latest commit is on 2nd of Nov.,1211942,-1,8058

I cannot find any new test cases.,1211944,-1,8058
"The last commit was 21 days ago, so I fear that that there are no commits being made in round 2. Could have done a commit in round two just to confirm that there were no changes required in round 2, so that the reviewer may be certain about it.",1213170,1,8089
Last commit seems to be 11 days ago,1212452,-1,8089
No new commits have been made. All changes are in the documentation only.,1212300,-1,8089

"Coverage went up by 8.4%, according to coveralls.",1211560,-1,8058
"Yes, the team has added test cases, the code for a couple of test cases are in the wiki in a separate section. Again, it would have been better to explain the test cases a little more, may be using screenshots of successful test cases.",1213172,1,8089
No new test were added but earlier tests are working.,1212456,-1,8089
 No the team did not add any new test cases. Coverage is low.,1214502,-1,8058
 They added all the test cases! There is so much coverage now!,1213920,-1,8058
The team has added test cases but the code coverage has decreased by 0.04%. The newly added tests cover almost all the new functionality implemented. The new test cases are pretty diverse.,1212302,1,8089
Overall coverage was increased by 8+ percentage. ,1212868,-1,8058
"The tests cover all the scenarios. Given that the problem statement is pretty open-ended, the changes fulfil the purpose.",1213250,-1,8058
"Yes, It works .",1214202,-1,8058
"The code was well written, DRY was not violated.",1213197,-1,8022
The code was well written. Although there were some problems with codeclimate identations. The team have made changes to fix those issues.,1214100,1,8022
"The code seems to be dry, and I had no issues with it in the 1st round.",1213938,-1,8022
It looks as good as round 1. ,1213931,-1,8022
"Naming looks good, they had already added comment to the code in the first review.",1212060,-1,8022
Don't see any DRY issues. Well Written Test code,1213557,-1,8022
The code is well written.  No suggestions.,1213758,-1,8022
The team has added test cases: 1. To check that if there is no rejoinder for the review then it redirects to new author feedback page. 2. To check that the other teammate is able to edit. 3. To check if the page is redirecting back to review. 4. To check if the rejoinder by a participant of a team is saved properly.  The overall coverage decreased from 48% to 47.601%. It decreased by 0.04%,1212903,-1,8089
"Only 34% of the lines of code in review_response_map.rb were covered, according to their video. This is much lower than the 90% required by the project descriptions.",1211561,1,8058
The team have added the test cases which covers the range of the project. Coverage increased.,1213342,1,8089
"The code is structured well and is straightforward to follow. Test blocks are succinct and contain one assertion per block. The project has been greatly improved since the 1st round. Naming and indentation issues have been fixed. Furthermore, significant work has been done for the code to be consistent with Code Climate. One suggestion would be to elaborate on the #score method. Decomposition could be used to extract the common set up into a separate before(:each) block and test expectations using multiple 'it' statements as opposed to having everything asserted in one 'it' block.",1212137,1,8022
Not cover all the scenarios.,1212057,1,8058
The coverage has decreased by 0.04%. The team has added some tests which were not present in the initial submission. 44.9% of the changed lines are covered,1212007,1,8089
No there had been no bad names or wrong conventions used even in round 1. so no change there. The team has made few modifications to beautify the code by using ternary conditions which did make the code elegant. No new comments added.,1211494,-1,8022
" No, changes made from last review.",1214503,-1,8058
"The team has written new test cases, but the overall test case coverage has decreased by 0.04%. The tests cover the range of this project.",1214243,1,8089
Commits for Code Climate changes were pushed in.,1213198,-1,8022
"I think it covers all of the scenarios, but don't quote me. I don't have a great understanding of review response map.",1213921,-1,8058
"The team added new commits in the second round as well to improve their code style, improve codeclimate issues and changes other reviewer's suggested. Very few teams have done this. Great work.",1214101,-1,8022
Several commits were made to decrease the code climate warnings.,1213939,-1,8022
Yes. They are updating code to fix code climate issues. ,1213932,-1,8022
"Yes, there are new codes committed during the 2nd round.",1212282,-1,8022
Yes commits are done to fix the code climate issues.,1212363,1,8022
"An unnecessary commit has been performed because  of which build has failed, and i think it wasn't required as already code had 100% coverage. You should check that out, it just an indentation issue i think. Format it using rubymine and push, it should work.  A shorter video to explain the work has been added as well. ",1212061,1,8022
I found many commits related to the code climate fixes.  No suggestions.,1213759,1,8022
"The number of commits since the 1st round is impressive.  Significant improvements have been done pertaining to naming, indentation and overall Code Climate issues.",1212138,-1,8022
"No new commits with respect to code or functionality. Just few indentations,  comment changes and code beautifications done",1211495,-1,8022
"The system operation from UI works as expected by the project. I was able to verify that the rejoinder is given by the team instead of team member. The rejoinder is also made easily available to the user, by providing easy navigation options to give feedback to reviewers, hence making the UI more user friendly. The Author feedback section contains the team's collective feedback to reviewers of particular assignments. Most of the task is to refactor code so that it complies with the new requirement of team rejoinders, and the features work as expected.",1212904,-1,8089
Works as intended. Could have elaborated a little more like a guidance in wiki.  Was able to test the features. Works fine.,1213343,1,8089
The projects works as intended. Some of the issues in the problem statement covers refactoring which has been properly handled by the team.,1212008,-1,8089
The team has not provided steps for manual testing even though this was requested during round 1 review.,1214244,1,8089
Test cases were added. Overall increase in the coverage range observed.,1213200,-1,8022
"Yes, the team added relevant test cases which increased the overall coverage.",1214103,-1,8022
"The authors have added the screenshots from github which clearly shows the code change. But since there are many changes, the explanation in the wiki is small. A better way would have been to put the links to the git files where the changes are made and there could be more explanations instead. This would also reduce the size of the wiki.",1213174,1,8089
"No unit tests were added during the resubmission, but they had an initially high coverage.",1213941,-1,8022
They should have included screenshots associated with the issue. it would help one understand the solution better,1212460,1,8089
"They achieve 100% during first round, so I don't think there are any new test need to be added. ",1213934,-1,8022
"Yes, they coverage is 100%.",1212284,-1,8022
Dissatisfied with the write up because no clear explanation has been given for how they arrived at the design. At some places the documentation abruptly stops mid-explanation. The code screenshots and the accompanying explanation is good.,1212304,1,8089
Yes the project was about testing and coverage has increased.,1212365,-1,8022
Nicely written wiki. ,1211464,-1,8089
"Although the write up clearly explains the problem statement and also contains the changes made, it doesn't include the test plan which would give a clearer picture of the changes added.",1213251,1,8058
The coverall showed that the Overall coverage increased (+3.2%) to 39.999% The coverage of the participant.rb file is 100%. So great job team! No suggestions.,1213761,-1,8022
"basically, it is good. however, i cannot find the test paln, and some explanation is not complete.",1211946,1,8058
"The write up is simple and understandable. It starts off by describing about Expertiza, motivation behind the project, the tasks to do, list of classes that are modified and impacted by the change. I like how the authors have screenshots of both the existing code that is removed and the new code that is added in the pull request, which juxtaposes them and highlights the tasks in the problem statement and goals of the project. The write up then ends with the test plan which lists the test cases handled.",1212905,-1,8089
The code coverage was 100% in the 1st round.,1212140,-1,8022
YEs the project was a test project and the team has managed to achieve 100% coverage of the model. There was no increase in coverage from Round 1 to Round 2,1211497,-1,8022
"No, it is not good at all, they didn't explain the functionality of their test code.",1214203,1,8058
Could have been more elaborate how to check the work. No mention of design principles or patterns used. ,1213344,1,8089
The project works as intended. Test cases are showing a positive impact on the results.,1213201,-1,8022
The writeup was still on wikipedia and didn't expand on the reasons why the test cases were the way they are. No justification was provided for why only 34% of the LoC in the model was covered.,1211562,1,8058
"Yes, the tests cover all the scenarios one should check for. Great work !!!",1214104,-1,8022
Everything is good here!,1213942,-1,8022
"The write-up lacks screenshots/ relevant images/ screencast to explain the workflow of the project. This would increase the readability of the wikipage. Also, the team has added testplan and included description for the code presented in the wiki. These points were mentioned during the previous review which were picked up by the team. The team has done a good work in improving their writeup as compared to the previous version.",1212009,1,8089
"There has been some improvement in the content of the write-up, but not all suggestions have been incorporated. Adding more screenshots of the functionality, or a video of the project being explained will always be helpful.",1214245,1,8089
"Edge cases are tested, and all scenarios for each method are tested. ",1213935,-1,8022
" The authors have included the different tests that they wrote, however a description of what the test is testing would be helpful.",1214504,1,8058
"Yes, they coverage is 100%.",1212285,-1,8022
Yes a lot of cases concerning a participant has been added.,1212366,-1,8022
"yes, 100% coverage has been achieved as shown in the video.",1212064,-1,8022
"Y'all did the least possible work, AND put it on wikipedia instead of the expertiza wiki.",1213922,-1,8058

The tests specified in the participant.rb file run perfectly well . The same has been demonstrated in the video mentioned above. No suggestions.,1213762,-1,8022
The code coverage is 100%. Every test case passes after a manual check.,1212141,-1,8022
"Yes, the test does covers 99% of the models variations. The team could have enhanced tests with varied inputs, such as for the handle method check. Even a more through test of the score method with different input data could have been done. ",1211498,1,8022
The writeup was significantly well written. Almost all the changes were covered.,1213202,-1,8022
The team has written their wiki page in a very detailed manner. They even added the video links which were missing in the first round as suggested. Thank you and good job :),1214105,-1,8022
Easily one of the most clearly documented projects I have reviewed in this class so far. I liked their organization of the Test Plan within the write-up.,1213943,-1,8022
"The wiki page provides clear details about the work, and very easy to understand. Just like round 1. ",1213936,-1,8022

"Well explained, all the test cases have been explained and are self explanatory as well.",1212065,-1,8022
Well Written,1213562,-1,8022
The writeup is really well written and has covered all the desired aspects along with the test plan. No suggestions.,1213763,-1,8022
The writeup clearly defines the primary objective of the project and justifies the reasoning behind introduction of additional helper constructs like participant factory. The authors complement the descriptions of each test case with associated block of code and elaborate on the details of their inner workings.,1212142,-1,8022
"The write-up and screen cast were both very explanatory. It included detailed code, the need for the test of partipant.rb and the use of the model. There was no change required from the initial write up.",1211499,-1,8022
The code is well organized and written & ready to be merged into the production server.,1213203,-1,8022
"Although I believe this project is ready to be merged into the branch, I would still like to make sure as to why their build is failing in Travis CI. Most likely it's not because of their own code, but as a suggestion the team should have also looked into this matter themselves, and explicitly stated somewhere in the wiki by getting clarification from the instructors.",1214106,1,8022
"The document straight away starts with the explanation of the project specifics without any background as to what was the whole purpose of doing this. Problem statement is very general, it could have been more specific as to what was the drawbacks of the existing implementation and how that can be resolved with the new changes. The doc also lacks a test plan.  It is preferable for the doc to be written in expertiza wiki rather than the normal wiki. ",1212870,1,8058

"Build is failing, they should solve that issue, then it is ready for production.",1212066,1,8022
2 of the methods are resulting in Errors,1213563,1,8022
"No, they code is not complete, and many cases are not covered.",1214204,1,8058
The code can definitely be deployed but once the 3 pending code climate issues(I believe the 3 are to be resolved by he mentor) and the Travis CI build have been rectified. Suggestion: Rectify the Travis CI issues.,1213764,1,8022
"The project is ready to be merged. The source code is clearly structured and can be used for the future team to work on. The project has 100% code coverage.  In order to avoid potential problems of using AssignmentParticipant instance, participantSuper object is defined in factories.rb, which is an instance of Participant class. The possible suggestions are to deconstruct #scores method and introduce 'context' constructs to enhance code documentation.",1212143,1,8022
"It's a test project, so not applicable for production deployment. But the code can be merged as appropriate test for participant model. Any future teams can enhance the test with varied input scenarios.",1211500,1,8022
"34% is better than nothing, but it's still a far-cry from a complete unit test suite for the review_response_map model. I'd recommend it be merged, but it needs to be completed.",1211563,1,8058
Conflicts were resolved to an extent for the Travis Cl. But not all the tests are passing.,1213199,1,8022
"Still 25 issues, checked by codeclimate, to fix",1212059,-1,8058
"Unfortunately, the build failed in the second round. But, in my opinion this was not due to the team's mistake. The build failure says the two examples failed are in files ""assignment_spec.rb"" and ""assignment_participant_spec.rb"", both files which the team had no connection with. I could be wrong though. As the build was passing and there tests were running in the first round, I am inclined to believe it was because of another team's incorrect code that this team pulled into their branch by mistake.",1214102,1,8022
"The pull request says the Travis CI build is in progress, but that seems improbable. Upon closer investigation into the Travis CI ""details"", it looks like the build is failing.",1213940,1,8022
"It is pending while I am doing this review. When I click on it, it did not pass Travis CI, but it fails on tests on features, while this group is testing participant, it happened to our group as well, I assume it is not an issue with their code.",1213933,1,8022
The Travis CI is in progress and there are 3 codeclimate issue to fix.  ,1212283,1,8022
"Some travis ci tests have failed and some code climate issues are still pending, though the commit comments say that the issues aren't related to the project files. But they have tried to fix the issues though so good work.",1212364,1,8022
"A commit has been performed 4 days back , which isn't making any change to the code just the indentation, and since then build hasn't passed. You should check that out, it just an indentation issue i think. Format it using rubymine and push, it should work.",1212062,1,8022
"TRAVIS CI didn't Pass, but team have fixed most of CODE Climate issues",1213559,1,8022
"The Travis CI build did not fail exactly but it did not pass either. It showed in progress. But when I clicked on the details, it showed that the test failed.  Suggestion: Travis CI issue should have been rectified.",1213760,1,8022
The previous builds of this project did not pass Travis CI. The current build status is pending.,1212139,1,8022
The pull request has failed but doesnt look like its related to the team's commit. there is already an existing issue present.,1211496,1,8022
" The build does not pass. Also, the coverage is very low. Not many testcases.",1214505,-1,8058
"yes, the authors have improved the code. the team has worked on the issue which I mentioned in the previous review. The code doesn't seems to be confusing now but it still needs proper commenting to be done. ",1213225,1,8079
The function process seems to be a bit long. It could have been splitted based on oscillator types rather than having all of them in the same function. Apart from that rest of the code seems great.,1212313,1,8079
The code seems to be fine but due to lack of comments a little hard to understand. It would have been better if there were some comments in get_due_date_data and addQuestionnaireTableRow.,1214086,1,8079
There are lots of code climate issues to be fixed.,1212662,1,8079
"They haven't made any change since round 1 review. Haven't changed the naming as well eg topic_id1 doesn't seem right to me. But other than 1 or 2 names, everything else looks clean. Also you haven't added comments to you code. YOu should add comments when working in a open source project.",1212088,1,8079
"It's probably fine if the integration tests can be resolved, and the code smells from code climate can be fixed.",1213923,1,8058
A few comments could be included in code to make it more clear.,1213127,1,8079
The biggest concern are the simple code climate issues.,1212871,-1,8058
"Suggested changes related to naming convention are not included in the 2nd round.  variable names : rop_topic_deadline1 , topic_id1 Puts statements are not removed : p topic_id1   Other than this the code is properly written following coding best practices.  ",1213468,1,8079
The build is passing successfully,1213248,-1,8058

Passed Travis but had many lingering CodeClimate failures.,1211559,1,8058
" The project does not pass the Travis CI integration tests. I looked at its output, and I cannot tell how significant the failure is. Maybe its an easy fix?",1213919,1,8058
there is only one commit made during the entire project. there is no new code added during the 2nd round.,1213226,1,8079
There has been only one commit for the entire project.,1212775,1,8079
"The reason to give 3 is that there are certain simple code climate issues regarding spaces, indentation and so. These are easy to fix and are related to code quality.",1212867,1,8058
Commits were made in second round ,1212314,-1,8079
No. There was a single commit throughout the project period and that was during the 1st round.,1214087,1,8079
No commits were done in round 2.,1212663,1,8079
Nothing changed since round 1. Haven't added a shorter video or a video with sound. Haven't made naming changes.,1212089,1,8079
"No, the code was last committed on Oct 31st.",1213128,1,8079
There were no new commits in the 2nd round.,1213469,1,8079
I don't see any code changes after the first round.,1212509,1,8079
"No, there are no test cases added by the team.",1213228,1,8079
"No, the team did not add any test cases and the coverage did not increase. The overall decrease was -13.6% to 34.007%",1214089,1,8079
No new tests were added and coverage has also reduced. Some UI testing could've been done.,1212665,1,8079
They have mentioned that its UI change and has been discussed that testing isn't required in there documentation. But i think you should still have mentioned something there. Steps to follow to check how your changes work. ,1212091,1,8079
The link to the deployed application was not available. So testing could not be performed.,1213131,1,8079
the authors has worked on write-up.they have worked on the issue which I mentioned in the previous review. The code doesn't seems to be confusing now. the content on the page is in proper format earlier which was not. Test plan still need the team's attention. ,1213230,1,8079
"The write was good and well-written. However, it would have been better if some screenshots were also present in the writeup. May be juxtaposing the screenshots of 'before and after' of fixing the issues. That would have made the write-up easier to understand.",1214091,-1,8079
Write up isn't good. They have just added there code in the write up without explaining anything. Plus no comments in code. Code snippets in writeup are going off the page.,1212093,1,8079
"The writeup is good and clearly explains the issues faced. However instead of putting in the code changed, I feel it would be better to have screenshots of git commit history where we can see both the previous code and new code to get a good idea of what actually was changed.",1213132,1,8079
The write-up is well written and organised. Everything looks fine. The team should have mentioned about the approach taken to solve the mentioned problem statement which will make the implementation easier to understand. Also the team could have included few screen shots in the write-up.  ,1213473,1,8079
* Test plan is missing. * Code is directly copy-pasted in the approach section - pseudo code with proper comments would have been better. * Wiki alignment is missing in those places where the code is copy-pasted.  ,1212513,1,8079
"some improvements are required to deployed the code onto the production server. The code should included proper commenting so that if the future team picks up from this project, they could know what exactly the code is doing.",1213231,1,8079
It might be good to move the long function to smaller functions. But the code looks clean and understandable.,1212319,1,8079
The feature seems ok but it can't be deployed yet with all pending issues.,1212668,1,8079
"Writeup needs to be improved, video needs to have sound or make shorter videos. Build is failing, code climate has 56 issues. So no its not ready for deployment onto production. The way they have implemented is fine but they need to work on the said issue to make it production ready.",1212094,1,8079
Since the code coverage has decreased and the video demonstrates a proper working,1211458,1,8079
ll the checks are failing currently. The changes have a lot of robocop issues as well which should be fixed. Also the CI build is failing at the moment. Some of the tests are failing because of the change. ,1213474,1,8079
"Code looks fine, but build issue has to be fixed.",1212514,1,8079
"the build is still failing and there are issues which needs the team's attention. there is one warning and 1 error which needs to be fixed by the issue. according to the error, team should remove the debug code from the pull request.",1213227,1,8079
"Travis CI build is not passed. Though this was a bit common even for the second review, the 'codeclimate' issues are still showing.",1212776,1,8079
"No, the build did not pass in Travis CI. Several checks had failed but there was no conflict.",1214088,1,8079
"None of the tests - travis ci, code climate have passed",1212664,1,8079
Everything is failing. Code climate has 56 issues. Build is failing. Haven't made a change since round 1.,1212090,1,8079
The Travis test has failed and overall coverage has also decreased. There were many errors in the build log of travis.,1213129,1,8079
All the checks including the CI build is failing.,1213470,1,8079
Build is failing in Travis CI,1212510,1,8079
"Code looks concise. However at few places, indentation is messed up.",1213155,1,8025
The code has been written as per the coding standard. The code written by the team adheres to dry principle.,1211536,-1,8025
"the code was well written, following the principles.",1213387,-1,8025
I'm essentially keeping my feedback the same. There are places where I believe that better names could be used and smaller javascript methods could be used. ,1212816,1,8025
max_choosers name was not changed. As far as i understand it denotes the maximum number of slots and should be called max_slots. which is not changed. Apart from this code is good.,1212718,1,8025
"Yes, code is well written",1213719,-1,8025
"The code is well written and follows all the DRY problems.  The team has changed the files based on previous reviews and to make it more DRY comments before the methods that they created gave a better understanding what each code does. // function for showing warning when number of slots is set as zero   Changing the names that suited the functionality more, is appreciated. addCreateTopicSection() appendCreateTopicSection()  ",1213012,-1,8025
There does not seem any issues with the code. The team has properly used the naming convention and has provided comments wherever necessary,1211990,-1,8025
"The code was well written during the last review too, it only missed comments. A few comments have been added but still a major portion of code remains uncommented.  Other than that, the code is nicely written, follows guidelines and variable names are appropriate.",1211723,1,8025
Few new commits are made,1213156,-1,8025
There has been 2 commits made in second round. One for adding comments and another one for fixing Issue #926 the sorting of topics by topic number in assignments.,1211537,-1,8025
3 New commits,1212719,-1,8025
Properly done in round 2 also,1213720,-1,8025
"The team has done few commits. One was on few sort fixes, while they other was on refactoring.",1213013,-1,8025
"The team has added some new commits which are about the added comments. The team has picked up the suggestion from the previous review to add comments for better readability, which is commendable.",1211991,-1,8025
A commit was done in second round addressing issues from reviews.,1211724,-1,8025
The coverage is actually decreased.,1213158,1,8025
The team has done good manual testing but it would help to add few test in features to test the impact of the changes done in functionality of the project.,1211539,1,8025
"The overall coverage decreased, but not significantly. It reduced by 0.01%/",1213390,1,8025
No new tests were written for this functionality. ,1212819,1,8025
No New Tests,1212721,1,8025
"Yes, team has added the test case",1213722,1,8025
No new test cases were added. The new code changes don't change the modify the existing code coverage. The modifications were mostly on UI. They could have added capybara testing.,1213015,1,8025
"Unfortunately, I could not see any code written by the team for testing. However, the team has provided a description on how some of the edge cases have been handled. According to coveralls, the overall test has decreased by 0.01%. This could be one of the major topics for improvements with regards to this issue",1211993,1,8025
"Tests have been thoroughly and very well performed. Also, well documented. ",1211726,-1,8025
No deployment provided so can't be verified.,1213159,1,8025
Yes the features work as described in the problem statement. The team has done good job and has fixed all the below issues:  Issue #971 Change create topic UI into AJAX.   Issue #926 We need a way to sort topics by topic number in assignment#edit page.   Issue #718 We should allow instructors to give feedback when accepting or rejecting topic suggestions. ,1211540,-1,8025
The code works as required.,1213391,-1,8025
The new features work as expected.,1212820,-1,8025
"The operation works perfectly from UI as shown in the youtube screencast. The App was not deployed anywhere (or the link was not posted), so couldnt test it by myself. Application could have been deployed during the second review for better understanding and trying out how the feature works.",1213016,1,8025
"The working is perfect, everything works as intended. The team has explained this in a brief manner in their youtube video.",1211994,-1,8025
System works as expected and this is evidenced by tests and videos.,1211727,-1,8025
The write-up is informative and provides all necessary details of the changes made.,1213160,-1,8025
The write up is impressive and very detailed. It has been documented well which helps to understand about the project and the code implementation. It also provides detailed test plan which makes it easier for end user to do UI testing.,1211541,-1,8025
The writeup is well organized and well documented.,1213392,-1,8025
"The write-up is well written. It looks like they have improved the test plan sections, but still no automated tests in the repository.",1212821,1,8025
"Write up is good and self explanatory. Test plan helped a lot in understanding how to test it. As discussed in the earlier review, images could have been resized for better visibility. Was little difficult when one had to scroll along the page to view the entire image.",1213017,1,8025
"The writeup is well written with proper screenshots. I liked that the team has provided appropriate screenshots for specific scenarios which covers all the aspects of the project. However, the Test-plan section could be improved by adding the test code",1211995,1,8025
Writeup is very detailed and well written. It is supplemented by enough code pieces and reasoning and good amount of pictures and videos to explain what the team has done in detail.,1211728,-1,8025
" I think with proper testing, this code is ready to be deployed onto the production server.",1213161,1,8025
The code has passed the travis test and has addressed  all the issues of the Change Request. The code should be production ready after adding few more edge test case scenarios.  ,1211542,1,8025
"Yes, the code can be deployed to production.",1213393,-1,8025
"Overall, I think it could be deployed. There are no tests however written for this functionality, and there are some UI patterns that should be re-considered before deploying that do not match each other. When saving feedback, the ability to save feedback is automatically present and there is a button per row, while in the other location, you must first make a row ""editable"".",1212822,1,8025
"Apart from some code-climate change, the code seems to be ready to merged",1212724,1,8025
"The code seems to be working good from the screencast. My biggest concern was, if the link to deployment was given, it would have been easier to try the features. Other than that, capybara test cases could have made it strong to go to the production server. If they feature did work the way as it was shown in the screencast, it can be deployed to production.",1213018,1,8025
"The team has checked most of the points given in the problem statement. However proper testing should be done before deploying this project on the main server. It must be ensured that the overall coverage increases. Other than the testing part, everything else has been implemented as expected.",1211996,1,8025
"The code is well written, tested and documented and hence I think it should be ready to be deployed. ",1211729,-1,8025
Yes the Travis CI build is passing successfully.  ,1213157,-1,8025
The build has passed. The are only 2 syntactical issues due to version difference.,1211538,1,8025
The Travis Build has passed. The only conflicts remaining to resolve are the Code Climate conflicts.,1213389,1,8025
Everything but the CodeClimate checks passed,1212818,1,8025
No conflicts and Build Passes,1212720,-1,8025
Yes no conflicts at all which needs to be resolved,1213721,-1,8025
"Yes, the Travis CI has passed.",1213014,-1,8025
The build has passed in Travis CI and no conflicts have occured.,1211992,-1,8025
The build passes and there are only minor warnings and issues which can safely be ignored.,1211725,1,8025
The code follows Ruby style guide.,1214268,-1,8080
The code is very well written and follows good coding practice,1213447,-1,8080
Project was on implementing test cases. The test cases are well written and the code coverage has increased.,1212320,-1,8080
"The code is both succinct and very carefully. i have not done the code check in the first round. but for this time, there's no bad names, functions are standardly-named, good alignment and commenting.",1214577,-1,8080
In documentation it mentions participant.rb model file is changed to for increasing code coverage. However the file is missing in the pull request generated. There is no mention about changes in the assignment_participant.rb file. But that is present in the pull request. It may be a name mismatch or some files are indeed missing. I pointed it out during the first review but changes are not incorporated currently. The code overall looks good. Proper variable names are used. Commenting is required,1212306,1,8080
"Code makes good use of rspec's describe and context options, and manages to achieve ~95% code coverage.",1211779,-1,8080
"Well, the code looks good and very much follows the Ruby Style Guide. The code also is DRY. It looks well written and does not any changes.",1211550,-1,8080
"The code consists of small methods that mostly test one thing. This results in high readability. The team has made an extensive use of 'context' constructs which further enhance the code documentation. Moreover, the team has improved the .sort_by_name method making it cleaner and easier to follow. This was complemented by the fix of bad names that were present in the first round (e.g. stu1, p1 etc.). One suggestion pertaining to the '#scores' block would be to use specific assertions of fields instead of testing the object via inspect method and comparing it to the string value.",1211466,1,8080
"I do not see any new commit after 5th November. In my opinion, some of the tests could be made more articulate in round 2.",1214269,1,8080
No new code was committed in the second round,1213448,1,8080
Code was not committed in second round.,1212321,1,8080
"According to the github page, it doesn't seems that new code are commited",1214578,1,8080
Yes code was committed to follow clean code practices based on first review.,1212307,-1,8080
Code was cleaned up 5 days ago.,1211780,-1,8080
"Yes, new code was committed in the 2nd round.",1211551,-1,8080
"The team has made two commits since the first review. The issues that were covered were '#scores' block and mock instance handling. However, the primary problem that the spec is testing an instance of AssignmentParticipant class instead of Participant was not addressed.",1211467,1,8080
"Test coverage remains the same at 94%. Hence, my suggestion/opinion is same as the previous review.",1214271,-1,8080
Yes they have added test case and it has increased the coverage by 3% and has increased the coverage to 39.721%,1213450,-1,8080
Project was writing unit test cases and the newly written test cases has increased the test cases.,1212323,-1,8080
"According to the github page, no new test cases",1214580,1,8080
Test coverage for assignment_participant model increased to 94 percent.,1212309,-1,8080
Coverage increased by 3%.,1211782,-1,8080
"Yes, the team has added test cases and the team has covered every functionality.",1211553,-1,8080
"The coverage has increased from ~77% to ~94% which is impressive. However, the previous issue was that #scores method of Participant was not called because the object that is being tested in this project is an instance of AssignmentParticipant class. This problem was handled by commenting out the #scores method of AssignmentParticipant so that Participant #scores method will be called instead. This breaks other parts of the code which depend on AssignmentParticipant's #scores implementation. The solution to this problem is to either define a new Participant class instance in the factory or to define it in the test code itself.",1211469,1,8080
I'm afraid no test cases were added in round 2.,1211588,-1,8080
"Except one method, all the other methods have been covered. This is similar to round 1 review given by me.",1214272,0,8080
Yes the test case covers all the required test cases along with the edge cases .,1213451,-1,8080
Project was on writing test cases and the newly written test cases has increased the coverage.,1212324,-1,8080
"Since it's unit test, it seems there's hardly a way to veirify with UI",1214581,-1,8080
All the test cases pass. Majority of test scenarios described in document is covered and automated,1212310,-1,8080
Video demonstrates working and passing tests.,1211783,-1,8080
There was no working deployment presented.,1211554,1,8080
The code coverage is ~94% which passes the required threshold.,1211470,-1,8080
The writeup seems to be well written. It is concise and to the point.,1214273,-1,8080
The write up is very well documented as it explains the test plans and also what changes have been made along with the reference to the files which have been modified,1213452,-1,8080
Write up is good but the explanation of plan of work could have included some points like the approach taken.,1212325,1,8080
"The writeup is excellent. Very carefully written, a lot of detailed explanation. Some more background information about the functions can be more helpful, as well as syntax summation.",1214582,1,8080
"Explains the testing functionality appropriately. As mentioned in Review one, technicalities are explained thoroughly but the functional knowledge required to understand what the test is doing and why it is doing what it does is missing. Along with mentioning what are the mappings and return values, proper explanation of what the test is written for will be more appropriate in a document.",1212311,1,8080
"The writeup is detailed, but it doesn't explain why code in the model had to be commented out very well. That was a bit alarming.",1211784,1,8080
Very clearly writeup,1212072,-1,8080
"It is well written, quite understandable. It clearly and adequately indicates the working functionality. I can understand what the project is about.",1211555,-1,8080
The writeup is comprehensive and fully covers given functionality. There were no significant issues that needed to be fixed from the first round. ,1211471,-1,8080
The writeup is complete and well organized. And it also mentions the corresponding change in origin code.,1211590,-1,8080

Very good guidance. Works as intended. This project is about enhancing Juniper bookmarks. The features work as they are supposed to. Automated RSpec tests were added. Could have described the automated tests in the wiki.,1212974,1,8103
yes ,1214139,-1,8103
"Yes, as mentioned in the problem statement, the solution is delivered. It works fine. ",1212610,-1,8103

"The writeup is great, in first round they did not have a test plan part. But they added it in the second part.",1211988,-1,8103
"Since the Travis test has failed, merging the code would not be a good idea. The project doesn't need to be redone from scratch, some modifications to the existing work could make the project ready for deployment.",1213874,1,8103
"No, all the features have not been implemented e.g 1. A reviewer can be recognized or credited if he added useful bookmarks i.e if the author has made use of the bookmark. 2. A function to add badges automatically if a participant had submitted more than threshold number of useful bookmarks. plus build did not pass as well",1212354,1,8103
"Yes, the code seems good to deploy if we consider the manual testing and the video demonstration. But since it didn't pass Travis CI, this claims seems a bit of a concern. If we ignore the fact that lines of code was >500, and thats why Travis CI failed, but still there are a few lingering issues which the Travis CI pointed, which still hasn't been fixed. It seems more of a patch, which would require more patches to patch in the future.",1213867,1,8103
"This code will need to be refactored, however, we will not need to build it from scratch. Only some functionality has to be divided into chunks and moved into helper functions. The functionality works well.",1212248,1,8103

"No, its not as the coverage is increases by small amount.",1212927,-1,8103
No issues codewise. Can add test cases and after thorough testing It can be deployed. Yes other team can take up and fix the minor issues and build pass.,1212976,1,8103

"No. I do not think the code is ready to be deployed. I found the code change hard to understand, there are no comments and neither has the logic or rationale behind the new/changed code been given in the wiki. Besides, the build fails and there are a host of issues that need to be fixed.  Although all this might only be trivial issues and can be fixed rather easily, the code as of now, is not deployment-ready according to me. ",1211799,1,8103
"The code has been merged in a good way and there have been no merge conflicts. However, the Travis CI was failing and the code climate check was failing too.

If it works just like in the video then definitely yes.,1213528,-1,8024
"Yes, it is ready.",1211514,-1,8024
"Yes, the pull request did pass the Travis CI. It didn't has any conflicts with the base branch, but it did have some unresolved issues which needed to be fixed, namely: cognitive complexity was 6, and condition size for two files were too high.",1213926,1,8024
Travis-CI Passes,1212727,-1,8024
"Yes, the build request has been passed.",1211510,-1,8024
I could not find Travis CI,1213524,-1,8024
The build did not pass travis CI. I did a demo of their project and it seems to work given the credentials provided. THe encountered some minor indentation errors but otherwise the feature addition/fixing part seems good. The test cases written for the controller was very little though. The code coverage was just 14% approximately.,1213073,1,8024
The code has been written as per the coding standard. The code written by the team adheres to dry principle.,1214492,-1,8112
"The code is more about refactoring which is mentioned in the wiki, but I do not see any of the code in which changes are made. Could have mentioned them in the wiki for better clarity. ",1213461,1,8112
The code follows DRY principles,1214170,-1,8112
"Bad names like ""review_num"" have been used.",1212739,1,8112
"there was no complicated functions , code strictly followed DRY principle",1211599,-1,8112
No Changes in the code from the last time. Code is written properly.,1212221,-1,8112
The code is nicely written overall. It follows Ruby guidelines and DRY principle. It would be better if more comments are written.,1214107,1,8112
"The code is well-written and follows good programming style, has good naming and is DRY. The team has not implemented any suggested changes since there has been no commit after first round.",1213896,1,8112
"Code was well written, DRY, and intuitively done. Easy to follow the functionality implemented.",1213550,-1,8112
No new commits have been made in round 2.,1214493,-1,8112
All the commits were completed by Oct 31,1214171,-1,8112
No commits were done in 2nd round.,1212740,-1,8112
the last commit I see is from Oct 31st.I'm assuming they did not have to change much in the 2nd round,1211600,-1,8112
"The last commit I see was 23 days ago, which seems that there wernt many changes done in the seond round. The wiki mentions the suggestions at the end, so it would have been good to have the code changes and tests for the same.",1213462,1,8112
"No Commit,",1212222,-1,8112
A small amount of new code was committed in the second round.,1212187,-1,8112
No new commits were made during the second round.,1214108,-1,8112
"No new commits have been made since the last round. However, there is nothing significant as just codeclimate fixes are remaining.",1213897,-1,8112
"I couldn't any new  commits in the second submission, though the functionality seemed to be fulfilled in the first round itself.",1213551,-1,8112
The team could have added more test cases as they have mentioned about refactoring the code. The refactored code and the screenshots of the test cases would have been better to display in the wiki for future students.,1213464,1,8112
The team has added tests and the coverage improved by a small percentage. More tests can be added to further improve coverage,1214173,1,8112
"Yes, the coverage has increased and has almost reached to 50%.",1212742,-1,8112
"This project is refactoring and there were not much of functionality changes, I see that teams have changed the existing tests make sure there is no coverage miss",1211602,-1,8112
test cases were not part of the requirement doc. Test plan added in the wiki. Could have added more negative test cases.,1212224,1,8112
"The test coverage seems to have increased slightly. Since this is a refactoring project, I wouldn't expect testing to be the focus, so that's pretty good even though the added test case most likely doesn't cover all the work done here.",1212189,-1,8112
"The team had added a test case in the last round, which I think was sufficient to test basic functionality.  There have been no additions to test cases in the second round.",1213899,-1,8112
"Team added several test cases, and the coverage was seen to increase",1213553,-1,8112
Yes the code addresses all issues.,1214496,-1,8112
"I feel that the project could cover more test cases which would have explained the functionality better. The sql that has been mentioned, could have no results as well, so covering negative results would have been better.",1213465,1,8112
Most of the functionalities that were required have been implemented but the final changes haven't been merged due to some build issues on Travis CI. The tests are quite comprehensive,1214174,1,8112
"Yes, refactoring did not impact on the existing operation at all.",1211603,-1,8112
I can't really tell how to navigate to this portion of the project in the application. The writeup is not descriptive enough for me to know where to go to test it.,1212190,1,8112
The system operation works as intended.,1214111,-1,8112
"Yes, this is a refactoring project and the UI works as it is supposed to, after their code changes. All the functionalities seem to be intact. Good job there!",1213900,-1,8112
The system operation works as intended from the link provided.,1213554,-1,8112
The team has explained the issue and the solution they chose with enough   details to understand to way of implementation.,1214497,-1,8112
"I found the write up to be same. There is more scope to improve it with more explanation and test cases, specially the links to the refactored codes could be added for the other teams to know.",1213466,1,8112
"The writeup is clear and has illustrations to explain the flow. However, none of the code is added to the documentation. The project also only defines the test added but could add more details about the increase in coverage",1214175,1,8112
"The authors should have added screenshots for the changes made in the code. Otherwise, the purpose and work done has been explained well.",1212744,1,8112
"overall it is well written, they can add reference section where they can put the link to the project etc.",1211604,-1,8112
"The writeup leaves me unable to really determine what was done to the point where I can examine the work in their application for correctness, especially since, as a refactor, the behavior should not have changed from the base expertiza application.",1212191,1,8112
The writeup is good overall. But it would have been better if more code snippets were added along with explanation of why certain methods are obsolete.,1214112,1,8112
The write-up is to the point and explains their approach neatly. The team has made efforts to update the write-up with the provided suggestions and it has improved the write-up.,1213901,-1,8112
"The writeup was elaborate, and fully elucidated the test added and the removed methods and SQL lines and their scope. ",1213555,-1,8112
Yes  I think with additional testing it can be deployed.,1214498,1,8112
"The code is written in a modular way but there are some errors as shown by the CI. If these are fixed, it can be merged with the main project",1214176,1,8112
I feel there are more number of test cases that need to be covered before deploying this in PROD.,1213467,1,8112
I strongly believe that this code is ready for production server,1211605,-1,8112
Changes are working perfectly.,1212227,-1,8112
"I think this code is ready to go, because it is better organized and structured than it used to be.",1212192,-1,8112
"I think that it is a neatly written code and once the integration issues have been resolved, it should be ready to be deployed on th production server.  The code being readable, can be easily picked up by the future team.",1213902,-1,8112
"The code build passes the travis CI test and it has not  conflicts with the base branch. However, the team should resolve warnings.",1214494,1,8112
"The build seems to have passed, but there are not many test cases listed to check the same. There is more scope of test cases in the same.",1213463,1,8112
"Most of the tests passed. However, a small fraction of the tests have failed and the code needs to be modified to incorporate these changes",1214172,1,8112
Travis CI test has been failed on Github.,1212741,1,8112
build is passing on Travis CI. there are no pending conflicts,1211601,-1,8112
Few issues with the build but I feel they are trivial.,1212223,1,8112
Ignoring this question since it is an OSS project.,1213898,-1,8112
The pull request did not pass the automatic build requirements. It seems as though this team worked very hard to try to fix the build errors.,1212188,1,8112
"Though there were several build fails during the first round which seem to have been triggered on bundle exec, the final build passes in Travis CI",1213552,-1,8112
Unable to login to the expertiza url,1211716,1,8106
The code is not altered much but it follows the standards and not changed in the second round,1214226,-1,8106
Code is written well with simplified approach. Naming conventions are standard without long functions. DRY principle is followed.,1211885,-1,8106
"The code is well written. Although as suggested earlier, the team has not added comments to the code. In the wiki page, the team displays of how the code was before and after. But, I still feel this is not adequate information for a layman to be able to follow line by line what the code does. Adding comments in the code for future projects would be my best suggestion. Or, as an alternative, briefly explain in a line or 2 as to what the code does.",1214058,1,8106
"Well, the code looks good and very much follows the Ruby Style Guide. The code also is DRY. It looks well written and does not any changes.",1211515,-1,8106
"Code written well. Remove the unwanted methods, there are few duplicate methods which can be removed.",1212235,1,8106
"The code was well-written and no problem with long or bad names. But, no comments were present. Commenting would have made the code easier to understand. Also, refactoring was not done.",1214261,1,8106
"The code hasnt been changed from the first round. New definitions that were added follow naming conventions properly. remove_administrator remove_instructor Viewing their pull request and code climate bot, there were few places where identical blocks of code can be found.But they are in the spec files.They could have refactored those areas alone.",1212487,1,8106
"The code is really well written , there are no bad names. The functions are also easy to understand. However, I would suggest them to include more comments in the code so that it becomes clear for the person reading the code that what the function and changes are all bout.",1211424,1,8106
New code commit was not made in second round,1214227,-1,8106
"Could not see any commits after the last submission as functionalities were working fine, but team could have worked upon improving test coverage.",1211886,-1,8106
"No, no new code was committed during 2nd round.",1211516,-1,8106
"No new code was committed in the second round. I would have really appreciated it if the team could have taken the time to add comments, and fix some ""codeclimate"" issues.",1214059,1,8106
No Commits,1212236,-1,8106
No new code was committed during the 2nd round.,1214262,-1,8106
"Team s last commit was on Oct 31st , which was the first deadline.",1212488,-1,8106
I see really less commits in the second round. The last commit was on 31st October. It would have been really nice if they have worked on the project further to enhance the work they have done.,1211425,1,8106
"Same test plan as previous phase is present , no new cases added",1214229,1,8106
"Team has added capybara test. but team could have worked upon improving test coverage. Team can explain test description in test plan in wiki, step by step so as to understand what all test scenarios were covered.",1211888,1,8106
The test cases added by the team pass. But overall coverage has decreased. I would suggest the team to have added more test cases for the new lines added in the controllers.,1214061,1,8106
"The team has added test cases. But, they haven't explained it well",1211518,1,8106
The team added the test cases but the coverage did not increase. Overall coverage decreased (-1.04%) to 46.605%,1214264,1,8106
Good Job on the test cases.,1212238,-1,8106
The team had added test cases in the first round of submission itself. The overall coverage has decreased by 1.04%. The test covers the logic implemented by the students.But reduces the overall coverage. The team did a good work in using Capybara and testing the web functionalities too.  ,1212490,1,8106
"Yes, test cases were written for admin_controller and roles_controller. The test cases increased the coverage as well. Every method in these files are tested and covers a good range of this project.",1211427,-1,8106
The changes works as per the changes. Test does not cover entire scope,1214230,1,8106
"When open from the UI, working fine and as expected. No refactoring required.  ",1211889,-1,8106
"Yes, the system operation works well. All the functionalities mentioned work properly.",1211519,-1,8106
Code works.,1212239,-1,8106
"Yes, the system works fine and as intended. The features work as they are supposed to.",1214265,-1,8106
"Everything works from their UI. Their peer review plan works as intended and clearly explains how to test on UI. There are SQL errors when trying to delete a user which is tied to some assignment. Although the team has mentioned it is out of scope of the project, future work could be to remove those SQL error displayed on pages and give a pop up / alert box, saying your user is tied to an assignment.",1212491,1,8106
They had to create a superuser who has a right to delete other users . When checked these functionalities were working upto 80% expectation. The tests written do cover the portion assigned to them and the tests are thorough.,1211428,-1,8106
The writeup is well written but not as explanatory as required,1214231,1,8106
"Writeup is written well and explained properly with good indentation, content and screenshots. Team could have explained test plan in more brief so as to understand number of test scenarios covered. ",1211890,1,8106
Unfortunately the authors have not added any more text to improve the writeup as suggested in the first round of reviews.,1214063,1,8106
"It is well written, quite understandable. It clearly and adequately indicates the working functionality. I can understand what the project is about.",1211520,-1,8106
Very well written.,1212240,-1,8106
The write-up is well organized but it would have been better if some screenshots were uploaded along with the steps. That would have made the document easier to understand.,1214266,-1,8106
"The writeup is short and precise - has everything that is needed for testing and understanding and kept the writeup small for better understanding. They have mentioned about their DRY principle within ""Changes"" itself. Mentioning it as a separate sub topic will give more visibility is what I felt. Other than that everything is self explanatory.",1212492,-1,8106
"The writeup is well written. It covers almost all the work done. However, one suggestion would be to include more details about hoe the tests were done. I just one small portion dedicated to explanation of RSpec and not the work implemented.",1211429,-1,8106
No it should go through more edge cases testing,1214232,-1,8106
"Yes.From the system and code, these code changes seem ready to be deployed in production after heavy integration testing as issues seem to be working, but github pull request shows more fixes to work upon.",1211891,1,8106
"Although as per functionality, this code is ready to be merged and the team did put in a fair amount of work into it. Still, I believe this project can be bettered by another team in the future by refactoring some the code to improve code writing principles and also improve the wiki documentation.",1214064,1,8106
"As mentioned above, the functionalities work well. So, yeah this can deployed on the production server.",1211521,-1,8106
"After fixing the issues suggested by code climate, the code can be deployed.",1212241,-1,8106
The code seems ready to be deployed as the features are working as intended but it would have been better if the code was refactored.,1214267,1,8106
"The code can be readily merged into production. 1) I felt code climate failing not an issue, because their similar blocks of code were on spec files and deleting 2 different roles is the same functionality in the end. Few places has indentation errors which can be fixed before merging. As suggested earlier, removing the error for SQL and replacing with some form of alert box could be helpful for a future work.",1212493,1,8106
"The code is very well written as previously said. However, some test cases are still not passing and that may be troublesome if deployed onto production server. It would be a really nice opportunity for students in further classes take this up and improve the work so that they can complete the work which was left incomplete due to time constraints.",1211430,1,8106
"The build does not pass, but only because of codeclimate issues. The code written by the team, in terms of logic is absolutely perfect. But certain conventions were not followed, such as ""proper indentation was not followed"", ""DRY principle violated"". Although these have no impact on the functionality, these coding practices are industry convention and maybe the team would want to consider giving them equal importance for the next projects.",1214060,1,8106
Pull request build passed well and there are no issues.,1211517,-1,8106
Build is not passed. Build failed Travis CI. Team can work to fix suggestion given on the pull request. ,1211887,1,8106
I coud see only few builds passed the Travis Cl. There are many builds that are failing and should be worked on.,1211426,1,8106
The pull request has passed the Travis CI,1212489,-1,8106
"The build passed in Travis CI and there were no conflicts. But, some issues are not fixed like refactoring is not done and block has too many lines. These issues should be considered for a well written code.",1214263,1,8106
Issues with the build Can be fixed quickly. Issues seem trivial.,1212237,1,8106
Build did not pass. Version compatible code can be written,1214228,1,8106
The overall structure of the code looks good and all the coding standards have been followed.,1213868,-1,8050
"Yes,coding practices seem upto standards",1212348,-1,8050
"Yes, the code already followed all the good conventions earlier, except the lack of proper comments. The code still lacks comments, and the author hasn't made any changes since the last review. But the overall code quality is upto the mark.",1213861,1,8050
"The code quality is good however, it can be improved significantly. The code lacks proper comments and contains many if else statements. They could have been refactored and avoided.",1212242,1,8050
A better explanation on the test cases would have made sure that the code is ready. I feel that some more tests need to be done before deploying the code.,1213175,1,8089
"Yes , it can be deployed and is a good starting point for teams in the future.",1212462,-1,8089
There are a few issues regarding code repetition and extra white space (especially in the controller rspec file).,1212585,1,8050
Overall the quality of code is great. There some variable which does not follow naming convection.,1212921,1,8050
The code is ready to be deployed on production server with few caveats. At some places values and logic is hardcoded. This project would be a really good starting point for further work.,1212305,1,8089
I think the code can be merged. All the test cases seem to cover the edge cases and my testing shows that the things function as expected.,1211465,-1,8089
The code is well written and well commented and follows ruby style guide.,1212970,-1,8050
"The code is functionally ready to be deployed in the production server, because it is sound and even passes the build of Travis CI. There are a few minor issues due to Cognitive Complexity of names of methods, lines of code and a few indentation errors. If they are fixed, the code is complete and will pass the build of codeclimate as well. The team has proceeded in the correct approach and there is no need for the project to be redone from scratch using a different approach.",1212906,1,8089
Yes it is ready to be deployed.,1213345,-1,8089
"The team has covered the implementation of the points given in the problem statement. However, testing of the project is necessary. This is one of the point which cold be worked on by the future team. According to codeclimate, there are 7 issues which need to be fixed as well. The future team could improve on those points.",1212010,1,8089
"Code looks okay, Suggestions for improvements not done.  build still fails   ",1214135,-1,8050
"From the file diff in GitHub, it looks the code is in good shape. There were a few suggestions provided during round 1 review. If those could also be integrated, it would be better. The test cases are successfully running. But the functionality could not be tested due to lack for steps in the wiki. ",1214246,1,8089
"The build seems to pass, but it would have been great if the test cases were explained better. Maybe some screenshots or a video would have been easier to test.",1213171,1,8089
"The code is well-written, follows code standards. The naming conventions are followed. However, in some parts code is not formatted. ",1212606,1,8050
Yes travis CI is passing. Code climate has few issues but they can be easily resolved.,1212454,1,8089
"The code is well written, follows ruby guidelines and variables are aptly named. However, the changes are extensive and there are virtually no comments. The code can do with significantly more comments to explain what is being done.",1211793,1,8050
They don't have code problem for the first round.,1211983,-1,8050
No the new code was not committed during the second round. This could be due to the fact that the team finished their code at the end of the first round itself.,1213869,-1,8050
Doesn't seem to have new commits in round 2. last commit was on 2nd November,1212349,-1,8050

The code seems to same as before. nothing new has been added.,1212351,-1,8050
The code has passed the Travis CI build has passed. The danger build has also passed with one warning because of more that 500 Lines of Code. On the other hand the codeclimate build has failed with 7 issues to fix.  1. There is a method get_feedback_assessments_for which has a Cognitive Complexity of 9 (which exceeds 5) and must be refactored. 2. The model class Team contains 21 methods (which is more than the 20 allowed) and hence has to be refactored. 3. The method view_heatgrid has 28 Lines of code that exceeds the allowed 20 and hence has to be refactored. 4. The method set_content has a Cognitive Complexity of 6 (which exceeds the allowed 5) and hence has to be refactored 5. Presence of an unescaped model attribute in the file app/views/response/view.html.erb 6. Assignment Branch condition size for get_feedback_assessments_for is too high 7.

Build passed. codeclimate - 7 issues to fix. 2/3 checks were passed. Issues seem trivial.,1213341,1,8089
The build has passed and there have not been any conflicts.,1212006,-1,8089
The team has added test cases and they cover all the required functionality. The code coverage has increased by a small amount.,1212245,-1,8050

They did add the test-cases but the coverage only increased by .3 %,1212924,-1,8050
Overall coverage increased (+0.3%) to 37.074% Good work on including test cases. The app works fine after testing. The newly added tests cover the scope of this project very well.,1212973,-1,8050
yes good number of tests added coverage increased a but but i would like to see more -ve tests. Mostly +ve test cases are covered in the tests    ,1214138,1,8050
"Team has added many tests. Coverage has increased from 1 to 38%, which is impressive. ",1212609,-1,8050

Yes everything does seem to work properly. ,1213872,-1,8050
Seems to be working as intended. But all the features have not been implemented. The documentation mentions future work but no new code has been added.,1212352,-1,8050
"Yes, the project did work as intended. The video demonstration and manual testing were enough to prove this fact.",1213865,-1,8050
The system works well. All the functionality has been implemented. I ran the project and it worked as intended. The back button issue in UI has been fixed.,1212246,-1,8050

"Yes, it works as intended.",1212925,-1,8050
Very good guidance. Works as intended. This project is about enhancing Juniper bookmarks. The features work as they are supposed to. Automated RSpec tests were added. Could have described the automated tests in the wiki.,1212974,1,8050
yes ,1214139,-1,8050
"Yes, as mentioned in the problem statement, the solution is delivered. It works fine. ",1212610,-1,8050
"Yes, everything works.",1211987,-1,8050
The functionality works and is evidenced by the video.,1211797,-1,8050
The writeup written well. The team could have included snippets of their code instead of screenshots.,1213873,1,8050
"The solution of problem 1 was not clear from the write up, no explanation has been given.",1212353,1,8050
"The write-up was very good, in the sense that it mentioned the high level view of the tasks first, and then dug deeper under the hood. But, it only showed what files they changed, and what it produced as a result. They could have also shown what is that they changed, or provided a link in the wiki. Yes, one can deduce that from the pull request too, but having a link or the content itself on the wiki is a big boon.",1213866,1,8050
"The writeup needs significant improvement. ""No clear explanation is given as to which files are edited for which reason. Only file names are stated along with changes made. Why the changes were made and what do those changes correct is not given."" - This review was given by me last time,and no improvement has been made in this regard.",1212247,1,8050
A lot of outdated approaches were used. Refactoring was needed.,1213318,-1,8055
Code is very neat and readable. I appreciate you attention to following good syntax practices. There is some similar code was exists in the controller action method and the content page method but simple to bring out and make dry. Overall great job.,1214177,1,8055
The code was written pretty well.,1211501,-1,8055
"The code is well written with proper naming conventions and proper size of functions. However, i would only suggest that they should include proper comments so that it increases the readability of the code.",1212501,0,8055
"The code is well-structured, the team uses context and it properly to separate different cases and using each to make the code DRY. However, it seems the object used to test are not all stored in the factories file properly.",1212928,1,8055
No commits needed after first review.,1213086,-1,8055
The last commit was listed as 12 days prior to this review. But the code looks to be in great shape so there was no need for new additions.,1214178,1,8055
No new commits. No new bug fixed.,1211502,-1,8055
 The last commit was 12 days ago. I believe that this team had finished their work well before round 1 itself. I think they had planned the work well in advance and followed that plan as well.,1212831,-1,8055
There were really few commits in the 2nd round. The only commit I could see was on 30th October. The only suggestion I would give is to continuously update their work on git. ,1212502,-1,8055
There is no new commit during the 2nd round.,1212929,-1,8055
"No new test cases added, but the existing ones had a good coverage too.",1213088,-1,8055
Overall test coverage  was decreased by 35%.,1213321,-1,8055
No need for adding new test cases as the previous submission already achieved 100% coverage. I apologize for not being certain how to accurately answer this question.,1214180,-1,8055
"They didn't add test cases, but the test coverage is always above 90%.",1211504,-1,8055
There are no new tests and that is because the team had already completed their work before deadline 1 and the coverage was 100% on the deadline one itself so there is basically no scope for improvement for this team.,1212833,-1,8055
"The team did add test cases. They achieved a little more than the desired coverage even , that means they have done a great work.",1212504,-1,8055
The team added test cases for menu.rb and the coverage increases but the overall coverage seems decrease due to that.,1212931,-1,8055
"From the video, the functionality works well.",1213322,-1,8055
N/A. This is a unit test project.,1211505,-1,8055
"Yes, the tests cover all the scenarios.",1211980,-1,8055
The tests cover most of the scenarios as is evident from their mutant killing capabilities. ,1212834,-1,8055
The team was asked to write test cases and get a coverage of around 90%. The team did a really good job in writing test cases for all the methods present in the assigned files.,1212505,-1,8055
The project has a good coverage of the codes ,1212932,-1,8055
The writeup is well documented,1213323,-1,8055
The write up is very informative and clearly shows the impact and result of the project tests. It would have been a great addition to have included more discussion on the design choices of your testcases and how it was implemented. Overall a great wiki.,1214182,-1,8055
The writeup is pretty good and easy to follow.,1211506,-1,8055
I loved the write-up. Write from the beginning to explaining Expertiza to explaining their task and the test plan which was very detailed and methodical. I also like that they had included a screen shot of the Mutant test which shows the thoroughness of their tests. Overall an impressive job by the authors.,1212835,-1,8055
The writeup is well written and clearly tells the flow and method of working. It shows clearly what all work is done and how it is done. It mentions specifically the explanation of each functionality and how it is checked.,1212506,-1,8055
"The writeup gives an easy-understanding introduction of the two classes the team needed to test. Also, there is detailed test plan is provided. The wiki also shows how the test cases are designed and the results. However, for the motivation part, it is a little bit general, which needs to add more things specific for this project.",1212933,-1,8055
a Lot of refactoring is required before the code goes on to production server.,1213324,-1,8055
Not ready. There are still a few errors in Travis CI and code climate.,1211507,1,8055
"As mentioned above, they can make it better by fixing some issues.",1211982,1,8055
The travis test had failed and codeclimate shows indentation and other such minor errors. I think that the team just needs to work on the styling and following some Ruby guidelines and they are good to go.,1212836,1,8055
"The project is almost on the stage that it can be deployed on the production server. However, there are few test cases that are failing as shown on the git. If these minor flaws are fixed then the code is good to go.",1212507,1,8055
The team gives a good guidelines for how to test and what to test for the two classes.,1212934,-1,8055
Travis CI failed.,1213087,-1,8055
The travis CI build failed.,1213320,-1,8055
"There is a minor code climate error as mentioned above, similar code. An easy fix and you will be green with the climate check.",1214179,1,8055
The build didn't pass in Travis CI. There is still an error.,1211503,1,8055
"They did a good job and they can make it better by fixing some issues . According to the pull request page, the Travis CI build failed and there are 5 code climate issues to fix",1211978,1,8055
The pull request is the same as the previous one. And as in the case of the previous one it fails.,1212832,1,8055
"The code passes almost all Travis CI . However, there are really few which fail.",1212503,1,8055
The code was not much changed after the first round. They added a few more sanitation check and rspec. Functions are not long enough and understandable.,1212018,1,8081
I think the code looks good and very much follows the Ruby Style Guide. The code also is DRY. It looks well written and does not any changes.,1211529,-1,8081
 The code is extremly well-written.,1212886,-1,8081
Videos and code explained very well.,1212256,-1,8081
Overall the code looks good with most of the coding standards being followed. However I think it lacks proper commenting and also there were few stray pieces of commented out code lying around. Adding few more comments and deleting unused code would be better.,1213078,1,8081
Yes some of the issues were fixed.,1212641,-1,8081
"The code was written clearly, DRY, and intuitive to follow the intended functionality.",1213826,-1,8081
There were not any bad naming in round 1 as well. Comments could have been added for new additions which is still missing. There has been no DRY issues,1212858,1,8081
Yes rspec and few changes were committed,1212019,-1,8081
"Yes, a lot of commits were made mostly to fix the issues pointed out by the CI tools",1211432,-1,8081
"Yes, there were many parts of the code committed during round 2.",1211530,-1,8081
5 new commits were made during second round,1212887,-1,8081
Yes,1212257,-1,8081
The team has a really good job of committing their code on a regular basis. There has been some code commits even in the 2nd round. ,1213079,-1,8081
"Yes, there were few new commits",1213051,-1,8081
Yes there were some commits fixing the travis and code climate issues.,1212642,1,8081
"Yes, the team actively committed to the project during the second round.",1213827,-1,8081
Test cases added but the video is not very explanatory in itself to understand the test plan.,1212021,1,8081
The team seems to have thoroughly tested the use case and the coverage has increased.,1211434,-1,8081
"Yes, the team has added test cases and it covers all the functionalities and issues.",1211532,-1,8081
No new test cases were added,1212889,1,8081
Video showing test cases passed. Good Job!,1212259,-1,8081
"YEs, the team has included the relevant test cases to test their changes and the overall coverage has increased by 0.04% which I think covers the scope of this project.",1213081,-1,8081
Coverage increased by 0.04%,1213053,-1,8081
Automated and manual tests have been added and coverage has increased by a very tiny amount.,1212644,1,8081
Yes the team did add test cases that increased coverage. They are appropriate for the scope of the project.,1213829,-1,8081
Yes the team has added test for the UTF encoding acceptance. the coverage is not 100% and not tested with varied inputs but i believe would suffice for sanity check. Although the description of test in rspec file is ambiguous not clearly mentioning what exactly the test is expected to do. There is no test available for the issue 2 documented,1212861,1,8081
Videos provided and the project is not deployed so cannot test from UI. But the issues are fixed and the system is working as expected. ,1212022,1,8081
My testing shows things seem to be working as expected and documented.,1211435,-1,8081
The deployment link hasn't been provided. Though they have put videos for the same,1211533,-1,8081
It works as intended.,1212890,-1,8081
Yes code works.,1212260,-1,8081
"From the video links that have been shared, it is very clear that the features are working as they were supposed to. Even the test cases are passing. I see no issues with this part.",1213082,-1,8081
It was not deployed so couldn't check manually,1213054,1,8081
Looking from videos all the intended features work,1212645,-1,8081
Yes the code works has expected. it accepts the utf-8 codes now and also parses HTML tags in reviews like expected,1212862,-1,8081
The write-up is well written explaining all the steps undertaken to make desired changes and displaying how the system works after the changes have been made (with screenshots). They have also added Test plans in the wiki page,1212023,-1,8081
Pretty nicely written Wiki. Test Plan also describes how various tests were performed.,1211436,-1,8081
"It is well written, quite understandable. It clearly and adequately indicates the working functionality. I can understand what the project is about.",1211534,-1,8081
Write-up is little vague. Some are not explained properly.,1212891,1,8081
"Yes the write up is good, if they were able to host it'd have been better for checking the work. ",1212646,-1,8081
"The write up is well written, elaborate, and clearly elucidates both the manual test cases considered as well as the automated tests implemented. Screenshots of both cases were also included as well. Steps for manual testing were clearly written.",1213831,-1,8081
The team has considerably improved the write-up. The write-up was very inefficient and dint provide details of the code-base also the video was encoded and impossible to view in Round 1. The team has rectified all these issues with round 2. they have documented their fixed more clearly with screen shots and code this time. ,1212863,-1,8081
"It can be deployed but first, it should be tested thoroughly. ",1212024,-1,8081
I think the changes are tested nicely and seem to cover all the necessary cases. This can be merged into the master branch and is ready for production use,1211437,-1,8081
"Watching the videos, I feel it is ready but no deployment link.",1211535,1,8081
"As It did not pass the test, it is not ready. For a future team, end of this project should be a good starting place.",1212892,1,8081
Its ready to be merged.,1212262,-1,8081
"In my opinion, this team has done pretty good work and the code looks like ready to be deployed on the production server.",1213084,-1,8081
"According to write up, it's good to go but since there is no deployed link I couldn't manually check.",1213056,1,8081
"Yes, just fix the few issues present and that should be fine for it to be merged into main line as the feature seems to work and there isn't any major code issue.",1212647,-1,8081
"I believe this change that affects the system as a whole, needs more test to be performed in all affected tables and functions to be sure, no other part of the system is broken.My opinion is that, once all parts of the system test is done, corresponding to this centralized db change the code can be deployed to production.",1212864,1,8081
Build did pass successfully. Could have written version specific code to avoid errors,1212020,1,8081
Travis says some tests have failed. No conflicts though,1211433,1,8081
Pull request build passes well and there are issues.,1211531,-1,8081
"No, It did not pass travis ci and there are many conflicts that must be resolved.",1212888,1,8081
Few minor issues with the build which can be ignored.,1212258,1,8081
"The build has successfully passed the Travis CI test and there are no merge conflicts present in the pull request. However, there were a few code climate issues which I think can be easily fixed.",1213080,-1,8081
"No, build pass did not pass Travis CI",1213052,1,8081
The travis ci test passes.,1212643,-1,8081
The build passed in Travis CI with no conflicts.,1213828,-1,8081
Not all changes has been verified successfully. few code climates rejects has happened as well. ,1212860,1,8081
"The write up is good, contains lots of pictures to show the added functionality. I found the test steps a bit confusing and it made validation hard.",1212590,-1,8050
The writeup is well written and self explanatory. ,1212926,-1,8050
"The write-up is very detailed with comparisons between previous and new versions, as to what features have been implemented but lacks on explaining how they are implemented. It can be improved by adding how the features have been implemented, why they chose this logic to implement the features.",1212975,1,8050
"the Writeup misses out on elaborating the approach taken, it just lists the problem statement and jumps to test cases and fix. I would like to see more details on the approach taken.  The ""why"" is missing   ",1214140,0,8050
"Documentation mentions the steps, problem statement, solutions and screenshots. The description are detailed. However, I feel there is no need to give screenshots for tests written. ",1212611,-1,8050
"The write-up is well written and looks through. The write-up details what has been accomplished and there are plenty of screenshots to support this. However, there is no mention of what code has been changed/added and why the authors chose this change.  Test plan has also been well written. The parts written are well written, but there's a good scope of improvement.",1211798,1,8050
"The writeup is great, in first round they did not have a test plan part. But they added it in the second part.",1211988,-1,8050
"Since the Travis test has failed, merging the code would not be a good idea. The project doesn't need to be redone from scratch, some modifications to the existing work could make the project ready for deployment.",1213874,1,8050
"No, all the features have not been implemented e.g 1. A reviewer can be recognized or credited if he added useful bookmarks i.e if the author has made use of the bookmark. 2. A function to add badges automatically if a participant had submitted more than threshold number of useful bookmarks. plus build did not pass as well",1212354,1,8050
"Yes, the code seems good to deploy if we consider the manual testing and the video demonstration. But since it didn't pass Travis CI, this claims seems a bit of a concern. If we ignore the fact that lines of code was >500, and thats why Travis CI failed, but still there are a few lingering issues which the Travis CI pointed, which still hasn't been fixed. It seems more of a patch, which would require more patches to patch in the future.",1213867,1,8050
"This code will need to be refactored, however, we will not need to build it from scratch. Only some functionality has to be divided into chunks and moved into helper functions. The functionality works well.",1212248,1,8050
The code looks good.,1212591,-1,8050
"No, its not as the coverage is increases by small amount.",1212927,-1,8050
No issues codewise. Can add test cases and after thorough testing It can be deployed. Yes other team can take up and fix the minor issues and build pass.,1212976,1,8050
"build fails that needs to be investigated , once that is done i dont see why the project cannot be merged with the mail branch. Loot of good work has been done and merge with the main branch would bring the work to fruition.  ",1214141,-1,8050
"No. I do not think the code is ready to be deployed. I found the code change hard to understand, there are no comments and neither has the logic or rationale behind the new/changed code been given in the wiki. Besides, the build fails and there are a host of issues that need to be fixed.  Although all this might only be trivial issues and can be fixed rather easily, the code as of now, is not deployment-ready according to me. ",1211799,1,8050
"The code has been merged in a good way and there have been no merge conflicts. However, the Travis CI was failing and the code climate check was failing too. This is something that the team must look into and make sure that the changes that they have made are consistent with the existing expertiza code. ",1213870,1,8050
Travis CI did not pass. Code climate also has 121 issues to fix.,1212350,1,8050
"No, the Travis CI had failed. Yes, there were a few conflicts, like the lines of code was very large for a commit (>500), also there were a few pending test cases in the pull request.",1213863,1,8050
The build did not pass in Travis CI. There were no conflicts that needed to be resolved.,1212244,1,8050
"The build isn't passing one of the added tests, but it looks to be a simple fix. ",1212587,1,8050
Yes there is one conflict that must be resolved to go ahead reported by TRAVIS CI.,1212923,1,8050
Travis CI build is failing. Lot of warnings and issues that have not been fixed. Many of them are trivial and easy to fix. ,1212972,1,8050
Build fails. pls check the same. There are no conflicts with the mail branch. ,1214137,1,8050
"Travis test has failed, I can see it in pull request page. Conflict has not been resolved. ",1212608,1,8050
Build fails and there are aa plethora of issues (121 by code climate) and several warnings.,1211795,1,8050
"The build did not pass, their test failed. It seems that their grades_controller_spec.rb has some problems.",1211985,1,8050
"Code is short, variables and functions are well-named.",1212935,-1,8020
"the code is very well written. there are no bad names, long functions or any lack of comments. The code written by the team is self-explanatory.",1213033,-1,8020
The code follows the DRY principles correctly,1212494,-1,8020
"The variables, methods and class names are aptly named. I could not find names which are not suggestive of functionality. (i) The writeup is well written and easy to read and well commented (ii) It is adequately descriptive of the work done. (iii) Explanation of reasons for the style of code and problem solving approach is lacking.",1213092,-1,8020
The code is concise and easy to understand. The team has provided comments to explain the logic of the new function created which really helps.,1211962,-1,8020
The code was well-written in the first round itself and followed good coding standards.,1214051,-1,8020
The code was already well-written . No changes were suggested in the first round. The team did a great work in following coding best practices. ,1213176,-1,8020
A few bug fixes were made after the first round of submissions,1212495,-1,8020
"There were only 2 commits made during the second round. However, the team had mostly implemented most of the functionality during the first round, maybe due to which there are less commits in the second round",1211963,-1,8020
There are no new commits during second round.,1214052,1,8020
The team did change the project as there are 2 new commits. The CI build is still failing .,1213177,1,8020
The team has added test cases but the coverage did not increase by much,1212497,1,8020
The Ui and system operations works well as intended. They newly added features works perfectly as they are supposed to do.,1213037,-1,8020
Everything works as expected except for the case mentioned above.,1212939,-1,8020
Some of the functionalities have been implemented but the pull request is yet to be merged with the master branch,1212498,-1,8020
"No credential provided for login. Hence, couldn't check.",1213145,1,8020
The write-up clearly mentions how to check/test the work done by the team. it includes almost everything the team has changed during their project.  It clearly mentions the filenames where the changes have been made. All the references are also included in the write-up  ,1213038,-1,8020
"The team has provided an excellent write-up with proper explanation of the problem statement and the solutions they have provided. The team has also included  a video which make things really easy to understand. The team has shown navigation structure of the expertiza menu, which makes the workflow clear.",1211967,-1,8020
The write-up is well written and organised. Everything looks fine. The team should have mentioned about the approach taken to solve the mentioned problem statement which will make the implementation easier to understand. Also the screenshots could be a little better.,1213181,1,8020
"The code has mast elements ready but there can be more test cases generated with better test coverage. The code need not be rewritten from scratch, it just needs to include some more of the expected functionality",1212500,1,8020
According to write-up and video yes but since I couldn't manually check I would say no.,1213147,1,8020
"There must be some test cases that should have been covered according to Travis CI. Also the build has failed. However, the team claims that some of the tests are running locally. If some of these points are looked upon, the code would be ready to be deployed on the main server.",1211968,1,8020
the code looks fine. The only concern is related to the CI build which is failing at the moment. Some of the tests are failing because of the change. ,1213182,1,8020
the build fails and there is one warning and one error which needs to be fixed.,1213035,1,8020
"There are build failures mentioned but I don't think the errors are due to this team's code, hence, giving them the benefit of doubt.",1212937,1,8020
"There were some build issues raised by Travis CI which have not been handled yet. However, there are no merge conflicts with the master branch.",1212496,1,8020
No pull request link is provided ,1213143,1,8020
Travis failed,1211447,1,8020
No build did not pass. 1/3 checks very successful. It is fixable and the issues are trivial.,1213094,1,8020
The build in Travis CI failed. 3 out of the 4 build jobs had passed. The build job failed in the features folder. The branch did not have any conflicts with the main branch,1211964,1,8020
The CI build was failing in the previous submission as well in the new submission. The team should have corrected the same.,1213178,1,8020
Nice work!,1214165,-1,8033
All passed.,1214334,-1,8033
"Yes, the build passes Travis CI. No, it did not had any conflicts. There was only one message, which was a warning, but apart from that, it everything seemed perfect.",1214046,1,8033
"Yes, they have passed the Travis CI.",1211573,-1,8033
"The code us good as mentioned in the previous rounds, except the lack of proper commenting. The authors did not improve the code from the previous rounds in this aspect.",1214156,1,8124
"The code is well written according to the video. Since there's no github submission, I went to the sumitter in the pull request to check his work. It seems that the code is relatively good. There's some minor indentation and alignment issue. And not much explaining comments. But other than that, no bad name, no long function.",1214598,1,8124

The write up has some great information and snip its of code. It would have been a great addition to have included more discussion on the overall design of your test cases. Overall a nice wiki.,1214154,1,8124
"This is where the project lacks the mos. The write-up isn't very informative, specially for an outsider. It states the points very shortly, without going into much depth. Also, the writeup bombards the user with lots of un-relevant information and pieces of code, which make it feel very long, although lacking significant content.

"It is very difficult to recommend merging this code. Although it builds and appears to function correctly, it is not properly documented. It is difficult to tell how the code works and whether test cases introduced actually function as they intend.",1213860,1,8124
"As soon as they fix code climate issue, and separate each test cases with more it '......' do, it is good to deploy. ",1214008,1,8124
The team has presented a working deployment to be possible. It passes most of the builds and can be deployed on the production server. ,1212403,-1,8124
It can be merged after fixing the code climate which has 7 issues(needs to follow the coding standards )and need to work upon the overall decreased code coverage.,1213224,1,8124

The source code is mostly written in a coherent way and is straightforward to follow.  The 'context' blocks are extensively used which increases the project documentation. The commented chunks of code blocks that were present in the 1st round are mostly removed. There are still a few instances left and I would suggest to remove them because they reduce the overall readability. I would also suggest to decompose the 'it' block inside the '.final_versions_from_reviewer' by moving the common setup to a before(:each) block and spreading the assertions across several 'it' statements.  Another improvement would be to remove the 'xit' code blocks because they only increase the clutter and do not add any value to the code. Adding one comment explaining why the blocks are no longer necessary would do the job.,1212144,1,8125

max_choosers name was not changed. As far as i understand it denotes the maximum number of slots and should be called max_slots. which is not changed. Apart from this code is good.,1212718,1,8043

This version clearly defines each test case and in some instances elaborates on the inner workings of the blocks for example "".import"" Method discussion. However, design principles and patterns that were used in this project are still missing from the writeup.  One thing that stands out in the code is that every mock object is defined at the start of the file. The team could provide a rationale for this decision and why it is superior to for example using different mocks for each separate test suite.",1212149,1,8125
 I believe this code is ready to be merged once the Travis CI passed.  ,1213916,1,8033
Once travis build passes the project could be merged. I have seen specs in the existing code base that are very implementation dependent so this won't be an issue.,1212990,1,8033

"The write-up is good, but it doesn't feel much refined or improvised after the initial edit. As mentioned above, the image isn't visible clearly, which means that it wasn't reviewed much after posting. But apart frm that, the flow of the write-up is very effective, in fact one of the best that I've reviewed.

The various methods tested on the Node class include initialize, setup, site_controller, controller_action, content_page and add_child. Similarly the methods tested on the Menu class include initialize, select, get_item, get_menu, selected, selected? and crumbs.  The write up also includes the screenshot of the Rspec tests that were run. The screenshot of the SimpleCov coverage report is blurred and not readable.  The write up ends with concluding remarks, learning outcomes and References. Overall, the documentation was very precise and clear with all the information needed to understand the code on Github. The authors could have included and highlighted how to run the Rspec code since their project specifically deals with unit testing. Another apparent issue that I can point out is the quality of screenshot.",1212170,1,8033
The team has done good manual testing but it would help to add few test in features to test the impact of the changes done in functionality of the project.,1211539,1,8043
There has not been any changes after first round in the writeup. So my opinion remains the same as it was in the previous review.,1212604,1,8033
" The writeup overall is good, but they did change the problem related to test plan like I mentioned last time.  ",1213915,1,8033
"The overall coverage decreased, but not significantly. It reduced by 0.01%/",1213390,-1,8043
The writeup is complete and comprehensive in that it fully covers the given functionality. It clearly and adequately indicates the working functionality.,1211869,-1,8033
No new tests were written for this functionality. ,1212819,-1,8043
No New Tests,1212721,-1,8043
The writeup is written in a verbose manner. The test plan is also mentioned.  No suggestions. ,1213880,-1,8033
"Yes, team has added the test case",1213722,-1,8043
written up is also a brilliant work!,1214238,-1,8033
No new test cases were added. The new code changes don't change the modify the existing code coverage. The modifications were mostly on UI. They could have added capybara testing.,1213015,1,8043
"As mentioned above, the team did a really good job at this. The writeup talks in detail what all tests did the team implement, and from the pull request, we can make out that the team was pretty consistent with their efforts. ",1214048,-1,8033
"Yes, it works as intended",1211575,-1,8033
"Unfortunately, I could not see any code written by the team for testing. However, the team has provided a description on how some of the edge cases have been handled. According to coveralls, the overall test has decreased by 0.01%. This could be one of the major topics for improvements with regards to this issue",1211993,-1,8043
"Tests have been thoroughly and very well performed. Also, well documented. ",1211726,-1,8043
"Most of them are good, but some edge cases should be considered.",1211647,1,8125
All is good. Only one code climate issue needs to be fixed before complete.,1214484,1,8125
No deployment provided so can't be verified.,1213159,1,8043
"There is only 1 issue stated in the Code climate regarding code refactoring. If that is done, this code can be merged.",1212801,1,8125
Yes the features work as described in the problem statement. The team has done good job and has fixed all the below issues:  Issue #971 Change create topic UI into AJAX.   Issue #926 We need a way to sort topics by topic number in assignment#edit page.   Issue #718 We should allow instructors to give feedback when accepting or rejecting topic suggestions. ,1211540,-1,8043
The code works as required.,1213391,-1,8043
"The given source code is ready for deployment. The object under test is fully covered and all of the test cases are implemented correctly. The build successfully passes Travis CI. The future team will have no problems in picking up from here. However, there is a room for further improvement when it comes to simplifying several test cases, especially the '.final_versions_from_reviewer' block. Moreover, 'xit' blocks need to be removed because the final version should not contain any tests that are in the pending state.",1212150,1,8125
The new features work as expected.,1212820,-1,8043
"As explained in the video, the build seems to work fine.",1213531,-1,8125
"Yes, it passed all the pull requests.",1214593,-1,8125
"The operation works perfectly from UI as shown in the youtube screencast. The App was not deployed anywhere (or the link was not posted), so couldnt test it by myself. Application could have been deployed during the second review for better understanding and trying out how the feature works.",1213016,1,8043
Not really. They did not pass.,1211643,1,8125
"Yes, passed Travis CI. Only one code climate issue",1214480,1,8125
"The working is perfect, everything works as intended. The team has explained this in a brief manner in their youtube video.",1211994,-1,8043
System works as expected and this is evidenced by tests and videos.,1211727,-1,8043
The most recent Travis build was run 2 days ago and the build log says that it has failed.,1212797,1,8125
The build successfully passes Travis CI.,1212146,-1,8125
The write-up is informative and provides all necessary details of the changes made.,1213160,-1,8043
"The test cases have covered all the scenarios that I can think of including the cases when the objects passed as parameters are nil. For example there are scenarios covering the cases when the objects like controller_action attribute, site_controller variable, content_page, menu items, parent id are nil objects; and also scenarios when URL of controller action is unavailable, when the by_name hash does not contain a given node name and when a menu id is not present in the @selected hash.",1212169,1,8033
"Yes, everything works. Well done!",1212603,-1,8033
All scenarios mentioned in the writeup are properly covered.,1212988,-1,8033
 They covered all the scenarios.  ,1213914,-1,8033
The function process seems to be a bit long. It could have been splitted based on oscillator types rather than having all of them in the same function. Apart from that rest of the code seems great.,1212334,1,8049
The write up is impressive and very detailed. It has been documented well which helps to understand about the project and the code implementation. It also provides detailed test plan which makes it easier for end user to do UI testing.,1211541,-1,8043
"The team has completed the missing code in the file oscillator_node.rs which generates different wave forms like sine, square, sawtooth and triangle. They then created the file oscillator.rs that generates objects and calls methods to run the different oscillator type examples. The code in both these Rust files have good comments that clearly explain what every snippet does and the significance of variables. This made it easy to follow the syntax and semantics of a new programming language like Rust (Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on memory safety and concurrency). The variable names used are intuitive and the code is well indented.  One issue that I can point out here is that the code is lengthy and complex with a lot of redundancy; especially those that define the audio context, destination node, oscillator and a few other local variables in the file oscillator.rs are repeated for every oscillator waveform and can certainly be encapsulated in one function that can be called only once in the file. ",1212550,1,8049
The code coverage of 100% satisfies the minimum criteria. It works as intended which can be seen in the video. The tests covers all the scenarios for passing them. ,1211868,-1,8033
The tests execute perfectly well and this has been demonstrated by the video. No suggestions.,1213879,-1,8033
cover all!,1214237,-1,8033
The writeup is well organized and well documented.,1213392,-1,8043
"The write-up is well written. It looks like they have improved the test plan sections, but still no automated tests in the repository.",1212821,1,8043
This team already had full coverage. I am not sure how to answer this question as new tests were not needed. ,1214166,-1,8033
"Yes, the team did added test cases, which have been clearly mentioned in the write-up. Although the results image isn't clearly visible, but it is still enough to figure out the team passed 100% of the test cases.",1214047,-1,8033
"Yes they have add some test cases, and the coverage increased.",1211574,-1,8033
The commits show equal contribution by all team members.,1213099,-1,8059
The team's project is unit testing the menu.rb model file. Hence they added Rspec test code in spec/models/menu_spec.rb. The pull request indicates that the overall coverage increased by a significant 5.5%. The report tells cites that 5779 lines have been covered and 13673 lines are relevant.,1212168,-1,8033
The function process seems to be a bit long. It could have been splitted based on oscillator types rather than having all of them in the same function. Apart from that rest of the code seems great.,1212334,1,8059
"Write up is good and self explanatory. Test plan helped a lot in understanding how to test it. As discussed in the earlier review, images could have been resized for better visibility. Was little difficult when one had to scroll along the page to view the entire image.",1213017,1,8043
Well written with understandable content,1212655,-1,8059
The code was very well-written and up to to servo standards.,1212844,-1,8059
"The writeup is well written with proper screenshots. I liked that the team has provided appropriate screenshots for specific scenarios which covers all the aspects of the project. However, the Test-plan section could be improved by adding the test code",1211995,1,8043
"The team has completed the missing code in the file oscillator_node.rs which generates different wave forms like sine, square, sawtooth and triangle.

Writeup is very detailed and well written. It is supplemented by enough code pieces and reasoning and good amount of pictures and videos to explain what the team has done in detail.,1211728,-1,8043
This code seems to be well structured and written,1212158,-1,8059

"Yes, It was committed and the changes were merged",1212845,-1,8059
Yes new code was added and committed during the 2nd round that implements oscillator node example to exercise different oscillator types and generate triangle waveform.,1212551,-1,8059
The code has passed the travis test and has addressed  all the issues of the Change Request. The code should be production ready after adding few more edge test case scenarios.  ,1211542,-1,8043

"The team's test plan includes running the oscillator binary file using the command ./oscillator. This will run the oscillator.rs where various oscillator nodes corresponding to sine, square, sawtooth and triangle waveforms are generated. Hence, the user will be able to listen to these waves after a definite interval.",1212553,-1,8059
It's working.,1212338,-1,8059
This project does not deal with UI,1212848,1,8059
"This project doesn't involve the UI. It focusses on audio processing by fixing the missing audio nodes in Servo's WebAudio standard. Precisely it generates the sine, square, sawtooth and triangle waveforms. The code that was modified and included from scratch works as intended. ",1212554,1,8059
"Overall, I think it could be deployed. There are no tests however written for this functionality, and there are some UI patterns that should be re-considered before deploying that do not match each other. When saving feedback, the ability to save feedback is automatically present and there is a button per row, while in the other location, you must first make a row ""editable"".",1212822,1,8043

Writeup is good and understandable. Test plan is written well indicating the steps clearly in what needs to be done to test.,1212339,-1,8059
"The team has checked most of the points given in the problem statement. However proper testing should be done before deploying this project on the main server. It must be ensured that the overall coverage increases. Other than the testing part, everything else has been implemented as expected.",1211996,1,8043
"The code is well written, tested and documented and hence I think it should be ready to be deployed. ",1211729,1,8043

"The writeup starts off by introducing Servo- Mozilla's experimental high performance browser engine and Rust- which is a systems programming language with memory safety and concurrency used to build Servo. It then moves over to Web Audio API for handling audio operations inside audio context and allow modular routing, and a workflow for implementing Web Audio was clearly listed. It then flows into the scope of the project and the implementation. The graphical and mathematical representation of the sine, square, sawtooth and triangle waveform gave a solid conceptual foundation. The code snippet of the changes done in oscillator_node.rs and the new file oscillator.rs (created by the team) has also been included. The section Build that explains the procedure to install dependencies (Rust), step by step procedure for building and running the build was very useful to explore the project. The team had included the build instructions for Windows and Debian-based Linux. They could have augmented the build instructions for Mac OS X, which might save Mac Users from reading verbose instructions on the official documentation and instead refer to a single source (the wiki).

well done! 100% cover. ,1214233,-1,8033
The writeup was really well explained.,1213104,-1,8049
The code is well written. No suggestions.,1213875,-1,8033
The code follows the Ruby style guide and makes good use of the Better specs documentation for writing Rspec test. The team has also made an extensive use of the describe and construct contexts which helps to understand the code written.,1211864,-1,8033
  They do not have these problems in the first round.            ,1213910,-1,8033
"Review 1 comments weren't addressed. Better name could have been used than ca_testx. Also scenarios test the code and not the behavior- instead of- ""when x happens, this method does this"" we have - ""x happens so y contains this"". This isn't maintainable as changes to implementation will break/stale out these tests.",1212984,1,8033
Overall well written code. Use of factory bot reduces code redundancy in building test cases. The team could have reduced the code redundancy inthe menu method test example.,1212599,1,8033
"The topic assigned to this team is Unit testing on menu.rb. So, they had to create Rspec tests for the methods in the model file menu.rb in the new file spec/models/menu_spec.rb. The team has precisely tested the functionalities of every method including all relevant scenarios (as contexts) of both the nested class Node and the enclosing class Menu. The names used for mock objects and literals are intuitive and follow the Ruby's convention. There were a few issues regarding incorrect indentation and the verbosity of the spec code in the previous round. The team has rectified those in this round. In my view, giving additional comments for code in rspec is superfluous as the tests are already embedded with information on what it intends to do through the use of 'describe', 'context' and 'it' methods.  The code is DRY through the use of reusable mock objects like menu, nodes, site controllers, content pages, controller actions, items and roles which span across the entire block where it is defined. Additionally, the use of before(:each) method to initialize and set up these objects further DRY's up the spec for the methods. ",1212165,1,8033

"YEs, the team has included the relevant test cases to test their changes and the overall coverage has increased by 0.04% which I think covers the scope of this project.",1213081,-1,8107
Coverage increased by 0.04%,1213053,-1,8107
Automated and manual tests have been added and coverage has increased by a very tiny amount.,1212644,-1,8107
Yes the team did add test cases that increased coverage. They are appropriate for the scope of the project.,1213829,-1,8107
Yes the team has added test for the UTF encoding acceptance. the coverage is not 100% and not tested with varied inputs but i believe would suffice for sanity check. Although the description of test in rspec file is ambiguous not clearly mentioning what exactly the test is expected to do. There is no test available for the issue 2 documented,1212861,-1,8107
Videos provided and the project is not deployed so cannot test from UI. But the issues are fixed and the system is working as expected. ,1212022,-1,8107
My testing shows things seem to be working as expected and documented.,1211435,-1,8107
The deployment link hasn't been provided. Though they have put videos for the same,1211533,-1,8107
It works as intended.,1212890,-1,8107
Yes code works.,1212260,-1,8107
"From the video links that have been shared, it is very clear that the features are working as they were supposed to. Even the test cases are passing. I see no issues with this part.",1213082,-1,8107
It was not deployed so couldn't check manually,1213054,1,8107
Looking from videos all the intended features work,1212645,-1,8107
Yes the code works has expected. it accepts the utf-8 codes now and also parses HTML tags in reviews like expected,1212862,-1,8107
The write-up is well written explaining all the steps undertaken to make desired changes and displaying how the system works after the changes have been made (with screenshots). They have also added Test plans in the wiki page,1212023,-1,8107
Pretty nicely written Wiki. Test Plan also describes how various tests were performed.,1211436,-1,8107
"It is well written, quite understandable. It clearly and adequately indicates the working functionality. I can understand what the project is about.",1211534,-1,8107
Write-up is little vague. Some are not explained properly.,1212891,1,8107
"Properly explained write up, with old and new changes.",1212261,-1,8107
The writeup I must say has been one of the best I have seen so far. It clearly mentions all the issues that they were facing and were asked to tackle. The solutions are well documented as well. The screenshots help in understanding the problems that they fixed.,1213083,-1,8107
"Yes the write up is good, if they were able to host it'd have been better for checking the work. ",1212646,-1,8107
"The write up is well written, elaborate, and clearly elucidates both the manual test cases considered as well as the automated tests implemented. Screenshots of both cases were also included as well. Steps for manual testing were clearly written.",1213831,-1,8107
The team has considerably improved the write-up. The write-up was very inefficient and dint provide details of the code-base also the video was encoded and impossible to view in Round 1. The team has rectified all these issues with round 2. they have documented their fixed more clearly with screen shots and code this time. ,1212863,-1,8107
"It can be deployed but first, it should be tested thoroughly. ",1212024,-1,8107
I think the changes are tested nicely and seem to cover all the necessary cases. This can be merged into the master branch and is ready for production use,1211437,-1,8107
"Watching the videos, I feel it is ready but no deployment link.",1211535,-1,8107
"As It did not pass the test, it is not ready. For a future team, end of this project should be a good starting place.",1212892,-1,8107
Its ready to be merged.,1212262,-1,8107
"In my opinion, this team has done pretty good work and the code looks like ready to be deployed on the production server.",1213084,-1,8107
"According to write up, it's good to go but since there is no deployed link I couldn't manually check.",1213056,-1,8107
"Yes, just fix the few issues present and that should be fine for it to be merged into main line as the feature seems to work and there isn't any major code issue.",1212647,-1,8107
"I believe this change that affects the system as a whole, needs more test to be performed in all affected tables and functions to be sure, no other part of the system is broken.My opinion is that, once all parts of the system test is done, corresponding to this centralized db change the code can be deployed to production.",1212864,-1,8107
Build did pass successfully. Could have written version specific code to avoid errors,1212020,-1,8107
Travis says some tests have failed. No conflicts though,1211433,1,8107
Pull request build passes well and there are issues.,1211531,-1,8107
"No, It did not pass travis ci and there are many conflicts that must be resolved.",1212888,-1,8107
Few minor issues with the build which can be ignored.,1212258,-1,8107
"The build has successfully passed the Travis CI test and there are no merge conflicts present in the pull request. However, there were a few code climate issues which I think can be easily fixed.",1213080,1,8107
"No, build pass did not pass Travis CI",1213052,1,8107
The travis ci test passes.,1212643,-1,8107
The build passed in Travis CI with no conflicts.,1213828,-1,8107
Not all changes has been verified successfully. few code climates rejects has happened as well. ,1212860,-1,8107
"The code is well-written, follows code standards. The naming conventions are followed. However, in some parts code is not formatted. ",1212606,1,8042
"The code was already delivered in the first round. Hence, no commits this round. The author has regularly pushed commits. ",1212607,-1,8042
"Travis test has failed, I can see it in pull request page. Conflict has not been resolved. ",1212608,1,8042
"Team has added many tests. Coverage has increased from 1 to 38%, which is impressive. ",1212609,-1,8042
"Yes, as mentioned in the problem statement, the solution is delivered. It works fine. ",1212610,-1,8042
"Documentation mentions the steps, problem statement, solutions and screenshots. The description are detailed. However, I feel there is no need to give screenshots for tests written. ",1212611,1,8042
"The last commits were 12 days earlier, hence no new commits were made during the second round.",1213862,-1,8042
"No, the Travis CI had failed. Yes, there were a few conflicts, like the lines of code was very large for a commit (>500), also there were a few pending test cases in the pull request.",1213863,1,8042
"Yes, the team did add test cases and the coverage increased too. But the team didn't put any efforts after the initial review round, since the failed tests are still failed, and there are no new commits since 12 days.",1213864,-1,8042
"Yes, the project did work as intended. The video demonstration and manual testing were enough to prove this fact.",1213865,-1,8042
"Yes, the code seems good to deploy if we consider the manual testing and the video demonstration. But since it didn't pass Travis CI, this claims seems a bit of a concern. If we ignore the fact that lines of code was >500, and thats why Travis CI failed, but still there are a few lingering issues which the Travis CI pointed, which still hasn't been fixed. It seems more of a patch, which would require more patches to patch in the future.",1213867,1,8042
"The write-up was very good, in the sense that it mentioned the high level view of the tasks first, and then dug deeper under the hood. But, it only showed what files they changed, and what it produced as a result. They could have also shown what is that they changed, or provided a link in the wiki. Yes, one can deduce that from the pull request too, but having a link or the content itself on the wiki is a big boon.",1213866,1,8042
The code is well written and well commented and follows ruby style guide.,1212970,-1,8042
No new commits. Last commit was on Nov 2nd before the first review.,1212971,1,8042
Travis CI build is failing. Lot of warnings and issues that have not been fixed. Many of them are trivial and easy to fix. ,1212972,1,8042
Overall coverage increased (+0.3%) to 37.074% Good work on including test cases. The app works fine after testing. The newly added tests cover the scope of this project very well.,1212973,1,8042
Very good guidance. Works as intended. This project is about enhancing Juniper bookmarks. The features work as they are supposed to. Automated RSpec tests were added. Could have described the automated tests in the wiki.,1212974,-1,8042
No issues codewise. Can add test cases and after thorough testing It can be deployed. Yes other team can take up and fix the minor issues and build pass.,1212976,-1,8042
"The write-up is very detailed with comparisons between previous and new versions, as to what features have been implemented but lacks on explaining how they are implemented. It can be improved by adding how the features have been implemented, why they chose this logic to implement the features.",1212975,-1,8042
They don't have code problem for the first round.,1211983,-1,8042
No new commit during second round.,1211984,-1,8042
"The build did not pass, their test failed. It seems that their grades_controller_spec.rb has some problems.",1211985,1,8042
"Yes, they add test cases, and the coverage is the same as the first round.",1211986,1,8042
"Yes, everything works.",1211987,-1,8042
"The writeup is great, in first round they did not have a test plan part. But they added it in the second part.",1211988,-1,8042
No new commits. ,1211794,-1,8042
"The code is well written, follows ruby guidelines and variables are aptly named. However, the changes are extensive and there are virtually no comments. The code can do with significantly more comments to explain what is being done.",1211793,1,8042
Build fails and there are aa plethora of issues (121 by code climate) and several warnings.,1211795,1,8042
The testing has been implemented and looks well implemented.,1211796,-1,8042
The functionality works and is evidenced by the video.,1211797,-1,8042
"The write-up is well written and looks through. The write-up details what has been accomplished and there are plenty of screenshots to support this. However, there is no mention of what code has been changed/added and why the authors chose this change.  Test plan has also been well written. The parts written are well written, but there's a good scope of improvement.",1211798,1,8042
"No. I do not think the code is ready to be deployed. I found the code change hard to understand, there are no comments and neither has the logic or rationale behind the new/changed code been given in the wiki. Besides, the build fails and there are a host of issues that need to be fixed.  Although all this might only be trivial issues and can be fixed rather easily, the code as of now, is not deployment-ready according to me. ",1211799,-1,8042
"Code looks okay, Suggestions for improvements not done.  build still fails   ",1214135,1,8042
Yes 1 checkin was done on nov 2nd   ,1214136,-1,8042
Build fails. pls check the same. There are no conflicts with the mail branch. ,1214137,1,8042
yes good number of tests added coverage increased a but but i would like to see more -ve tests. Mostly +ve test cases are covered in the tests    ,1214138,1,8042
yes ,1214139,-1,8042
"the Writeup misses out on elaborating the approach taken, it just lists the problem statement and jumps to test cases and fix. I would like to see more details on the approach taken.  The ""why"" is missing   ",1214140,1,8042
"build fails that needs to be investigated , once that is done i dont see why the project cannot be merged with the mail branch. Loot of good work has been done and merge with the main branch would bring the work to fruition.  ",1214141,1,8042
"The code quality is good however, it can be improved significantly. The code lacks proper comments and contains many if else statements. They could have been refactored and avoided.",1212242,1,8042
No new code was committed in the second round.,1212243,-1,8042
The build did not pass in Travis CI. There were no conflicts that needed to be resolved.,1212244,1,8042
The team has added test cases and they cover all the required functionality. The code coverage has increased by a small amount.,1212245,1,8042
The system works well. All the functionality has been implemented. I ran the project and it worked as intended. The back button issue in UI has been fixed.,1212246,1,8042
"The writeup needs significant improvement. ""No clear explanation is given as to which files are edited for which reason. Only file names are stated along with changes made. Why the changes were made and what do those changes correct is not given."" - This review was given by me last time,and no improvement has been made in this regard.",1212247,-1,8042
"This code will need to be refactored, however, we will not need to build it from scratch. Only some functionality has to be divided into chunks and moved into helper functions. The functionality works well.",1212248,1,8042
"Yes,coding practices seem upto standards",1212348,-1,8042
Doesn't seem to have new commits in round 2. last commit was on 2nd November,1212349,-1,8042
Travis CI did not pass. Code climate also has 121 issues to fix.,1212350,1,8042
The code seems to same as before. nothing new has been added.,1212351,1,8042
Seems to be working as intended. But all the features have not been implemented. The documentation mentions future work but no new code has been added.,1212352,-1,8042
"The solution of problem 1 was not clear from the write up, no explanation has been given.",1212353,1,8042
"No, all the features have not been implemented e.g 1. A reviewer can be recognized or credited if he added useful bookmarks i.e if the author has made use of the bookmark. 2. A function to add badges automatically if a participant had submitted more than threshold number of useful bookmarks. plus build did not pass as well",1212354,-1,8042
Overall the quality of code is great. There some variable which does not follow naming convection.,1212921,-1,8042
"Yes, they were made.",1212922,-1,8042
Yes there is one conflict that must be resolved to go ahead reported by TRAVIS CI.,1212923,-1,8042
They did add the test-cases but the coverage only increased by .3 %,1212924,-1,8042
"Yes, it works as intended.",1212925,-1,8042
The writeup is well written and self explanatory. ,1212926,-1,8042
"No, its not as the coverage is increases by small amount.",1212927,-1,8042
The overall structure of the code looks good and all the coding standards have been followed.,1213868,1,8042
No the new code was not committed during the second round. This could be due to the fact that the team finished their code at the end of the first round itself.,1213869,1,8042
"The code has been merged in a good way and there have been no merge conflicts. However, the Travis CI was failing and the code climate check was failing too. This is something that the team must look into and make sure that the changes that they have made are consistent with the existing expertiza code. ",1213870,1,8042
"Yes, the team did add test cases to test their changes and their overall test coverage has increased.",1213871,1,8042
Yes everything does seem to work properly. ,1213872,-1,8042
The writeup written well. The team could have included snippets of their code instead of screenshots.,1213873,1,8042
"Since the Travis test has failed, merging the code would not be a good idea. The project doesn't need to be redone from scratch, some modifications to the existing work could make the project ready for deployment.",1213874,-1,8042
There are a few issues regarding code repetition and extra white space (especially in the controller rspec file).,1212585,-1,8042
"No new code was added, nor was any necessary.",1212586,-1,8042
"The build isn't passing one of the added tests, but it looks to be a simple fix. ",1212587,1,8042
"Many test cases were added, with overall test coverage increasing for the project.",1212588,-1,8042
"It seems that everything works, though it was hard/confusing to find everything as per the instructions on the write-up.",1212589,-1,8042
"The write up is good, contains lots of pictures to show the added functionality. I found the test steps a bit confusing and it made validation hard.",1212590,1,8042
The code looks good.,1212591,-1,8042
"The code us good as mentioned in the previous rounds, except the lack of proper commenting. The authors did not improve the code from the previous rounds in this aspect.",1214156,1,8027
"The code is well written according to the video. Since there's no github submission, I went to the sumitter in the pull request to check his work. It seems that the code is relatively good. There's some minor indentation and alignment issue. And not much explaining comments. But other than that, no bad name, no long function.",1214598,1,8027
"very nice code, easy to read and understand.",1211948,-1,8027
"The code is difficult to understand. There are cases where factories are used and then later replaced by mocks in the individual test cases. The code also does not appear to be DRY, as several of the mocks appear redundant in the context of the plethora of factories built. ",1213854,1,8027
"For each method, there should be multiple test cases, but they put all tests for a method together wrap by a single it '.....' do, they should consider to add more it '......' do, to separate each test case, so the reader know what are they testing.",1214002,1,8027
The code written by the team satisfies the basic functionality expected. The team followed the comments from previous round of using good naming conventions for certain variables.,1212397,-1,8027
Travis build : passed.,1213220,-1,8027
"The Travis CI build passed for the test cases. Also, the code passed for Danger bot. However, there were some issues for the code climate that required to be resoled. Overall the pull request satisfies the required criteria. ",1212399,1,8027
The Travis CI has failed and also code climate.,1211823,1,8027
"Travis CI build passed, But Code Climate identified few issues",1213693,1,8027
the build passed in Travis CI. ,1214004,-1,8027
"Yes, the Travis CI is passed. No conflict that are remain do be resolved.",1214600,-1,8027
"Yes, the code did pass Travis CI successfully, but as mentioned earlier, the code did fail on 7 grounds, of low severity. This should have been fixed by the team, as the issues were very small, and required just minimal follow-up.",1214158,1,8027
Great job with your pull request and passing the Travis CI build. There are several code climate failures that could have been addressed many to deal with incorrect formatting and extra parenthesis or braces. Simple fixes so great job!,1214151,1,8027
It can be merged after fixing the code climate which has 7 issues(needs to follow the coding standards )and need to work upon the overall decreased code coverage.,1213224,1,8027
The team has presented a working deployment to be possible. It passes most of the builds and can be deployed on the production server. ,1212403,-1,8027
"As soon as they fix code climate issue, and separate each test cases with more it '......' do, it is good to deploy. ",1214008,1,8027
"It is very difficult to recommend merging this code. Although it builds and appears to function correctly, it is not properly documented. It is difficult to tell how the code works and whether test cases introduced actually function as they intend.",1213860,1,8027
The code is good because it covers the scenarios. But one thing that prevents the 5-star is that they do not have enough  commenting and seems to be not that detailed and careful in terms of the explanation.,1214604,1,8027
"Yes, apart from the 7 issues of minor severity from codeclimate, the code is perfectly well to integrate with the project. No, the project need not be planned and executed from scratch, it is implemented well enough.",1214162,-1,8027
Still missing the details.,1213223,1,8027
"The team has worked on improving the wiki document. The writeup now includes the Test plan section  that was suggested in the first round specifying the how the team setup an expertiza environment, the model functions used and the mock instance built for testing the model file. ",1212402,-1,8027
"The write-up is well written in my thought, it is clear and understandable. ",1214007,-1,8027
"The write-up is difficult to follow, and doesn't provide much insight into how the testing code works. Despite having a test plan section, no test plan is included.",1213859,1,8027
very nice writeup.,1211953,-1,8027
"The writeup is a bunch of codes, there's not enough explanation.  The ""allow"" function is important for the mock functions. But it is explained in no place.",1214603,1,8027
"This is where the project lacks the mos. The write-up isn't very informative, specially for an outsider. It states the points very shortly, without going into much depth. Also, the writeup bombards the user with lots of un-relevant information and pieces of code, which make it feel very long, although lacking significant content. The writeup could have been more detailed, and could have omitted the unnecessary parts, like dumping of code, and not explaining what it does. ",1214161,1,8027
The write up has some great information and snip its of code. It would have been a great addition to have included more discussion on the overall design of your test cases. Overall a nice wiki.,1214154,1,8027
"The system operation is verified and works as intended as demonstrated from the video. Also, all the test scenarios are covered.",1212401,-1,8027
"nil test were added, all scenarios are covered. ",1214006,-1,8027
The project successfully covered all the scenarios.,1214602,-1,8027
"Yes, the team covered all the scenarios I could have come up with. I specially appreciate the work that they've put into the import functionality. They have come with with more scenarios than I could have even thought of, and tested it pretty thoroughly. ",1214160,-1,8027
Build says the overall coverage decreased but the coverage of the  Test has increased.,1213221,-1,8027
"The team did not add any test cases since they had achieved a 100% coverage in the first round itself. However, certain changes made to the test cases included using proper naming conventions for attributes and following the DRY principle effectively throughout the model file.",1212400,-1,8027
"FRom the Pull request i see Coverage Decreased, But from the Screen-cast looks like 100% covered When i tried running manually i get the below errors  1) ReviewResponseMap #final_versions_from_reviewer     Failure/Error: prepare_final_review_versions(assignment, maps)          NoMethodError:       undefined method `prepare_final_review_versions' for #<Class:0x007fab83429010>",1213694,1,8027
They reached 100% at first round. ,1214005,-1,8027
Coverage was already at 100%.,1213857,-1,8027
100 percent coverage.,1211951,-1,8027
The coverage is 100% since the first round. It seems there's no newly added tests.,1214601,-1,8027
"Yes, the team covered 100% of the code they had to test. Also, the video given in the link was very informative and helped to understand the implications of the work done by the team to a far greater extent.",1214159,-1,8027
"Yes new commit is done for second review,",1213219,-1,8027
"The team did not attach the link for the github repo along with the other files submitted. This makes it difficult to comment upon the commits made. However, from the video link it can be seen that the test cases have improved to give a full path coverage.",1212398,1,8027
Involves fixing code climate issues. ,1211822,-1,8027
"They are trying to fix code climate issues, but there are still many failed, and no code change to improve readability. ",1214003,1,8027
"yes, new code committed during the 2nd round.",1211949,-1,8027
"There's no upload for the local folder. It seems that no new pull requests has been committed during the 2nd round, so I would guess no new code being committed for the 2nd round.",1214599,-1,8027
"Yes, the team made commits  days ago, but then it seems that they didn't follow-up with the feedback they received on the pull request, as their were 7 issues, though of minor severity, which required fixing, and then there were no commits after that.",1214157,1,8027
"yes, the authors have improved the code. the team has worked on the issue which I mentioned in the previous review. The code doesn't seems to be confusing now but it still needs proper commenting to be done. ",1213225,-1,8082
The function process seems to be a bit long. It could have been splitted based on oscillator types rather than having all of them in the same function. Apart from that rest of the code seems great.,1212313,1,8082
The code seems to be fine but due to lack of comments a little hard to understand. It would have been better if there were some comments in get_due_date_data and addQuestionnaireTableRow.,1214086,1,8082
There are lots of code climate issues to be fixed.,1212662,1,8082
"They haven't made any change since round 1 review. Haven't changed the naming as well eg topic_id1 doesn't seem right to me. But other than 1 or 2 names, everything else looks clean. Also you haven't added comments to you code. YOu should add comments when working in a open source project.",1212088,-1,8082
A few comments could be included in code to make it more clear.,1213127,-1,8082
"Suggested changes related to naming convention are not included in the 2nd round.  variable names : rop_topic_deadline1 , topic_id1 Puts statements are not removed : p topic_id1   Other than this the code is properly written following coding best practices.  ",1213468,-1,8082
The code is well written. I did not see any bad naming conventions or bad coding style.  ,1212508,-1,8082
there is only one commit made during the entire project. there is no new code added during the 2nd round.,1213226,-1,8082
There has been only one commit for the entire project.,1212775,-1,8082
Commits were made in second round ,1212314,-1,8082
No. There was a single commit throughout the project period and that was during the 1st round.,1214087,-1,8082
No commits were done in round 2.,1212663,-1,8082
Nothing changed since round 1. Haven't added a shorter video or a video with sound. Haven't made naming changes.,1212089,-1,8082
"No, the code was last committed on Oct 31st.",1213128,-1,8082
There were no new commits in the 2nd round.,1213469,-1,8082
I don't see any code changes after the first round.,1212509,-1,8082
"No, there are no test cases added by the team.",1213228,1,8082
No need for test cases. (+1 for mentioning it in the Wiki!),1212777,-1,8082
No test cases present but test plan covers it.,1212316,-1,8082
"No, the team did not add any test cases and the coverage did not increase. The overall decrease was -13.6% to 34.007%",1214089,-1,8082
No new tests were added and coverage has also reduced. Some UI testing could've been done.,1212665,-1,8082
They have mentioned that its UI change and has been discussed that testing isn't required in there documentation. But i think you should still have mentioned something there. Steps to follow to check how your changes work. ,1212091,-1,8082
Not required,1211455,-1,8082
Test cases were not required for this project.,1213130,-1,8082
The test cases were required as the chnages were related to UI. The team mentioned the same in the wiki.,1213471,-1,8082
"yes, the ui operations works as intended.the features fixed now works as intended.",1213229,-1,8082
It's working.,1212317,-1,8082
Since the project was deployed hence manual testing could not be done but the screenshots show that the project works as intended.,1214090,-1,8082
The feature works as per the video shown.,1212666,-1,8082
Fro video it seems to work as intended.,1212092,-1,8082
The link to the deployed application was not available. So testing could not be performed.,1213131,-1,8082
the video explains the new functionality and the functionality is working as expected. Good job!,1213472,-1,8082
"Yes, it works as expected.",1212512,-1,8082
the authors has worked on write-up.they have worked on the issue which I mentioned in the previous review. The code doesn't seems to be confusing now. the content on the page is in proper format earlier which was not. Test plan still need the team's attention. ,1213230,1,8082
Writeup has been improved after the first review. The codes now look more comprehensive.,1212779,-1,8082
Writeup is good and understandable. Test plan is written well indicating the steps clearly in what needs to be done to test.,1212318,-1,8082
"The write was good and well-written. However, it would have been better if some screenshots were also present in the writeup. May be juxtaposing the screenshots of 'before and after' of fixing the issues. That would have made the write-up easier to understand.",1214091,-1,8082
"The deployed link application again goes to video only, if deployment isn't done they could've removed the link.",1212667,-1,8082
Write up isn't good. They have just added there code in the write up without explaining anything. Plus no comments in code. Code snippets in writeup are going off the page.,1212093,-1,8082
"The writeup is good and clearly explains the issues faced. However instead of putting in the code changed, I feel it would be better to have screenshots of git commit history where we can see both the previous code and new code to get a good idea of what actually was changed.",1213132,-1,8082
The write-up is well written and organised. Everything looks fine. The team should have mentioned about the approach taken to solve the mentioned problem statement which will make the implementation easier to understand. Also the team could have included few screen shots in the write-up.  ,1213473,-1,8082
* Test plan is missing. * Code is directly copy-pasted in the approach section - pseudo code with proper comments would have been better. * Wiki alignment is missing in those places where the code is copy-pasted.  ,1212513,1,8082
"some improvements are required to deployed the code onto the production server. The code should included proper commenting so that if the future team picks up from this project, they could know what exactly the code is doing.",1213231,-1,8082
It might be good to move the long function to smaller functions. But the code looks clean and understandable.,1212319,-1,8082
"In my opinion, the project is ready to be deployed and does not need to adopt a different approach.",1214092,-1,8082
The feature seems ok but it can't be deployed yet with all pending issues.,1212668,-1,8082
"Writeup needs to be improved, video needs to have sound or make shorter videos. Build is failing, code climate has 56 issues. So no its not ready for deployment onto production. The way they have implemented is fine but they need to work on the said issue to make it production ready.",1212094,1,8082
Since the code coverage has decreased and the video demonstrates a proper working,1211458,-1,8082
"The deployed application was not available, so it cannot be accurately predicted if the code functions as intended. However the vedio links in the google drive show that the issues have been resolved through existing code. ",1213133,-1,8082
ll the checks are failing currently. The changes have a lot of robocop issues as well which should be fixed. Also the CI build is failing at the moment. Some of the tests are failing because of the change. ,1213474,-1,8082
"Code looks fine, but build issue has to be fixed.",1212514,-1,8082
"the build is still failing and there are issues which needs the team's attention. there is one warning and 1 error which needs to be fixed by the issue. according to the error, team should remove the debug code from the pull request.",1213227,-1,8082
"Travis CI build is not passed. Though this was a bit common even for the second review, the 'codeclimate' issues are still showing.",1212776,-1,8082
"No, the build did not pass in Travis CI. Several checks had failed but there was no conflict.",1214088,-1,8082
"None of the tests - travis ci, code climate have passed",1212664,-1,8082
Everything is failing. Code climate has 56 issues. Build is failing. Haven't made a change since round 1.,1212090,-1,8082
The Travis test has failed and overall coverage has also decreased. There were many errors in the build log of travis.,1213129,-1,8082
All the checks including the CI build is failing.,1213470,-1,8082
Build is failing in Travis CI,1212510,-1,8082
"The code looks good with the standards followed. The changes are explained in the wiki for the same. Also, the video has been uploaded but doesnt seem to have the audio with it.",1213529,1,8088
"The code is written very well. There's some minor issues (sometimes there's duplicate ""allow""s. But actually in the same ""describe""  just one ""allow is enough. On the other hand, there's no bad name, no hard-to-understand functions. Comments can be added just a little bit more to help people understand. Some comments are not supposed to be there (such as discarded codes)",1214591,1,8088
The code is perfect right now.,1211934,-1,8088
"Yes, through their commit record, I have seen some improvement.",1211641,-1,8088
Well written code.,1214478,-1,8088
"Yes, they have improved after the last review",1213787,0,8088
The source code is mostly written in a coherent way and is straightforward to follow.  The 'context' blocks are extensively used which increases the project documentation. The commented chunks of code blocks that were present in the 1st round are mostly removed. There are still a few instances left and I would suggest to remove them because they reduce the overall readability. I would also suggest to decompose the 'it' block inside the '.final_versions_from_reviewer' by moving the common setup to a before(:each) block and spreading the assertions across several 'it' statements.  Another improvement would be to remove the 'xit' code blocks because they only increase the clutter and do not add any value to the code. Adding one comment explaining why the blocks are no longer necessary would do the job.,1212144,1,8088
"I dont seem many commits for round 2, but yes the video has been added for explanation. Also, the wiki is pretty well explained with the code.",1213530,1,8088
"Yes, there's new commits.",1214592,-1,8088
"yes, new code committed during the second round.",1211935,-1,8088
"Yes, according to the commit record, they have commit new code during the 2nd round.",1211642,-1,8088
Yes,1213788,-1,8088
"The number of commits that are made after the 1st round is impressive. The team has made a significant progress during the 2nd round, however I would suggest using more descriptive names for the commits so that it becomes easier for the reader to refer to them in the future.",1212145,1,8088
The command to run the test cases is given in the wiki. Better thing would have been to provide the screenshots of the test cases and git links to the code to make the wiki more concise and well explained.,1213532,1,8088
The second commit is perfect. it got perfect coverage. But it seems that the 100% coverage was so since the first round. But the new commited code as better code style and no more indentation issue,1214594,-1,8088
100 percent coverage.,1211937,-1,8088
"Yes, they have added some test cases, and coverage increased.",1211644,-1,8088
100 % coverage achieved. Great work!,1214481,-1,8088
The test coverage on the diff in this pull request is 100.0% (50% is the threshold). This pull request will bring the total coverage in the repository to 28.7% (-19.0% change). ---- seems like the coverage was reduced. Need to add some test cases to increase the coverage. The above reason is why I have given 4. But I would definitely consider this as well ----   Overall coverage increased (+11.0%) to 47.72% ,1212798,1,8088
The team did a great job in increasing the test coverage to 100%.,1212147,-1,8088
The features work as per the given instructions. Though there seems to be more scope for extra test cases.,1213533,1,8088
This is a testing project. The tests have covered all the scenarios possible.,1214595,-1,8088
"Yes, it works as intended. ",1211645,-1,8088
The code coverage is 100%. Every test case passes after a manual check.,1212148,-1,8088
"The write up has a lot of code in it, which does not show up what are the changes exactly made. It would have been better to put the links to the git files where the code changes are made for good comparisons. Also, with this the wiki size would have reduce.",1213534,1,8088
"The writeup has  covered nearly everything we need. all the function details are in the writeup, as welll as each function. However, I think there's too much code and not enough textual explanation.",1214596,1,8088
great writeup.,1211939,-1,8088
"Some parts of the writeup are not includeed, such as test plan. ",1211646,1,8088
More details about the test cases can be given in the write up for a better understanding.,1214483,1,8088
The document is well written with all the required details.,1212800,-1,8088
Still a lot of code on the writeup page.,1213792,1,8088
"The team has improved the writeup since the 1st round. The 1st round version consisted of the copied code from review_response_map.rb and review_response_map_spec.rb files. This version clearly defines each test case and in some instances elaborates on the inner workings of the blocks for example "".import"" Method discussion. However, design principles and patterns that were used in this project are still missing from the writeup.  One thing that stands out in the code is that every mock object is defined at the start of the file. The team could provide a rationale for this decision and why it is superior to for example using different mocks for each separate test suite.",1212149,1,8088
"The code seems good enough to proceed, but with few more test runs as I can see alot of code added.",1213535,1,8088
"Yes, for production code itself is perfect.",1214597,-1,8088
"Most of them are good, but some edge cases should be considered.",1211647,1,8088
All is good. Only one code climate issue needs to be fixed before complete.,1214484,1,8088
"There is only 1 issue stated in the Code climate regarding code refactoring. If that is done, this code can be merged.",1212801,1,8088
"The given source code is ready for deployment. The object under test is fully covered and all of the test cases are implemented correctly. The build successfully passes Travis CI. The future team will have no problems in picking up from here. However, there is a room for further improvement when it comes to simplifying several test cases, especially the '.final_versions_from_reviewer' block. Moreover, 'xit' blocks need to be removed because the final version should not contain any tests that are in the pending state.",1212150,1,8088
"As explained in the video, the build seems to work fine.",1213531,-1,8088
"Yes, it passed all the pull requests.",1214593,-1,8088
Not really. They did not pass.,1211643,1,8088
"Yes, passed Travis CI. Only one code climate issue",1214480,1,8088
The most recent Travis build was run 2 days ago and the build log says that it has failed.,1212797,1,8088
The build successfully passes Travis CI.,1212146,-1,8088
"The code has almost no comments. I found some lint, particularly some commented-out blocks of code. ",1214037,1,8018
"Code looks good apart from a lot of commented code. If that is written by the team and was not already present, then it should be removed if not used before submitting pull requests.",1212802,1,8018
"In the first round the team had only created the two Web IDL  files namely OffScreenCanvas.webidl and OffScreenCanvasRenderingContext2D.webidl; which are the interface files which define the implementation in the corresponding files offscreencanvas.rs and offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs. In this round the team has implemented the functionalities described in the two Web IDL files in offscreencanvas.rs and offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs. The offscreencanvas.rs interacts with the javascript and hence has the constructor with attributes height and width; a method getContext() to return the reference to OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2d; and a reflector object for garbage collection. The offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs file does not interact directly with Javascript and does not have a constructor or reflector object. It has the code to build the offscreencanvas object.  On inspection, the variable and method names used in the code are intuitive. But the main issue is that the name of the webidl file OffScreenCanvasRenderingContext2D.webidl and corresponding Rust file offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs don't match. The team could have formatted the code appropriately for readable indentation. There are not many comments that give a high level description of the code. Instead there are some instances of unnecessary code that has been commented. The code is indeed DRY.",1212179,1,8018
"The code seems to be good. It follows the principle of good design. Even though I do not know RUST, the use of variable names was very intuitive.",1213211,-1,8018
"The code is very well written, there are no bad names or long and complicated functions. However, there are no proper comments that have been provided for the viewers understanding. One suggestion would be to include some comments for better understanding.",1212109,1,8018
"The code doesn't make sense to me, someone who isn't familiar with this project, but it does seem to be formatted well.",1212207,-1,8018
New code was committed but all at once on the same day.,1212803,1,8018
Some commits were made to rectify old errors and get an approved pull request,1212356,-1,8018
"Yes, there is ",1214276,-1,8018
"Yes, new code has been committed in the 2nd round. The team has essentially implemented the offscreencanvas.rs and offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs. offscreencanvas.rs is respondible for implementing the OffscreenCanvas.webidl. This interacts directly with javascript and when a new instance of offscreencanvas is created, it calls the constructor with arguments height and width which in turn calls the new method defined in this file. It also contains the reflector object that tells the Javascript garbage collector to ignore the canvas object while clearing memory. Additionally, it has the implementation of the getContext() method that returns a weak reference to OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2d, which is responsible for doing background rendering task. offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs has the implementation of OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2D. It does not interact directly with JavaScript, so it does not have the Constructor or reflector. The functionality to build an offscreencanvas object has been implemented in this file.  ",1212180,1,8018
Yes there new commits in round 2.,1213212,-1,8018
"There are commits on a single day, that is yesterday. One suggestion would be to commit regular progress on the git. ",1212110,1,8018
Several new commits were added during the second round.,1212208,-1,8018
The tests were mentioned in the report but not in the pull request. There was also no coverage information. The approach looks good though.,1214040,1,8018
Test cases are yet to be added,1212358,1,8018
The team has suggested 2 methods to test. The first and the recommended method is using the existing automated tests for OffScreenCanvas feature. A new offscreen-canvas directory was added to tests and a new .ini file enables the new preference. The second approach is writing own test cases and a sample HTML file can be used to test if the OffscreenCanvas is rendered.,1212182,1,8018
No test cases as this wasn't a testing project.,1213214,1,8018
"In the test plan section and on Git also I found no test cases written. There is testing done, however it is not what was desired.",1212112,1,8018
"I don't see any tests added by this team, although they do mention that their code additions were not particularly testable except with the existing automatic tests, which they enabled.",1212210,-1,8018
Still did not pass the Travis CI,1214277,1,8018
This is not an Expertiza project.,1212111,-1,8018
Everything in the pull request failed (although this is not an expertiza project),1212209,1,8018
The build fails so this project will not work in its current state. There were instructions however on how to set up the project and show that it is working.,1214041,1,8018
Some parts of the code are still left to be implemented,1212359,1,8018
To test the system operation the project has to be built and run. The Sample HTML file was used to render a Test Canvas as given in the Wiki,1212183,-1,8018
No link was given to the demo of the project.,1213215,1,8018
When tested the project does what was desired to be done.,1212113,-1,8018
This system doesn't have a UI I can view as it seems to be a browser add on.,1212211,-1,8018
"The authors made a solid attempt at improving the writeup. However, there are still some issues. DOM was left undefined and the code was separated from the descriptions.",1214042,1,8018
"Write up is good, with code flow diagram and test plan (pull request).",1212807,-1,8018
The wiki is quite comprehensive and gives the build steps clearly. It could also include a more basic explanation in layman terms about what the OffScreenCanvas API does,1212360,1,8018
The Wiki is pretty much strong with plenty of info.,1214280,-1,8018
"The write-up is lucid and has now incorporated the changes that were made in the round 2. It starts off by introducing Servo, Rust, OffScreenCanvas, web worker, Web IDL. The authors then describe the code flow using a flow chart which was really appealing. I especially liked the Under the hood section, which elucidated the files (OffscreenCanvas.webidl, OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2D.webidl, offscreencanvas.rs and offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs) that they modified/created in this project and their functionalities concisely. The write up then includes the code from the above four files and finally ends with the test plan with 2 approaches, links to pull request and references.",1212184,-1,8018
The write-up is good. I liked the use of the flow-chart to explain the flow of their code and explain the functionality. I think that this was the first write-up that used a flowchart.,1213216,-1,8018
The writeup is the best part about the project. It describes clearly what and how the work is done. One can clearly understand their working strategy from the writeup.,1212114,-1,8018
I'm unable to get a really good idea of exactly what was done here for this project other than that it can be used as a display and rendering port and that it improves fail-safeness of browsers.,1212212,-1,8018
"The build is failing, but it seems the team has it working locally. I think they can get it working with this approach.",1214043,1,8018
"Pull request failed the tests, so that must be fixed before merging.",1212808,1,8018
"As suggested by the Mozilla team themselves, a few errors need to be rectified. The final code also needs to be formatted using rustfmt to make it consistent with the design",1212361,1,8018
Did not even pass the auto test.,1214281,1,8018
"There can be a few changes incorporated to the code- especially the name mismatch of the web IDL and corresponding Rust file needs to be fixed. The unnecessary comments have to be removed. Moreover, the pull request shows that there are a few changes that have been requested and all checks have failed. So, the code can be merged and deployed only after these are incorporated. ",1212185,1,8018
I think that they need to fix some things that are mentioned by travis CI. Once they do that they are good to go.,1213217,1,8018
The code is almost completed. Only a few final touches will make it ready to be deployed onto the production server. Maybe the future team can also work on it to achieve some more enhanced features.,1212115,1,8018
"I don't think this project is the type that would be deployed on a production server, and I can't say it's ready to be added because every thing in the pull failed on github.",1212213,1,8018
"The code has been written as per the coding standard. The code written by the team adheres to dry principle. However, as per my first review comments it is advisable to follow better naming conventions. The team could rename their function names such as the below one to something smaller such as get_time_diff. The code needs refactoring in names and addition of comments.   def get_time_diff_btw_due_date_and_now(due_date)",1214361,1,8084
The team has not made any new commits in round 2 because they did the code implementation in round 1.,1214362,1,8084
The write up addresses details of all the three problem statements along with the code changes done in every file and the files added. The team has also added screenshots of the manual testing.,1214366,1,8084
"The code implementation is correct , so with more edge test cases and after resolving the warnings in the travis test, the code would be production ready.",1214367,-1,8084
I still see some lint issues and commented-out code. The code looked fairly DRY and compliant with standard Ruby style and looks that way still.,1214079,1,8087
drying is possible,1212151,1,8087
The code that is written has long functions. Few names do not really provide the gist of what the function is intending to perform,1212025,1,8087
The code is well modularized and appropriate names are used for methods.  ,1213190,-1,8087
The git link to the code repository is not provided.,1212592,1,8087
The code is very well written and comments are properly given. Also the variables are descriptive and ruby guidelines are followed.,1212956,-1,8087
"The code was well written and looks dry. However, a few comments could be added to make the code more understandable. ",1212872,1,8087
First review comment weren't addressed.,1212991,-1,8087
"Code looks okay, changes suggested have not been implemented. I wanted to see more comments on ""why"" this is has been done, which is missing.  Also strings checks for str != '' are still used and not .empty  ",1214093,1,8087
new code was comitted.,1212152,-1,8087
Few commits can be seen during 2nd phase. Mostly are for test plans.,1212026,-1,8087
yes new commits were added during the second round.,1213191,-1,8087
I don't see new code being committed.,1212593,1,8087
No. The last commit was on oct 21st.,1212957,-1,8087
The code was committed frequently during the second round. ,1212873,-1,8087
Yes lot of code has been checked in most oct 31. Good work ,1214094,-1,8087
"The team added many tests. They seem like they would have high coverage, but, with the failing build, this cannot be confirmed easily.",1214082,-1,8087
sufficient test cases added.  ,1212154,-1,8087
Lots of test plans are added. The coverage decreased for the plans added. The test plan covers the basic functionality and not the edge cases,1212028,1,8087
1) Yes. The team has added test cases. The newly added tests are not covering the range of this project well. The total coverage has decreased and more number of files have lost coverage.  2) Overall coverage decreased (-28.6%) to 8.18%.       ,1213193,1,8087
Didn't see any test cases.,1212595,1,8087
Overall coverage decreased (-28.6%) to 8.18%. The team did not add test cases that covers the scope of this project. Could have thoroughly tested with test cases. Also could have worked upon increasing test coverage.,1212959,1,8087
"The overall test has coverage decreased. However, the RSpec tests added to the project seem appropriate. ",1212875,1,8087
Not able to get coverage from the log: https://coveralls.io/jobs/41685719,1212994,-1,8087
"Yes the team did add test cases but I am surprised on why the coverage numbers have fallen so much. This needs some investigation.  I think good test cases were added as part of the work, i would have though liked to see more -ve test cases checking for the failure conditions ",1214096,1,8087
"Without a video or instructions, I cannot easily verify that the solution works since there was an error thrown when I tried to follow the recipe. The error occurred while I was trying to request an account. More detailed testing recipes would help. Getting the accounts and their email addresses set up in the deployment is the main difficulty.",1214083,1,8087
ui works as intended.,1212155,-1,8087
The basic functionalities are working as mentioned in the write-up. Refactoring the code would hamper a few functionalities as there are multiple instances where a single function is performing different actions,1212029,1,8087
Checked the following functionalities through UI:1) Log in as instructor. - checked2) Got to profile page. - checked3) Check the box that says 'Send me copies of all the emails'. -checked4) Log in as 'student2064' with password 'password'. - checked 5) Trigger any action that may result in mail being sent to the student. -checked6) Log in to instructor's email to check if copy of the same email has been received. --could not check if emails are being sent/received . 1) Login as a student and send an invitation to an invitee. -checked2. The invitee should get an mail on your invitation. - could not check mailing 3. Login as the invitee and accept/decline the invitation. - checked4. The inviter should get a mail on the response. - could not check  the mailing ,1213194,1,8087
"The project is about improving email notifications. Yes, it works as intended. Screenshots of the code and changes made have been clearly described. The tests cover all the scenarios.   ",1212960,-1,8087
The features work as intended and the emails are sent to the concerned party.,1212876,-1,8087
"Was unable to test the work from UI , but the implementation looks okay. I would have liked some screen hots of mails and videos to be uploaded as references so that reviewers could look at them as well.   ",1214097,1,8087
"The team added the test plan section but it was too short and did not explain all the test files created and/or modified. The implementation section could do without the many code dumps. Otherwise, the writeup was concise and effective.",1214084,1,8087
writeup covers all the specifications and descriptions but is too lengthy.,1212156,1,8087
The write-up is well explained along with the test plans explained in steps to make it easy for testing but that just have a few cases with cover basic functionalities,1212030,1,8087
1) The write-up is comprehensive and clearly explained. 2) Should explain the test cases in more detail.,1213195,1,8087
"The write-up is very detailed as to what features have been implemented but lacks on explaining how they are implemented. It can be improved by adding how the features have been implemented, why they chose this logic to implement the features.",1212961,1,8087
The write-up is good and it clearly explains what each portion of the changed code is intended for.,1212877,-1,8087
Writeup is decent. I felt that code should have been quoted rather than included pictures of as that would make it easier to modify. The pngs weren't same size which appears to be negative that people  have commented on my work too.,1212996,1,8087
"Write up is Okay, The test plan comes before solution / approach section . pls change the ordering. there is no reference section  instead of putting screen shots of code it would be better if the authors had put code snippets  ",1214098,1,8087
"It looks like the code is almost ready, but there are simply some failing tests to get past.",1214085,1,8087
it is good starting place for future team to pickup.,1212157,-1,8087
A few changes to functions and their declaration have to be made to make the code production ready,1212031,1,8087
"1) Yes, just could not check the mailing functionality. 2) Also the test coverage needs to be improved.",1213196,1,8087
"No this code is not ready to be deployed onto the production server. Minor bugs said by the Travis CI can be fixed. Also, Add test cases and after thorough testing, it should be good to be deployed and hence this will be a good starting place for a future team to pick up.",1212962,1,8087
"The code is ready to be deployed onto the production server and in fact, the project was even partially merged.",1212878,-1,8087
Spec needs to be fixed before merge.,1212997,1,8087
No the build failure needs to be investigated. Some refactoring regarding the messaging should be done. instead of hard coding the mail it should be read from a config file. ,1214099,1,8087
The build does not pass. It looks like some failing new tests are the issue.,1214081,1,8087
build not pass in travis ci.,1212153,1,8087
Not it didnt pass the test. ,1212027,1,8087
The Travis builds have failed but there are no conflicts to be resolved. ,1213192,1,8087
The build did not pass in Travis CI. There was one failure which needs to be fixed.,1212874,1,8087
"Build failing due to bad test. Log shows one error for now. Also, I have a feeling tests on some projects aren't able to run all test- the coverage log for this PR shows that none of the files are getting covered: https://coveralls.io/jobs/41685719",1212993,1,8087
No Build still fails in spite of asking them to fix the build issues in first place,1214095,1,8087
Build did not pass Travis CI but there are a lot of warnings and issues that have not been fixed. Many of them are trivial and easy to fix. ,1212958,1,8087
"The code is visually stunning. I am a great fan of the readibility. There are some instances of redundancy in the #controller_action / #site controller tests. Also in the #get_item/#get_menu. Would be easy to pull those out into a begin block. Otherwise, very lovely.",1213325,1,8046
"Currently your team have 4 code climate issues that denote code redundancy as stated in the code comment above. Best just to bring those statements out to keep it as dry as possible. From what I can tell, none of the pull requests pass these requirements including my own teams so I am not sure what is the cause of this but I guess no one will be getting all the stars on this questions :)",1213327,1,8046
No new test cases were added from the previous submit. Test cases already had full coverage so there was no need for additional testing. I was unsure how to answer this question as the rubric says any new test cases added.,1213328,-1,8046
The write up is good overall. I believe there could be more explanation or discussion into test cases not included in the design but otherwise a good wiki.,1213330,1,8046
"All code is good, a variable name was even improved during the second round.",1212536,-1,8046
"A small change was made, but there wasn't a need for drastic additions. ",1212537,-1,8046
All necessary code is passing the build.,1212538,-1,8046
The video makes it clear that the tests work and are covering all aspects necessary. ,1212540,-1,8046
The write up is still good.,1212541,-1,8046
The code is quite good.,1212542,-1,8046
"The coverage was already at 100%, but they did update it to pass the build.",1213797,-1,8046
"The test plan should have come before the implementation details. I gave this suggestion in my previous review as well. Still, the documentation is well written overall. It's just a puzzling choice to put the test plan near the end.",1213799,1,8046
"I had suggested changing the ambiguous or bad variable like temp, temp1. These changes have been incorporated. However comments missing. Adding these will improve the readability of the code and make it easy to refactor at a later stage as per requirements",1212200,1,8046
Yes. Variable name changes suggestion was incorporated.,1212201,-1,8046
Travis tests have failed. No conflicts. The overall test coverage has improved.,1212202,-1,8046
It is a testing project. The overall test coverage has improved. The tests thoroughly test the menu-bar and the sub-tress of menu bar(sub-menu options) as per the requirements.,1212203,-1,8046
No UI or functional changes are applicable. All the 29 tests run successfully,1212204,-1,8046
It is very well documented. No changes were required even during the first review.,1212205,-1,8046
"It improves the test coverage, So once the Travis tests pass, It is ready to be merged with the Master branch. However no production deployment is applicable for test coverage improvement.",1212206,-1,8046
nicely written test cases,1212620,-1,8046
Did not pass Travis CI,1212622,-1,8046
Not deployed,1212624,-1,8046
There is one new commit in round 2.,1211621,-1,8046
I'm afraid that the build failed and there are code climate issues.,1211622,1,8046
Yes the coverage is 100% already.,1211624,-1,8046
"The wirteup is pretty good. It gives the test plan and all the test cases. Also, there is explanation of the test process and logic. Just one minor problem.  The 29 tests provide 100% coverage of the lines in menu.rb. Before the project the coverage was only It is an incomplete sentence.",1211625,1,8046
The code written follows the ruby on rails best practices. ,1213332,-1,8046
"Yes, the team has made one commit during the second round. They updated an ambiguous variable name.",1213333,-1,8046
"No, the pull request didn't pass the Travis CI build, but it doesn't have any conflicts with the base branch. ",1213334,-1,8046
"Yes, the team has added plenty of tests. The test coverage increased to 100% whereas the overall coverage has increased by 11.4% ",1213335,-1,8046
"Yes, the test covers all the scenarios, including testing values of variables in the menu node and null case scenarios.",1213336,-1,8046
"The introduction to the scope of the project has been written neatly, but I feel the test plan should have been a little more elaborative, a short description of the tests would be nice to have.",1213337,1,8046
"While the test coverage has increased to 100%, the team has made some changes to ""schema.rb"" file, this might cause a problem on other dependent modules. Hence, I feel it is risky to deploy it on production. The project doesn't need to be started from scratch by the next team. ",1213338,1,8046
"The team has corrected a single bad name used in the tests. There has been no change done to DRY the code yet. there test as mentioned earlier has few segments repeated throughout each test. For ex, the instantiation of Menu object. There has been no comments added for the code yet.",1212746,-1,8046
"Yes, there has been one commit in round 2, rectifying the bad name used",1212747,-1,8046
"There has been few code climate issues reported, but few of travis tests has failed. mot all changes has been verified successfully",1212748,1,8046
"Yes the project is a test project for menu.rb. The code coverage has increased to 100%. Though the code covers all lines, i feel edge cases are not covered well. ",1212749,1,8046
Yes the coverage is good but the test scenarios are fairly straightforward and no elegant stubs or mocks used. The code isnt DRY ,1212750,1,8046
"No significant improvements to the write up. It still doesnt explain clearly the functionality of menu.rb and the need for different tests. There is code provided in the write-up, which is more reductant than informative. No future scope or enhancements documented. They have provided all necessary links and coverage data.",1212751,1,8046
"As its a test project, deployment to production may not be applicable. The code can be merged, but i would suggest few changes to DRY the code as the test seems slow, which is a scope for improvement.",1212752,1,8046
I don't see tests for the logout button on the menu.,1212617,1,8046
"The code written is following the Ruby on rails guidelines. The variables, methods, and class names do seem to follow proper convention and are suggestive of the functionality they are being used for. In some cases they could have used a little more descriptive names for variables for example inside app/helpers/student_task_helper.rb  they could have used background_colour instead of rtn as a variable name in the due_date_color() method. It will become more readable for the reviewers to understand the functionalities. Also they have added to few commits for the amount of code change that they have done. The commit messages  are not descriptive enough about what changes have the authors committed. ",1214030,1,8066
"Code Snippet added.  Still, Git link is not of the pull request.   No link provided for the change. Either screencast or the URL of the deployed application would have been ideal.",1211772,1,8066
"there is no code included in the write-up,but the team had mentioned the changed files in the write.As a reviewer, it is difficult to find out which code has been added by the team. The team should clearly explain what they are doing.",1213429,1,8066
"The code is well written, the way the list function was split into multiple modular functions is appreciable. A great amount of effort has gone into fixing the issues.",1213952,-1,8066
New code added is written well with DRY and no long or complicated functions. I could see file updated has changes on line such as tab and space. Team could work upon indentation. ,1211927,-1,8066
The code is well written. No issues with naming conventions or coding style.,1212564,-1,8066
The code is very well written and comments are properly given. Also the variables are descriptive and ruby guidelines are followed.,1211606,-1,8066
The code is clean.,1211627,-1,8066
overall only 3 commits are made during the entire project. no new code was committed during the second round,1213430,-1,8066
The last commit is on 10/31.,1211628,-1,8066
"There have been only two commits - one on 30th Oct and second on 31st October. There have been no commits since. It would have been better if you people had given one more commit resolving the issues given by code climate, since most of them are trivial. ",1211607,1,8066
No new commits in the second round.,1212565,-1,8066
No new commit has been added since the last submission. The commit messages are not descriptive. They should commit small portions of code one by one with proper description of the changes in the commit  message. Also their functions seem to be very long. they may consider refactoring and creating more cohesive code. Each function should do only one task.,1214031,1,8066
No New commits.,1211773,-1,8066
Could not see any new commits after last change. Also commits distribution is not equal.,1211928,-1,8066
No changes were committed in round 2.,1213953,-1,8066
Yes.,1211630,-1,8066
"It is given in wiki that most of your test cases depend on checking the output. However, like I mentioned in my last review, several test cases like the ones mentioned below can be automated. This is especially true as TDD is explicitly mentioned in your problem statement: ""Write the required tests before implementing/refactoring the methods in the above-mentioned classes"".  Add past due assignments to the students task list (on Student View). Check for correction in due dates of assignments (when an assignments due date is edited, it should be appropriately moved from the Past assignments list to the Current Assignments list if needed) On Student Task page, separate the list of 'teamed with' students from the current tasks box. ",1211609,1,8066
No new test cases are written.,1212567,-1,8066
Test Plan could be described better.,1211775,-1,8066
Team could have added test plan in wiki along with test covered and test description. Also could have worked upon increasing test coverage.,1211930,-1,8066
Test are written ,1212945,-1,8066
The team has added testcases but lacks coverage. The overall coverage decreased by 10.6% to 37.063%.,1213955,-1,8066
No test cases are added by the team and overall coverage of the project is decreased by 10.6%.,1213432,-1,8066
The operations work as intended but need to have automated test cases.,1211610,-1,8066
The bug fixing does work according to the screenshots provided by the authors. They have provided a step by step screenshot of the issue that they have fixed. The authors haven't hosted their version of the expertiza so it is very difficult to actually check the functionality. They could have hosted expertiza on VCL or they could have put a screen cast of the working functionality to help in reviewing.,1214034,1,8066
No Screencast or deployed URL provided.,1211776,1,8066
I can not see any link to test changes as well as no video to watch the changes. Team could have shared implemented part to test and review.,1211931,1,8066
"I could not get a deployment link or watch a video that demonstrates the work done. So, I'm unable to test.",1212946,-1,8066
I could neither test it manually nor there were any videos to check the functionality.,1213956,-1,8066
Write-up needs serious attention of the team. The approach followed is good but it still needs to be worked on. the write-up should include contents which makes it self-explanatory.,1213434,1,8066
"lacking necessary UI description, eg, the final appearance of the task list or the pathway to show a task list.",1211819,1,8066
"The write-up is very detailed as to what features have been implemented but lacks on explaining how they are implemented. It can be improved by adding how the features have been implemented, why they chose this logic to implement the features and how to test the code or show how they have tested the code.",1211611,1,8066
The wiki documentation has been updated. All the information has been documented in a neat and logical manner. The write up adequately provides what functionality the work is related to. They havent updated any part of the wiki documentation but overall their documentation is concise and to the point.,1214035,1,8066
Write-up is explained pretty well.,1211777,-1,8066
Write up is too brief. No detail description of approach taken as well as no picture to relate to changes as suggested to add in last review.  ,1211932,1,8066
"- The write-up does mention the files changed but misses out on adding code snippets. - Little formatting inconsistencies found like ""-- Expertiza Project"" in the introduction, and a "":-"" only for Overview but none of the other headings. - Looks like ""Separate the list of 'teamed with' students from the current tasks box"" needs to be a heading rather than plain text! - Now we have created a separate table for assignments"" sounds ambiguous - does it mean a new database table or a html table..? Please be specific. - ""A helper function was also added to format a string into multiple lines"" - please mention what the string is about (what it represents), what are these multiple lines that it is getting split into, and why you would want to split them. - Test Cases are not stated. Test Plan does mention one as ""for example"" but the testing process could've been given a little more respect. :)",1212947,1,8066
"The write up is lacking screenshots, for example, the colour coded views etc and the test plan to verify the issues. Only the test plan for colour coding has been mentioned. The issues and the plan of action have been described properly.",1213957,1,8066
I think the code need some amount of refactoring before it can be merged with the expertiza master and pushed to production. Some of the functions implemented by the team seem quite long and they should try and restrict the functionality implemented in each function to just one.,1214036,-1,8066
"The code seems very well written and approach seems correct. If they improve the documentation and add test cases after thorough testing, it should be good to be deployed. As it stands, another team in future can pickup the code and implement these improvements.",1211612,-1,8066
"The view file contain 200 more files so it is quite difficult to figure out the structure of the View. It is better if independent component is introduced to construct the whole task view. And the commits contain the Gemfile, which is considered not secure to deploy for it alters the production environment. ",1211820,1,8066
Codewise no issues. Build issue has to be fixed.,1212570,1,8066
Not able to see the changes done by the team. Test plan could have been explained better. If the URL or the screencast was provided it would have been better.,1211778,1,8066
"No. i can not see any link of video to check the changed functionality or system, hence it is difficult to pass the changes to production. Yes new team can take up remaining changes and provide a working system.  ",1211933,1,8066

No link of the pull request provided.,1211774,1,8066
The travis CI build did not pass. But the tests on which the build fails has no direct relationship with the code that the team has changed or added.,1214032,1,8066
Travis CI build is failing. Other things are fine.,1212566,-1,8066
The Travis build passed but there are a lot of warnings and issues that have not been fixed. MAny of them are trivial and easy to fix. ,1211608,1,8066

Everything looks fine to me.,1212415,-1,8090
The writeup is great. I was able to understand the issue and do manual testing.,1212548,-1,8090
The write up has most of the relevant information. The formatting could have been better. I would suggest the team to use a standard dimension for the screenshots they have added.,1214252,1,8090
It was very well-written and self explanatory.,1212814,-1,8090
The wiki page has been written concisely. The team has used screenshots which ease the understanding of the work they've done. ,1213717,-1,8090
The write-up clearly explains the issues faced and the code fixes used to solve them.,1212884,-1,8090
Comprehensive.,1212416,-1,8090
"Yes, the code changes are simple and to the point. I don't see any other way it could be done. ",1212549,-1,8090
The user name issue seems to not have been resolved when tested manually. The code may be deployable and would not cause a problem since there are not many complicated changes.,1214253,-1,8090
I think work is still needed on this project. All test cases are not able to pass so.,1212815,1,8090
I did not understand why is it necessary to prohibit spaces in usernames. I believe the code could have been modified to work with spaces as well,1212969,1,8090

No updates after first review.,1212781,1,8094
The code is well written and understandable. ,1214191,-1,8094
Looks good. Function name componentDidMount is a bit confusing.,1212404,1,8094
The code is well written and has proper functions to handle each action. Not too long functions and names are aptly defined,1214142,-1,8094
Code is written well without dead or complicated code. DRY principle is followed. I can not see any changes or commits in code after last submission.,1211835,1,8094
Comments in the code would have been helpful to understand the flow.,1212767,1,8094
The code seemed to be well-written and properly commented. Comments made it very easy to understand the code.,1214219,-1,8094
"I can't examine the code because a link to the repository is not actually given in the project, and when I navigate to their repository, I can't figure out which branch is the correct one; however, from the details of the writeup, it seems as though the code is well written.",1212193,1,8094
The code was already well-written . The team did a great work in following coding best practices. The team should have include code comments to make the code easier to understand.,1213360,1,8094
The code is well-written and there are no bad names or long functions. The coding style is also pertaining to the Ruby standards. Although it would be good if they could work in making the code more 'DRY' by making suggested changes to the code.  ,1213064,1,8094
"Overall the code is written really well. Snake casing has been thoroughly followed and in case of JavaScript, the camel casing is followed.  No additional suggestions.",1213106,-1,8094

No new commits were made during the 2nd round.,1214220,1,8094
"I can't actually see this team's repository because they linked the expertiza/expertiza pull request, but it doesn't look like new code was committed in the second round.",1212194,1,8094
There was one new commit during the second round.,1213361,1,8094
"Yes, there is one commit during round 2, and it fixed trivial rubcop issues related to indentation.  Two suggestions of adding meaningful comments for tree_display function in tree_display.jsx and second on having a single copy of RubricArray for two functions were not implemented.",1213065,1,8094
No additional commits were found considering one issue was still left to be implemented. Suggestion: There should have been some commits present pertaining to test cases or at least the 3rd issue that was not implemented.,1213107,1,8094
"No new test were added and existing test are failing.

I don't see any test cases added. The overall coverage has decreased by 2.99% to 33.88%. ,1214194,1,8094
No test plans added and the coverage decreased in the pull request. Test plans are not needed for the project,1214145,1,8094
No test plan added and no test cases written in code as well as in wiki.,1211838,1,8094
The test coverage has decreased by 2%.,1212770,1,8094
 No test cases were added and the coverage decreased.  The overall coverage decreased (-2.9%) to 33.88%.,1214222,1,8094
"The test coverage decreased, but I'm not really worried about that because that seems to be a common theme with many of the refactoring projects.",1212196,1,8094
The team has not added any test case for the implementation. The overall test coverage has decreased.,1213363,1,8094
"No new tests have been added to the project. Commits for the first round had increased the code coverage by .0004 which was good, but the code coverage has decreased by 2.9% as per the latest build report.",1213067,1,8094
The team did not add any test cases.  The coverage did not increase as a result of that.  Suggestion: Unit test cases should have been written as a part of the final deliverable.,1213109,1,8094
The team might has out 2 issues to be resolved.,1212785,1,8094
"On checking the videos, the functionality seems to be working fine. I haven't been able to manually test it.",1214195,1,8094
No link provided but the videos shows that everything is working well.,1212408,-1,8094
No UI provided but videos are uploaded to demonstrate the functionality,1214146,1,8094
"2 Issues are resolved and when checked from UI, features are working as expected. Seems like no code refactoring is required. ",1211839,-1,8094
"Manual testing could not be performed due to lack of project deployment. But, the screencasts show that everything works fine.",1214223,-1,8094
"The UI seems to work as it should, at least from the writeup. ",1212197,-1,8094
The team only implemented 2/3 parts of the project and has not created the tests for the same. The CI build is also failing for the pull request. The functionalities implemented are working as expected. ,1213364,1,8094
"The team has uploaded manual testing screencast to show fixes for 2 out of 3 issues to be fixed, and everything works as expected. The audio in the screencast helps clearly understand the before and after scenarios. However, there are no corresponding test cases to test the fixes. No changes have been done to the spec file.",1213068,1,8094
"The project was not deployed. The project should have been deployed. However, the video that the team uploaded shows the 2 functionalities that they have implemented. And they work as intended. Suggestion: One feature was not implemented (3rd issue) and should have been done as a part of the deliverable. And the project should have been deployed.",1213110,1,8094
Unable to find any difference after the first review although the team had to explain about some issues.,1212786,1,8094
The writeup is great and descriptive. I could find all the info I needed.,1214196,-1,8094
It looks decent. The screenshots should be with the issue write up and not at the end,1212409,1,8094
The writeup is very explanatory with all the screenshots attached which helps in better understanding,1214147,-1,8094
Write up is written well and it is understandable. Images are not in proportion and not of same size and hence wiki page does not look steady. Team can work on image size and image description and manual test plan in more detail.,1211840,1,8094
The content is good and explanatory but the writing styles needs to be improved as there is inconsistency in the font size and font type.,1212772,1,8094
"The writeup was well written and easy to understand. However, it would have been better if some steps accompanied the screenshots as to what was happening in each screenshot. That would have made the writeup even easier to understand.",1214224,1,8094
"The writeup thoroughly details the changes written in this project, but the first section seems like informally written reminders for the development team.",1212198,1,8094
The write-up is well written and organised. Everything looks fine. The team should have mentioned about the approach taken to solve the mentioned problem statement which will make the implementation easier to understand.   ,1213365,1,8094
"The write is well-organized and clear in its material. The authors have improved the write-up by explaining what each newly defined functions work. and added code snippets wherever necessary.  However, the test plan is still missing from the write-up.",1213069,1,8094
The write up is well written and explain the features that the team has implemented in a verbose manner.  The writeup mentions solution description which gives a walk through about what steps were taken to implement the functionality.  No suggestions.,1213111,-1,8094
The team has definitely resolved one issue. This could be a starting point for future teams.,1212787,-1,8094
"Yes, the code is written aptly and to the point. I don't see any issues.",1214197,-1,8094
"No,it should not deployed till the build is fixed. It is a good starting place for a future team to pick up",1212410,1,8094
Yes just a few test plans needed and the code can be deployed on production server. ,1214148,-1,8094
Two issues resolved seem like working pretty well and can be deployed in production. Third unresolved issue is a good start for future team to pick up.,1211841,1,8094
This code can be deployed after solving the issues generated by Travis CI.,1212773,-1,8094
The approach seems to be correct and the writeup ready to be deployed.,1214225,-1,8094
"I don't think this code is ready to be deployed due to the fact that I can't actually examine the functionality, nor can I see the actual repository this project was written in.",1212199,1,8094
the code looks fine. The only concern is related to the CI build which is failing at the moment. Some of the tests are failing because of the change.,1213366,1,8094
"I think that the team has done a great work for the future team to pick up. They can improve it by adding comments for newly defined functions. Although, the pull request build has not passed, after fixing the conflicts, the new team can readily work ahead on the remaining issues.",1213070,1,8094
"I do not think the code should be deployed. The test cases are not yet written and there are a few code climate issues. Due to the lack of test cases, the Travis CI build has also failed.  Suggestion: Once they are resolved the code can be deployed. There is one remaining issue, but that could be done in the next iteration. ",1213112,1,8094
Not able to merge. Issues regarding Travis tests etc need to be resolved.,1212783,1,8094
The Travis CI build has failed.,1214193,1,8094
feature and controller test failing. Mentioned in the previous review as well. Travis Failing and issues with code climate as well,1212406,1,8094
Travis test build have failed. Can write version compatible code,1214144,1,8094
"Pull request is not accepted, also build did not pass Travis CI. But the functionalities improved and accepted and working fine. ",1211837,1,8094
The Travis CI test has been failed.,1212769,1,8094
"No, the build did not pass in Travis CI. several checks were failed but there was no conflict with the base branch.",1214221,1,8094
"The pull request did not pass Travis CI, but there were no conflicts.",1212195,1,8094
The CI build was failing in the previous submission as well in the new submission. The team should have corrected the same.  ,1213362,1,8094
"No, the build for the pull request does not pass. The build had 4 jobs, out of which 2 jobs passed successfully. However, 2 build jobs have errors. First job failure is related to webdriver error for chrome where test fails. Second job failure is related to NoMethodError for method []",1213066,1,8094
The Travis CI test did not past.  I did not find any test cases written. Suggestion: Test cases should have been written as a part of the final deliverable.,1213108,1,8094
"Not very good, some problems existing during the first round are still here.",1214114,1,8117
This is a code and project that has been honed into perfection. The team has shown due diligence and taken care of long and complicated functions and somewhat shaky coding style from the last submission. They have refactored the code to perfection thus fulfilling all their objectives. ,1213005,-1,8117
The overall structure of the code looks good and all the coding standards have been followed. I feel like there could have been more comments to support the large amounts of changes that have been made.,1213019,-1,8117
"Most of the updated code is well written. Some functions could have been shortened. For example, in the set_display_type function, instead of writing a 'when' statement for each of the options, you could have stored them in a hashmap and set display type to that value if it exists in the hashmap.",1212648,1,8117
The code is well written. It follows DRY principle. It would have been better if more comments were added.,1214121,1,8117
"The code follows good coding style, adheres to naming standards and is DRY. However, the suggested changes since last round have not been implemented which emphasized on shortening the length of long functions create and view.",1213751,1,8117
The code follows the general guidelines for standard RSpec practices and also keeps the DRY principle in check. It makes a good use of names to specify what each attribute is assigned for.,1213286,-1,8117
"No, they seems did not commit again",1214115,1,8117
"No, the strange part is the code hasn't been committed during the second round. It is strange because they have surely seem to have achieved all their requirements to problems going by the wiki page so, why haven't they committed the new changes is the question. ",1213006,1,8117
No new commits were made during 2nd round.,1214122,1,8117
There have been no new commits since the last round of submission. There seems to be some work pending since the last round for integrating the branch.,1213752,1,8117
No new commits were committed for the second round. It was cleaned up 13 days ago.,1213287,-1,8117
No new commits were made during the second round. The latest commit was on October 31st.,1212649,-1,8117
There was a substantial amount of commits done in the first phase of the project but I don't see any commits in the second phase. This could very possibly be because the team might have completed the requirement in the first phase itself.,1213020,-1,8117
"There have been no additions to test cases, although they have added a test case in last round.  The test coverage has significantly gone down by 39.4% after their code changes.",1213754,1,8117
"No, they did not commit any new code, so no coverage increased.",1214117,1,8117
"Yes, an excellent job in that regard. They have first explained their test plans, then even provided links to their RSPEC tests which I checked. Then they have run and shown their screenshots of the Rspec tests going through successfully. ",1213008,-1,8117
The team has made sure to write the relevant test cases wherever possible. But the overall coverage has decreased. In my opinion the newly added test cases cover more or less the entire range of this project. But I think that they need to focus a bit more on the test casses.,1213022,1,8117
"Yes, the team did add test cases to test their changes, but the overall test coverage has decreased ",1212651,1,8117
The team did not perform any changes from the first round. No test cases were added and the coverage remained the same. The test cases from the previous round considerably fulfill the range of the project.,1213289,1,8117
"No, it did not work intended.",1214118,1,8117
"According to the screenshots uploaded by the authors, the features work as they are supposed to. New questionnaires have been successfully created.",1212652,-1,8117
There wasn't any link provided to check if the UI was working fine. This project was majorly focussed on refactor and looking at the code changes in the PR I can guess that the features might be working as they were supposed to.,1213023,1,8117
N link to the deployed version is provided hence cannot comment on this question,1214125,1,8117
"Yes, the code has been refactored to cover all the intended scenarios and the tests have been very well document along with testing the edge cases. As per their approach the first segregated the tests for questionnaires_controller into two test files, questionnaires_controller_spec and quiz_questionnaires_controller_spec and separated the tests for CRUD operations of quiz_questionnaires_controller into the quiz_questionnaires_controller_spec, renaming them from view_quiz, create_quiz and the like to view and create. This in my opinion is a thorough enough test. ",1213009,-1,8117
"The team has added screenshots on the submission page, which show that the UI is working as intended.  However, it had been more clear had they made a screencast of the same.",1213755,1,8117
"The system works as intended. The project required to make the features work such as removing hardcoded parameters as save_choice method, replacing switch statements with subclass methods and creating models for the subclasses. ",1213290,-1,8117
"I don not think it's good, because they just paste most of their code on the writeup.",1214119,1,8117
"Extremely well written Wiki Page, thorough and to the point with enough technical content and relevant screenshots pertaining to the before and after scenarios of the problem statements. ",1213010,-1,8117
"Overall, the writeup was pretty good. Everything is explained in a good way with the help of code snippets and screenshots. There is definitely lack of explanation on how to check the work. THis is the only thing that I found where the writeup could've focussed more. Other than that it looks good.",1213024,1,8117
"The writeup has been pretty well written by the team. Introduction to the problem statement, the implementation details, and the test plans have been stated.  ",1212653,-1,8117
Alignment issues for the content,1213824,1,8117
The authors have portrayed their work by adding many code snippets. It is cumbersome to go through the entire code in the write-up. A general approach towards refactoring principles used would have been impressive.,1213756,1,8117
The writeup gives a gist of the work carried out by team throughout the project. The team added the Test Plan section describing the testing procedures carried out. It is also structured nicely allowing the reader to understand the project in it's entirety.,1213291,-1,8117
"No, they didn't pass Travis CI. ",1214116,1,8117
"No, according to Travis CI the build doesn't seem to have passed due to some bundle install errors. Although they surely should have resolved it because the code wouldn't be able to achieve the above results as stated by their photos and wikipedia page. ",1213007,1,8117
"The code has been merged in a good way and there have been no merge conflicts so far which is commendable. However, the Travis CI was failing and the code climate check was failing too. This is something that the team must look into and make sure that the changes that they have made are consistent with the existing expertiza code.",1213021,1,8117
The pull request did not pass the Travis CI build. There are no conflicts with the base branch. ,1212650,1,8117
"The pull request still shows that the build fails. On observing the logs, there is only one build job which fails due to a ActionNotFound error for view_action method. This needs to be looked at.",1213753,1,8117
"The build for the Travis CI fails and also the code climate shows 79 issues to be resolved. However, it does pass the Danger Bot with considerable warnings. ",1213288,1,8117
"No, I think they code have some bugs in there.",1214120,1,8117
"Surely, once the code is sufficiently tested by the TAs, then it is can surely be implemented as a change. Even so, the Travis CI and the overall Coverage should be verified first. Going by their page, it is a finished project and hence no use giving it to the next semester as a project. ",1213011,-1,8117
"The code has been working fine, and once the integration conflict is solved, seems ready to be deployed. The future team will be able to pick up from where the current team has left.",1213757,-1,8117
Even though the code has been refactored keeping in mind the coding standards but I think that there is still room for improvement in writing the test cases and the PR checks should be checked as well since they are failing. This is something that the next team could pickup and then the code could be ready to be deployed on the production server.,1213025,1,8117
"Since the Travis test has failed and the test coverage has also decreased, merging the code would not be a good idea. The project doesn't need to be redone from scratch, some modifications to the existing work could make the project ready for deployment.",1212654,1,8117
There is significant improvement in the write up after the first round. It gives good idea of the project.,1214126,-1,8117
"The code enables properly testing the various features and describes the system working as desired. However, since the Travis build did not pass, the code could be deployed but with careful intervention by the developer. It could be taken up from here and does not require to be redone from scratch.",1213292,1,8117
"The overall code quality is moderate. I would suggest the team to either use hexadecimal color codes or names, to ensure that the code remains consistent.",1214282,1,8109
The code changes seem to be fine. I do not see any problems regarding the code as it is pretty well explained in the wiki as well.,1213346,-1,8109
Code is written properly with no bad naming conventions. No major code change can be seen after first submission.  Code is DRY. But I could not see color change specific comments in the code. ,1211765,1,8109
"Overall, the code was well written. As mentioned earlier, the only change the team had to make was add color codes. Hence, no mistake was made in the first round itself. Good Job.",1214023,-1,8109
Everything seems good.,1212627,-1,8109
CSS snippets are still written inline. No changes were made after round 1,1213367,-1,8109
"Code looks good, there weren't many changes and mostly are HTML changes so no commenting is required as such as well. ",1212095,-1,8109
"The code was very well written. However, that should be a given considering the complexity of the project which wasn't a whole lot.",1213120,-1,8109
Code is still using DRY principles,1213801,-1,8109
"It was a simple UI color change, so not many categories are not applicable. the code can be DRY, by using the CSS file for styles. Also there is no need to add colors in bothand .  would suffice",1211473,1,8109
No new commits were made during round 2.,1214283,-1,8109
"The last commit was made 9 days ago as per the given link. There were not many changes required, so seems fine.",1213347,-1,8109
I can not see any new commits in second submission as the functionality was working properly in first submission itself.,1211766,-1,8109
New commits were not added in the 2nd round. In my opinion they were not required as well as the team completed their task in the first round itself.,1214024,-1,8109
No new content was necessary during the second round.,1212628,-1,8109
No commit has been added since round 1. They should have fixed the build failure which is probably happening because they have pushed changes few extra changes in schema.rb which I don't think is required for this project.,1212096,1,8109
No there were no new commits due to the fact that were no changes to be made,1213121,-1,8109
Yes,1213802,-1,8109
No new Commits,1211474,-1,8109
No test cases were added. No real scope for the test cases to be added to test changes made to HTML code.,1214285,-1,8109
The test cases are added with good explanation. It does increase the code coverage. The thing I liked that the screenshots itself speak for the test cases.,1213349,-1,8109
"As mentioned in wiki page by team, color change does not affect button functionality, hence no test plan is required. Hence giving full points here.",1211768,-1,8109
"Unfortunately, no tests were added. It would have been good if the team added test cases to check their UI changes.",1214026,1,8109
"Um, somehow your commits increase the overall coverage of the project (and as mentioned in the write-up, test cases aren't possible). ",1212630,-1,8109
"It's UI project, testing isn't required as such. They have still mentioned in there documentation.",1212098,-1,8109
They have added test cases and the coverage did increase but only by a little amount. They should have considered adding more test cases since the task of changing the color of the links was such a minuscule one.,1213123,1,8109
There are no test cases as it is an UI specific project,1213804,-1,8109
No tests were added as part of the project. just minimal UI changes,1211476,-1,8109
The code that is written has long functions. Few names do not really provide the gist of what the function is intending to perform,1212025,1,8047
The git link to the code repository is not provided.,1212592,0,8047

"Without a video or instructions, I cannot easily verify that the solution works since there was an error thrown when I tried to follow the recipe. The error occurred while I was trying to request an account. More detailed testing recipes would help.

writeup covers all the specifications and descriptions but is too lengthy.,1212156,1,8047
The write-up is well explained along with the test plans explained in steps to make it easy for testing but that just have a few cases with cover basic functionalities,1212030,1,8047
"The write-up is very detailed as to what features have been implemented but lacks on explaining how they are implemented. It can be improved by adding how the features have been implemented, why they chose this logic to implement the features.",1212961,1,8047
Writeup is decent. I felt that code should have been quoted rather than included pictures of as that would make it easier to modify. The pngs weren't same size which appears to be negative that people  have commented on my work too.,1212996,1,8047
"Write up is Okay, The test plan comes before solution / approach section . pls change the ordering. there is no reference section  instead of putting screen shots of code it would be better if the authors had put code snippets  ",1214098,1,8047
"It looks like the code is almost ready, but there are simply some failing tests to get past.",1214085,1,8047
"No this code is not ready to be deployed onto the production server. Minor bugs said by the Travis CI can be fixed. Also, Add test cases and after thorough testing, it should be good to be deployed and hence this will be a good starting place for a future team to pick up.",1212962,1,8047
No the build failure needs to be investigated. Some refactoring regarding the messaging should be done. instead of hard coding the mail it should be read from a config file. ,1214099,1,8047
The build does not pass. It looks like some failing new tests are the issue.,1214081,1,8047
build not pass in travis ci.,1212153,1,8047
Not it didnt pass the test. ,1212027,1,8047
The Travis builds have failed but there are no conflicts to be resolved. ,1213192,1,8047
Build did not pass Travis CI but there are a lot of warnings and issues that have not been fixed. Many of them are trivial and easy to fix. ,1212958,1,8047
The build did not pass in Travis CI. There was one failure which needs to be fixed.,1212874,1,8047
"Build failing due to bad test. Log shows one error for now. Also, I have a feeling tests on some projects aren't able to run all test- the coverage log for this PR shows that none of the files are getting covered: https://coveralls.io/jobs/41685719",1212993,1,8047
No Build still fails in spite of asking them to fix the build issues in first place,1214095,1,8047
"The code consists of small methods that mostly test one thing. This results in high readability. The team has made an extensive use of 'context' constructs which further enhance the code documentation. Moreover, the team has improved the .sort_by_name method making it cleaner and easier to follow. This was complemented by the fix of bad names that were present in the first round (e.g. stu1, p1 etc.). One suggestion pertaining to the '#scores' block would be to use specific assertions of fields instead of testing the object via inspect method and comparing it to the string value.",1211466,-1,8040
"The team has made two commits since the first review. The issues that were covered were '#scores' block and mock instance handling. However, the primary problem that the spec is testing an instance of AssignmentParticipant class instead of Participant was not addressed.",1211467,1,8040
The build did not pass Travis CI. The reason is because #scores method is commented out from the AssignmentParticipant class.,1211468,1,8040
"The coverage has increased from ~77% to ~94% which is impressive. However, the previous issue was that #scores method of Participant was not called because the object that is being tested in this project is an instance of AssignmentParticipant class. This problem was handled by commenting out the #scores method of AssignmentParticipant so that Participant #scores method will be called instead. This breaks other parts of the code which depend on AssignmentParticipant's #scores implementation. The solution to this problem is to either define a new Participant class instance in the factory or to define it in the test code itself.",1211469,1,8040
The code coverage is ~94% which passes the required threshold.,1211470,-1,8040
The writeup is comprehensive and fully covers given functionality. There were no significant issues that needed to be fixed from the first round. ,1211471,-1,8040
"The project covers a significant part of the functionality for testing the participant. However, the biggest problem is that the #scores method is commented out from the class AssignmentParticipant. Obviously this will break the existing code that relies on that functionality. Furthermore, the future testing will possibly become complicated because the object under test for participant_spec.rb is an instance of AssignmentParticipant as opposed to Participant.",1211472,1,8040
"It says it failed, but I am not sure the most recent commit has been checked yet.",1213728,1,8040

"There were many lingering code climate issues, and the Danger bot and Travis didn't pass either. A little cleaning could be done.",1211781,1,8040
Coverage increased by 3%.,1211782,-1,8040
Video demonstrates working and passing tests.,1211783,-1,8040
"The writeup is detailed, but it doesn't explain why code in the model had to be commented out very well. That was a bit alarming.",1211784,1,8040
"The unit tests affording 95% coverage is great, but the code climate and other build problems are a bit concerning. I think this could be pulled in with more attention from the developers.",1211785,1,8040
The overall structure of the code looks good and all the coding standards have been followed. I feel like there could have been more comments to support the large amounts of changes that have been made.,1211438,1,8038
A huge improvement from Round 1. In round one not much code was submitted so this is a huge improvement. Keep it up. I have a Suggestion: It is very important to have comments in the code which will help other readers understand your code or in this case understand what you have tested without having to look for any other documentation which explains it. (Code file should be self sufficient),1212214,1,8038
Lack of Comments,1212704,1,8038
Well Written,1213744,-1,8038
"Your team have put all ""let"" behind the code. However, there are, still, a lot of 'let(:response) { VmQuestionResponse.new(review_questionnaire, assignment, 1) }'. It is repetitive and unnecessary.  ",1212074,1,8038
"Documentation is well-written, instructions is given. Problem statement and solutions are provided. Screenshots are given.",1212676,-1,8038
"The structure of codes is not very good, that is, for a ""it"" statement, there are two many things include in it to be tested. It is better to separate  the test cases clearly. Besides, the objects seem not store in factories properly.",1212697,1,8038
No the new code was not committed during the second round. This could be due to the fact that the team finished their code at the end of the first round itself.,1211439,1,8038
No code was committed during round 1. Most of the code was committed during second round based on reviews of Round 1.,1212215,1,8038
"Yes, new commits were done in the 2nd round.",1212705,-1,8038
There are minor fixes related to code style.,1211998,-1,8038
No new commits.,1212677,1,8038
The team makes several commits during the 2nd round to make improvement.,1212698,-1,8038
Yes the team added test cases and the overall test coverage has increased.The team has added a lot of tests and I do feel it does cover the range of this project.,1211441,-1,8038
It is a testing project so test cases are added. The coverage has increased to 97.5 percent for Vm-Question Response Model.,1212217,-1,8038
"Yes, the coverage has increased and test cases have been added. Coverage is more than 50%.",1212707,-1,8038
Coverage has increased from 11 to 97%. It is impressive. Great Job! The team has achieved what they were looking for.,1212679,-1,8038
The team added new test cases and make the coverage increase also the overall coverage for the whole system has increased,1212700,-1,8038
There wasn't any link provided to check if the UI was working fine. But there was a YouTube video showing the tests successfully running. And also the tests did seem to cover almost all the scenarios.,1211442,-1,8038
Yes almost all scenarios for vm_question_response model is covered. Good work.,1212218,-1,8038
This testing project covers all the scenario as required.,1212708,-1,8038
"Since these are unit tests, no UI test needed.",1212680,-1,8038
"The test cover most cases, but some scenarios like different cases for the if statement for add/team method is not sufficient.",1212701,1,8038
The team has heeded to the advice given in the last round and explained their tests in a more detailed manner. I do feel that the write up is well written and covers almost all the important points of the project. But I do feel images showing their tests running successfully could be added to the results part of the writeup.,1211443,1,8038
The write-up explains what functionality is tested and why. The coverage is also mentioned along with code snippets which is good.,1212219,-1,8038
Writeup is well written and gives explanation for all the requirements.,1212709,-1,8038
"The description for the background, motivation and the deign is not very clear. The team can give more detailed introduction specific to this project.",1212702,1,8038
"I do believe the code could be deployed after a bit of refactoring is done as suggested by the code climate tests. But overall looking at only the functionality of the code, it is ready to be deployed",1211444,1,8038
"It is a testing project which aims at improving test coverage. So production deployment is not in question. However before merging the code to Master branch here are a few recommended changes. 1) Adding comments to improve readability and understanding for future use. 2) Avoid using comments like ""I swear this is the last one"". They do not explain anything about what you changed from your last commit and why. Proper professional comments are expected. All these comments should be refactored.",1212220,1,8038
Ready to be deploy but must resolve the build issues.,1212710,1,8038
I am not sure since these are Unit tests and there are Travis tests failures too. Need to check with the team and mentors. ,1212682,1,8038
"The test made the coverage increase, but it still have room to improve its structure to make it more clear and useful.",1212703,1,8038
The code has been merged in a good way and there have been no merge conflicts. The build did pass the Travis CI. The code climate test failed but those were small issues which can easily fixed by just revisiting the code.,1211440,1,8038
Travis CI has error ed. The tests fail.However there are no conflicts with the base branch or master branch.,1212216,1,8038
The build has failed in Travis CI.,1212706,1,8038
Travis Passed. Code Climate has 82 issues,1213746,1,8038
"Build does not pass. Also, code climate issues are observed.",1211999,1,8038
Travis test did not pass. Errors were not fixed. Continuous Integration failure. ,1212678,1,8038
"there is no code included in the write-up,but the team had mentioned the changed files in the write.As a reviewer, it is difficult to find out which code has been added by the team. The team should clearly explain what they are doing.",1213429,1,8030
"The code is well written, the way the list function was split into multiple modular functions is appreciable. A great amount of effort has gone into fixing the issues.",1213952,-1,8030
"Code is written very well, comments are detailed and functions and variables are named appropriately. (would just like to point out, in student_task_helper.rb#due_date_color , the variable ""rtn"" could've been named better!)",1212942,-1,8030
New code added is written well with DRY and no long or complicated functions. I could see file updated has changes on line such as tab and space. Team could work upon indentation. ,1211927,-1,8030
"Code Snippet added.  Still, Git link is not of the pull request.   No link provided for the change. Either screencast or the URL of the deployed application would have been ideal.",1211772,1,8030
"The code written is following the Ruby on rails guidelines. The variables, methods, and class names do seem to follow proper convention and are suggestive of the functionality they are being used for. In some cases they could have used a little more descriptive names for variables for example inside app/helpers/student_task_helper.rb  they could have used background_colour instead of rtn as a variable name in the due_date_color() method. It will become more readable for the reviewers to understand the functionalities. Also they have added to few commits for the amount of code change that they have done. The commit messages  are not descriptive enough about what changes have the authors committed. ",1214030,1,8030
The code is well written. No issues with naming conventions or coding style.,1212564,-1,8030
The code is very well written and comments are properly given. Also the variables are descriptive and ruby guidelines are followed.,1211606,-1,8030
The code is clean.,1211627,-1,8030
overall only 3 commits are made during the entire project. no new code was committed during the second round,1213430,1,8030
No changes were committed in round 2.,1213953,1,8030
Could not see any new commits after last change. Also commits distribution is not equal.,1211928,1,8030
No New commits.,1211773,1,8030
No new commit has been added since the last submission. The commit messages are not descriptive. They should commit small portions of code one by one with proper description of the changes in the commit  message. Also their functions seem to be very long. they may consider refactoring and creating more cohesive code. Each function should do only one task.,1214031,1,8030
No new commits in the second round.,1212565,1,8030
"There have been only two commits - one on 30th Oct and second on 31st October. There have been no commits since. It would have been better if you people had given one more commit resolving the issues given by code climate, since most of them are trivial. ",1211607,1,8030
The last commit is on 10/31.,1211628,-1,8030
No test cases are added by the team and overall coverage of the project is decreased by 10.6%.,1213432,1,8030
The team has added testcases but lacks coverage. The overall coverage decreased by 10.6% to 37.063%.,1213955,1,8030
Test are written ,1212945,-1,8030
Team could have added test plan in wiki along with test covered and test description. Also could have worked upon increasing test coverage.,1211930,1,8030
Test Plan could be described better.,1211775,1,8030
the team has implemented there testing plan and have been very thorough with there test cases. They seem to have considered a lot of cases and have implemented them in rspec. The only thing that they should do is use different commits for adding test cases.,1214033,-1,8030
No new test cases are written.,1212567,1,8030
"Well, the code looks good and very much follows the Ruby Style Guide. The code also is DRY. It looks well written and does not any changes.",1211550,-1,8040
"It is given in wiki that most of your test cases depend on checking the output. However, like I mentioned in my last review, several test cases like the ones mentioned below can be automated. This is especially true as TDD is explicitly mentioned in your problem statement: ""Write the required tests before implementing/refactoring the methods in the above-mentioned classes"".  Add past due assignments to the students task list (on Student View). Check for correction in due dates of assignments (when an assignments due date is edited, it should be appropriately moved from the Past assignments list to the Current Assignments list if needed) On Student Task page, separate the list of 'teamed with' students from the current tasks box. ",1211609,-1,8030
Yes.,1211630,-1,8030
In documentation it mentions participant.rb model file is changed to for increasing code coverage. However the file is missing in the pull request generated. There is no mention about changes in the assignment_participant.rb file. But that is present in the pull request. It may be a name mismatch or some files are indeed missing. I pointed it out during the first review but changes are not incorporated currently. The code overall looks good. Proper variable names are used. Commenting is required,1212306,1,8040
I could neither test it manually nor there were any videos to check the functionality.,1213956,1,8030
"The code is both succinct and very carefully. i have not done the code check in the first round. but for this time, there's no bad names, functions are standardly-named, good alignment and commenting.",1214577,-1,8040
Project was on implementing test cases. The test cases are well written and the code coverage has increased.,1212320,-1,8040
"I could not get a deployment link or watch a video that demonstrates the work done. So, I'm unable to test.",1212946,1,8030
The code is very well written and follows good coding practice,1213447,-1,8040
The code follows Ruby style guide.,1214268,-1,8040
I can not see any link to test changes as well as no video to watch the changes. Team could have shared implemented part to test and review.,1211931,1,8030
No Screencast or deployed URL provided.,1211776,1,8030
The bug fixing does work according to the screenshots provided by the authors. They have provided a step by step screenshot of the issue that they have fixed. The authors haven't hosted their version of the expertiza so it is very difficult to actually check the functionality. They could have hosted expertiza on VCL or they could have put a screen cast of the working functionality to help in reviewing.,1214034,1,8030
"Yes, it works as intended. It would be better if you could add a video recording of the flow/screenshots of the flow in the test plan. ",1212568,-1,8030
The operations work as intended but need to have automated test cases.,1211610,1,8030
Write-up needs serious attention of the team. The approach followed is good but it still needs to be worked on. the write-up should include contents which makes it self-explanatory.,1213434,1,8030
"The write up is lacking screenshots, for example, the colour coded views etc and the test plan to verify the issues. Only the test plan for colour coding has been mentioned. The issues and the plan of action have been described properly.",1213957,1,8030
"Yes, new code was committed in the 2nd round.",1211551,-1,8040
Yes code was committed to follow clean code practices based on first review.,1212307,-1,8040
"According to the github page, it doesn't seems that new code are commited",1214578,1,8040
"- The write-up does mention the files changed but misses out on adding code snippets. - Little formatting inconsistencies found like ""-- Expertiza Project"" in the introduction, and a "":-"" only for Overview but none of the other headings. - Looks like ""Separate the list of 'teamed with' students from the current tasks box"" needs to be a heading rather than plain text! - Now we have created a separate table for assignments"" sounds ambiguous - does it mean a new database table or a html table..? Please be specific. - ""A helper function was also added to format a string into multiple lines"" - please mention what the string is about (what it represents), what are these multiple lines that it is getting split into, and why you would want to split them. - Test Cases are not stated. Test Plan does mention one as ""for example"" but the testing process could've been given a little more respect. :)",1212947,1,8030
Code was not committed in second round.,1212321,1,8040
"I do not see any new commit after 5th November. In my opinion, some of the tests could be made more articulate in round 2.",1214269,1,8040
Write up is too brief. No detail description of approach taken as well as no picture to relate to changes as suggested to add in last review.  ,1211932,1,8030
Write-up is explained pretty well.,1211777,-1,8030
The wiki documentation has been updated. All the information has been documented in a neat and logical manner. The write up adequately provides what functionality the work is related to. They havent updated any part of the wiki documentation but overall their documentation is concise and to the point.,1214035,-1,8030
Detailed. But the screenshots of the manual testing are missing in the test plan.,1212569,1,8030
"The write-up is very detailed as to what features have been implemented but lacks on explaining how they are implemented. It can be improved by adding how the features have been implemented, why they chose this logic to implement the features and how to test the code or show how they have tested the code.",1211611,1,8030
"lacking necessary UI description, eg, the final appearance of the task list or the pathway to show a task list.",1211819,1,8030
"before deploying the project onto the production server, this projects asks  for some attention. new test cases should be added to the project. I can't say much on that.",1213435,-1,8030
"Yes, the code has been written aptly and to the point. The intention is clear.",1213958,-1,8030
No new code was committed in the second round,1213448,1,8040
"Code looks okay, and the spec is written in detail. But as mentioned earlier, I'm not in a position to judge due to lack of video or deployment link or even some screenshots proving the work.",1212948,1,8030
"Test coverage remains the same at 94%. Hence, my suggestion/opinion is same as the previous review.",1214271,-1,8040
Yes they have added test case and it has increased the coverage by 3% and has increased the coverage to 39.721%,1213450,-1,8040
Project was writing unit test cases and the newly written test cases has increased the test cases.,1212323,-1,8040
"According to the github page, no new test cases",1214580,1,8040
Test coverage for assignment_participant model increased to 94 percent.,1212309,-1,8040
"No. i can not see any link of video to check the changed functionality or system, hence it is difficult to pass the changes to production. Yes new team can take up remaining changes and provide a working system.  ",1211933,1,8030
Not able to see the changes done by the team. Test plan could have been explained better. If the URL or the screencast was provided it would have been better.,1211778,1,8030
"Yes, the team has added test cases and the team has covered every functionality.",1211553,-1,8040
I think the code need some amount of refactoring before it can be merged with the expertiza master and pushed to production. Some of the functions implemented by the team seem quite long and they should try and restrict the functionality implemented in each function to just one.,1214036,1,8030
Codewise no issues. Build issue has to be fixed.,1212570,1,8030
"The code seems very well written and approach seems correct. If they improve the documentation and add test cases after thorough testing, it should be good to be deployed. As it stands, another team in future can pickup the code and implement these improvements.",1211612,-1,8030
I'm afraid no test cases were added in round 2.,1211588,1,8040
"The view file contain 200 more files so it is quite difficult to figure out the structure of the View. It is better if independent component is introduced to construct the whole task view. And the commits contain the Gemfile, which is considered not secure to deploy for it alters the production environment. ",1211820,1,8030
The build fails. there are 3 warnings which needs team's attention. there are no conflicts with the base branch.,1213431,1,8030

"One of the Travis CI tests is failing, https://travis-ci.org/expertiza/expertiza/builds/449165455?utm_source=github_status&utm_medium=notification  Found many ""code climate"" issues.",1212944,1,8030
Pull request is not passed as well as Travis CI is also failed.  ,1211929,1,8030
No link of the pull request provided.,1211774,1,8030
The travis CI build did not pass. But the tests on which the build fails has no direct relationship with the code that the team has changed or added.,1214032,1,8030
Travis CI build is failing. Other things are fine.,1212566,1,8030
The Travis build passed but there are a lot of warnings and issues that have not been fixed. MAny of them are trivial and easy to fix. ,1211608,1,8030
The pull request has some failed cases. no conflict. ,1211816,1,8030
"Except one method, all the other methods have been covered. This is similar to round 1 review given by me.",1214272,1,8040
Yes the test case covers all the required test cases along with the edge cases .,1213451,-1,8040
Project was on writing test cases and the newly written test cases has increased the coverage.,1212324,-1,8040
"Since it's unit test, it seems there's hardly a way to veirify with UI",1214581,1,8040
All the test cases pass. Majority of test scenarios described in document is covered and automated,1212310,-1,8040
There was no working deployment presented.,1211554,1,8040
The writeup seems to be well written. It is concise and to the point.,1214273,-1,8040
The write up is very well documented as it explains the test plans and also what changes have been made along with the reference to the files which have been modified,1213452,-1,8040
Write up is good but the explanation of plan of work could have included some points like the approach taken.,1212325,1,8040
"The writeup is excellent. Very carefully written, a lot of detailed explanation. Some more background information about the functions can be more helpful, as well as syntax summation.",1214582,1,8040
"Explains the testing functionality appropriately. As mentioned in Review one, technicalities are explained thoroughly but the functional knowledge required to understand what the test is doing and why it is doing what it does is missing. Along with mentioning what are the mappings and return values, proper explanation of what the test is written for will be more appropriate in a document.",1212311,1,8040
Very clearly writeup,1212072,-1,8040
"It is well written, quite understandable. It clearly and adequately indicates the working functionality. I can understand what the project is about.",1211555,-1,8040
The writeup is complete and well organized. And it also mentions the corresponding change in origin code.,1211590,-1,8040
"There are several minor issues to be fixed before the code is deployed.  64 code climate issues Travis Build 1 error and 2 warnings. I guess once these are taken care of, the deployment is likely.",1214274,1,8040
"Yes as the test  case increase the test coverage and the build pass is 100% , thus the code is ready to be merged",1213453,-1,8040
Few checks are failing. The checks suggest to use build or double instead of create in test cases.,1212326,1,8040
"Yes, it is a good code.",1214583,-1,8040
"After resolving the issues with Travis tests and adding comments to the code, it is ready to be merged with Master branch. Production deployment in not applicable.",1212312,1,8040
"If they had presented a working deployment, then rest everything was done. So it could be deployed onto the production server.",1211556,1,8040
I'm afraid none of the three checks passed.,1211587,1,8040
"Yes, the Travis CI build was passed. The conflicts could be seen resolved.",1211552,-1,8040
Travis Cl build failed,1212069,1,8040
Travis Tests have failed. No conflicts in the pull request with the master branch.,1212308,1,8040
"Yes, no conflict that's not resolved.",1214579,-1,8040
Checks aren't successful.,1212322,1,8040

"Code is short, variables and functions are well-named.",1212935,-1,8060
The code follows the DRY principles correctly,1212494,-1,8060
"Yes, improved the code.",1212529,-1,8060
"The variables, methods and class names are aptly named. I could not find names which are not suggestive of functionality. (i) The writeup is well written and easy to read and well commented (ii) It is adequately descriptive of the work done. (iii) Explanation of reasons for the style of code and problem solving approach is lacking.",1213092,1,8060
The code is concise and easy to understand. The team has provided comments to explain the logic of the new function created which really helps.,1211962,-1,8060
The code was well-written in the first round itself and followed good coding standards.,1214051,-1,8060
The code was already well-written . No changes were suggested in the first round. The team did a great work in following coding best practices. ,1213176,-1,8060
"yes,  2 commits were made in round 2.",1213034,-1,8060
A few bug fixes were made after the first round of submissions,1212495,-1,8060
"Yes, new commits were done.",1212530,-1,8060
yes,1213142,-1,8060
Yes. Twice during the second round.,1213093,-1,8060
"There were only 2 commits made during the second round. However, the team had mostly implemented most of the functionality during the first round, maybe due to which there are less commits in the second round",1211963,-1,8060
There are no new commits during second round.,1214052,-1,8060
The team did change the project as there are 2 new commits. The CI build is still failing .,1213177,-1,8060
"yes, the team had added 2 test cases and the coverage increase is there as well. Newly added tests are enough to cover the range of project.",1213036,-1,8060
This feature doesn't say the view is of which student. Looking at student_task/list page is confusing since I don't know who am I (which student).,1212938,-1,8060
The team has added test cases but the coverage did not increase by much,1212497,-1,8060
Coverage has increased.,1212532,-1,8060
Coverage increased by a good margin,1211448,-1,8060
"No new test cases are written. From the previous review, The authors have converted all the cases discussed in Test Plan into automated tests. Overall coverage increased (+6.3%) to 43.07%",1213095,-1,8060
"The coverage has increased by 6.3%. The team has added new tests that check whether Assignments is absent in the menu in default view and there is an option to Open Student View. The tests also check whether there is a close button present when the instructor is in the students view, also it checks whether the Assignment is present by default in the student view or not. ",1211965,1,8060
The team has added test cases and increased the test coverage.,1214054,-1,8060
The team has added new testcases in the new submission. The code coverage has also increased. Good work with the testcases.,1213179,-1,8060
The Ui and system operations works well as intended. They newly added features works perfectly as they are supposed to do.,1213037,-1,8060
Everything works as expected except for the case mentioned above.,1212939,-1,8060
Some of the functionalities have been implemented but the pull request is yet to be merged with the master branch,1212498,1,8060
"No credential provided for login. Hence, couldn't check.",1213145,-1,8060
Works as intended. Features work as they are supposed to. Tests cover all scenarios.  ,1213096,-1,8060
The system works perfectly as intended.,1211966,-1,8060
The system works as intended.,1214055,-1,8060
The video explains the new functionality and the functionality is working as expected. all the scenarios are covered in the rspec test as well. Good job!,1213180,-1,8060
The write-up clearly mentions how to check/test the work done by the team. it includes almost everything the team has changed during their project.  It clearly mentions the filenames where the changes have been made. All the references are also included in the write-up  ,1213038,-1,8060
"Overall, it is well written.",1212940,-1,8060
The writeup has adequate screenshots to help understand the problem statement,1212499,-1,8060
Contains all the required explanation.,1212534,-1,8060
Very good. I go by what I said in the first review. It is very legible and I could understand what the project does and how the project does what it does.,1213097,-1,8060
"The team has provided an excellent write-up with proper explanation of the problem statement and the solutions they have provided. The team has also included  a video which make things really easy to understand. The team has shown navigation structure of the expertiza menu, which makes the workflow clear.",1211967,1,8060
The write-up was nicely written in the first round itself. It gives a clear idea of the project.,1214056,1,8060
The write-up is well written and organised. Everything looks fine. The team should have mentioned about the approach taken to solve the mentioned problem statement which will make the implementation easier to understand. Also the screenshots could be a little better.,1213181,1,8060
"yes, the code is ready to be deployed onto the server. this is a good starting place for future team to pick up.",1213039,-1,8060
"Looks fine. My biggest concern however is, which student's view opens here?  Add the feature of impersonation to this, and we get two identical views of student_task/list page: one with this particular feature, and the other, with impersonation feature. What is the difference between these views",1212941,-1,8060
"The code has mast elements ready but there can be more test cases generated with better test coverage. The code need not be rewritten from scratch, it just needs to include some more of the expected functionality",1212500,-1,8060
According to write-up and video yes but since I couldn't manually check I would say no.,1213147,-1,8060
the code looks fine. The only concern is related to the CI build which is failing at the moment. Some of the tests are failing because of the change. ,1213182,1,8060
the build fails and there is one warning and one error which needs to be fixed.,1213035,-1,8060
"There are build failures mentioned but I don't think the errors are due to this team's code, hence, giving them the benefit of doubt.",1212937,1,8060
"There were some build issues raised by Travis CI which have not been handled yet. However, there are no merge conflicts with the master branch.",1212496,-1,8060
No pull request link is provided ,1213143,-1,8060
Travis failed,1211447,-1,8060
No build did not pass. 1/3 checks very successful. It is fixable and the issues are trivial.,1213094,1,8060
The build in Travis CI failed. 3 out of the 4 build jobs had passed. The build job failed in the features folder. The branch did not have any conflicts with the main branch,1211964,1,8060
The CI build was failing in the previous submission as well in the new submission. The team should have corrected the same.,1213178,1,8060
The color scheme added during this project is working when tested through the UI.,1214286,-1,8109
"Yes, the changes work as expected in the UI. The test cases cover most of the scenarios. Would have been good if there was some scope for negative test cases that could be explained.",1213350,1,8109
"With the link provided, operation from UI are working as expected. No refactoring is required for the code change made.",1211769,-1,8109
"Yes, as per the scope of the project, all works beautifully well. Great job team.",1214027,-1,8109
"The added features work as expected, though the login info on the write-up didn't work for me.",1212631,1,8109
Works as intended.,1212099,-1,8109
I can't say about this since I tried to login with the credentials mentioned in their wiki(student5408/password) and I couldn't. However looking at their screenshots it seems that the UI looks good to go.,1213124,1,8109
Yes the color change is as per project. No new tests or re-factoring done as part of the project,1211477,-1,8109
"The write up is short and to the point, it could have been formatted and arranged in a better way.",1214287,1,8109
"The writeup is extremely well written. In the earlier round, I gave the team a suggestion to add the steps needed to check out their changes. They have added this part into the wiki now. Thank you and well done :)",1214028,-1,8109
Write up is written a neat and understandable with system screenshots and steps to test system manually.,1211770,-1,8109
The write up was well explained. Test cases were with images of test cases in the UI. The code could have a github screenshot or the link to the changed file for more clarity.,1213351,1,8109
The writing is good and completely covers the scope of the project.,1212632,-1,8109
These are my views on their writeup: 1.  Certain sections are too bold. I find that to be distracting.  2.  I like the way that they highlighted the lines of code that they have edited/modified. It made it easier to understand their work. 3. It was also good that they included references section at the end. It was something that I haven't seen in the other projects I have reviewed so far.,1213125,1,8109
Writeup is good. Explains everything they have done and how they have implemented.,1212100,-1,8109
"Again, the problem persists of containment of sentence.",1213806,1,8109
"No significant change from last round. But the writeup was good. Elaborative with screenshot of code and UI. It clearly mentioned the need for the change. But no approach mention but to be fair, the scope of the project doesnt call for it",1211478,-1,8109
Yes. The changes made are very basic and should not affect the functionality of the application in any away apart from the cosmetic changes made during the project.,1214288,-1,8109
Yes . Code seems ready to deploy. Also the approach taken is simple and very much acceptable.,1211771,-1,8109
"The code looks to be ready to be deployed on production, but would appreciate to have a few more tests run prior to it.",1213352,1,8109
I have no concerns regarding merging this into production.,1212633,-1,8109
"Although as per the scope of the project, the team did extremely well. All implementations as written in the project description were completed. However I feel that this project in general has more scope. Say introducing email notifications to the students when a review is due. As far as the work of the team is concerned, they completed everything that was asked of them.",1214029,1,8109
Build needs to be fixed. Then its ready for production.,1212101,1,8109
"Since, there are UI changes, they seem pretty improved",1213807,-1,8109
"No. This is not standards to add colors in the respective element. It becomes very hard to maintain or modify such changes in future. It would be better to move the style to a scss file and use a class-UI to make this change, which is clean and DRY",1211479,1,8109
I believe the code is the best that it can ever be and should be merged with the expertiza.,1213126,-1,8109
"There has been test failures, but not related to the project",1211475,1,8109
The build request passed.,1213122,-1,8109
"Well the build technically failed, but seeing as how that's practically impossible for this project, I'll give it a pass.",1212629,-1,8109
Build is failing probably because they have pushed changes few extra changes in schema.rb which I don't think is required for this project.,1212097,1,8109
"I am honestly unsure how to rate this. Earlier the build was passing. Now Travis CI cumulatively says the build failed, but when you look at the build history, Job#6150.3 failed, but Job#6150.4 passed.",1214025,1,8109
"Within the travis builds, the test folders of helpers, models and features are passing. The test folder for the controller seems to be failing for some reason.",1214284,1,8109
The code changes are accepted but build does not pass travis CI. The problem statement is simple and team has implemented a clean solution for the same.,1211767,1,8109
"The build has passed and the changes are also well explained in the wiki. As expected, the screenshots of the test cases are also displayed.",1213348,-1,8109
"No. I see there are some code was commented, which seems unnecessary, so just delete it.",1211493,1,8095
"In the wiki, I really appreciated seeing the appropriate build statements next to the unit tests. It helped connect what each test was testing in my mind.",1213887,1,8095
"Yes good write up but would have like to see details on model.  In test plan lines like "" two test cases for method "" are redundant. Can / should remove them ",1212346,1,8095
"Most are good, but the Test cases part just a combine of ""describe"" and ""it"" part of spec code. Could be replaced by a link of git.",1214294,1,8095
"the team has made great improvement as compared to the last submission. The new code added has no bad names, long or complicated functions but there is lack of comments. the heading of the write-up pages explains what the test case is doing but there should be proper commenting done in the code too.",1213148,1,8095
"Write-up includes everything the team has implemented. It clearly show the files which were involved to complete the project, background of the project and evrything. overall work done by the team is good but I feel that the test plan on the write-up page should be edited. The team should work on presenting their work to everyone in a good way.",1213153,1,8095
The code has been very well written and it follows all the coding practices. There could have been few more comments but other than that I don't see any other problem.,1213162,1,8095
The authors have made no changes since it was last reviewed.,1212760,1,8083
The Debug statements have not been removed.  Code Climate suggested Changes still are incomplete in the PR,1212788,1,8083
"The code segments in the report seem fine. The pull request and linked fork do not show the changes though, so I can't verify in the source code.",1211543,1,8083
"The code is written in a good manner, but as I see it from this submission no updates have been implemented. Including the absence of attaching a wiki page an unresolved error even from last time. So, its unclear to see what changes have been made from that date to this. ",1212914,1,8083
"Overall, the code is very well-written and follows all the best coding practices. But what I feel is a few more comments could help in improving the readability of the code. Also, there were few console debug statements which were causing the code-climate checks to fails. These could be removed or logged into Rails log.",1212732,1,8083
"The code changes are very less, so not much to say about refactoring, DRY problems etc. The code has ""put"" statements which are also pointed out by the code climate bot.Having put conditions is not a good coding style, the authors could have considered to remove the statements. puts ""hi, im in import""  puts name.to_s The authors could have debugged to see the flow of code, or remove them before committing.",1212893,1,8083
No New Commits,1212789,1,8083

"Nope, the last commit still shows from 12 days ago which is the time period even before the first submission. Overall, the branch is 3 commits ahead and 20 commits behind the Expertiza master. Even so, conclusively going by their git hub their last commit was before the first submission and hence, no commits in the second submission.",1212915,1,8083
The commits were done before the first deadline but unfortunately I don't see any commits during the second round or the pull request might not have been updated.,1212733,1,8083
No new commits after the first submission.,1212894,1,8083
No new Test cases,1212791,1,8083
Coverage decreased by .01%.,1211546,1,8083
"No, no visible test cases have been added and I even checked the files on their git repo for the same, but just like the first submission there is no change in the status quo of the project. As a matter of fact their overall coverage seems to have been decreased just as before which is still an unresolved cause of concern. ",1212917,1,8083
The team has changed a model and a html page. But there are no new test cases attached to the changes.,1212896,-1,8083
Writeup is still in the form of a word doc instead of a wiki. Test Plan and Tests are missing.,1212793,1,8083
"Their writeup is still the same doc file they had uploaded in the first submission. Now, while it was a good progress in resolving some of their errors in their first submission, clearly it is insufficient to be considered adequate for the second submission seeing as no changes have been made to it. ",1212919,1,8083
"Writeup clearly explains what their use cases are and what solution they came up with. There is a lack of background about it, how to test it from UI, test plan, test cases, DRY principle etc. Their write up is not on wiki, which makes it difficult to download the file every time and check it. Although it was pointed out during the first round, the team didn't change it , or they didn't update the wiki page which they created.",1212898,1,8083

However, it does prove to be a good starting point for a future team to pick from where these people have left off. ",1212920,1,8083
"Nope, they have errors in their build too as indicated by Travis CI and this is the error message output by it "" Hey @ppvasude, Something went wrong with the build. TravisCI finished with status errored, which means the build failed because of something unrelated to the tests, such as a problem with a dependency or the build process itself."" On checking the build logs I found that they errors in Bundle Install stage itself resulting from missing gems which they haven't resolved as a part of second submission.   ",1212916,1,8083

I think the project looks pretty close to be merge-ready and with a small amount of work on the coding styles and making sure all the PR checks pass the code can be deployed on the production server. It might however require some rigorous testing before getting merged.,1212738,1,8092

"I couldn't any new  commits in the second submission, though the functionality seemed to be fulfilled in the first round itself.",1213551,-1,8122
Yes the team has added test cases.,1214495,-1,8122
The team could have added more test cases as they have mentioned about refactoring the code. The refactored code and the screenshots of the test cases would have been better to display in the wiki for future students.,1213464,1,8122
The team has added tests and the coverage improved by a small percentage. More tests can be added to further improve coverage,1214173,1,8122
"Yes, the coverage has increased and has almost reached to 50%.",1212742,-1,8122
"This project is refactoring and there were not much of functionality changes, I see that teams have changed the existing tests make sure there is no coverage miss",1211602,-1,8122
test cases were not part of the requirement doc. Test plan added in the wiki. Could have added more negative test cases.,1212224,1,8122
"The test coverage seems to have increased slightly. Since this is a refactoring project, I wouldn't expect testing to be the focus, so that's pretty good even though the added test case most likely doesn't cover all the work done here.",1212189,-1,8122
"The team had added a test case in the last round, which I think was sufficient to test basic functionality.  There have been no additions to test cases in the second round.",1213899,-1,8122
"Team added several test cases, and the coverage was seen to increase",1213553,-1,8122
Yes the code addresses all issues.,1214496,-1,8122
"I feel that the project could cover more test cases which would have explained the functionality better. The sql that has been mentioned, could have no results as well, so covering negative results would have been better.",1213465,1,8122
Most of the functionalities that were required have been implemented but the final changes haven't been merged due to some build issues on Travis CI. The tests are quite comprehensive,1214174,-1,8122
"Yes, refactoring did not impact on the existing operation at all.",1211603,-1,8122
I can't really tell how to navigate to this portion of the project in the application. The writeup is not descriptive enough for me to know where to go to test it.,1212190,1,8122
The system operation works as intended.,1214111,-1,8122
"Yes, this is a refactoring project and the UI works as it is supposed to, after their code changes. All the functionalities seem to be intact. Good job there!",1213900,-1,8122
The system operation works as intended from the link provided.,1213554,-1,8122
The team has explained the issue and the solution they chose with enough   details to understand to way of implementation.,1214497,-1,8122
"I found the write up to be same. There is more scope to improve it with more explanation and test cases, specially the links to the refactored codes could be added for the other teams to know.",1213466,1,8122
"The writeup is clear and has illustrations to explain the flow. However, none of the code is added to the documentation. The project also only defines the test added but could add more details about the increase in coverage",1214175,1,8122
"The authors should have added screenshots for the changes made in the code. Otherwise, the purpose and work done has been explained well.",1212744,-1,8122
"overall it is well written, they can add reference section where they can put the link to the project etc.",1211604,-1,8122
"The writeup leaves me unable to really determine what was done to the point where I can examine the work in their application for correctness, especially since, as a refactor, the behavior should not have changed from the base expertiza application.",1212191,1,8122
The writeup is good overall. But it would have been better if more code snippets were added along with explanation of why certain methods are obsolete.,1214112,1,8122
The write-up is to the point and explains their approach neatly. The team has made efforts to update the write-up with the provided suggestions and it has improved the write-up.,1213901,-1,8122
"The writeup was elaborate, and fully elucidated the test added and the removed methods and SQL lines and their scope. ",1213555,-1,8122
Yes  I think with additional testing it can be deployed.,1214498,-1,8122
I feel there are more number of test cases that need to be covered before deploying this in PROD.,1213467,-1,8122
"The code is written in a modular way but there are some errors as shown by the CI. If these are fixed, it can be merged with the main project",1214176,1,8122
I strongly believe that this code is ready for production server,1211605,-1,8122
Changes are working perfectly.,1212227,-1,8122
"I think this code is ready to go, because it is better organized and structured than it used to be.",1212192,-1,8122
"I think that it is a neatly written code and once the integration issues have been resolved, it should be ready to be deployed on th production server.  The code being readable, can be easily picked up by the future team.",1213902,-1,8122
"The code build passes the travis CI test and it has not  conflicts with the base branch. However, the team should resolve warnings.",1214494,1,8122

"Most of the tests passed. However, a small fraction of the tests have failed and the code needs to be modified to incorporate these changes",1214172,1,8122
Travis CI test has been failed on Github.,1212741,-1,8122
build is passing on Travis CI. there are no pending conflicts,1211601,-1,8122
Few issues with the build but I feel they are trivial.,1212223,-1,8122
The pull request did not pass the automatic build requirements. It seems as though this team worked very hard to try to fix the build errors.,1212188,-1,8122
Ignoring this question since it is an OSS project.,1213898,-1,8122
"Though there were several build fails during the first round which seem to have been triggered on bundle exec, the final build passes in Travis CI",1213552,-1,8122
"The code was well written, DRY was not violated.",1213197,-1,8036
The code was well written. Although there were some problems with codeclimate identations. The team have made changes to fix those issues.,1214100,1,8036
"The code seems to be dry, and I had no issues with it in the 1st round.",1213938,-1,8036
It looks as good as round 1. ,1213931,-1,8036
"Naming looks good, they had already added comment to the code in the first review.",1212060,-1,8036
Don't see any DRY issues. Well Written Test code,1213557,-1,8036
The code is well written.  No suggestions.,1213758,-1,8036
"The code is structured well and is straightforward to follow. Test blocks are succinct and contain one assertion per block. The project has been greatly improved since the 1st round. Naming and indentation issues have been fixed. Furthermore, significant work has been done for the code to be consistent with Code Climate. One suggestion would be to elaborate on the #score method. Decomposition could be used to extract the common set up into a separate before(:each) block and test expectations using multiple 'it' statements as opposed to having everything asserted in one 'it' block.",1212137,1,8036
No there had been no bad names or wrong conventions used even in round 1. so no change there. The team has made few modifications to beautify the code by using ternary conditions which did make the code elegant. No new comments added.,1211494,-1,8036
Commits for Code Climate changes were pushed in.,1213198,-1,8036
"The team added new commits in the second round as well to improve their code style, improve codeclimate issues and changes other reviewer's suggested. Very few teams have done this. Great work.",1214101,-1,8036
Several commits were made to decrease the code climate warnings.,1213939,-1,8036
Yes. They are updating code to fix code climate issues. ,1213932,-1,8036
"Yes, there are new codes committed during the 2nd round.",1212282,-1,8036
Yes commits are done to fix the code climate issues.,1212363,-1,8036
"An unnecessary commit has been performed because  of which build has failed, and i think it wasn't required as already code had 100% coverage. You should check that out, it just an indentation issue i think. Format it using rubymine and push, it should work.  A shorter video to explain the work has been added as well. ",1212061,1,8036
I found many commits related to the code climate fixes.  No suggestions.,1213759,-1,8036
"No new commits with respect to code or functionality. Just few indentations,  comment changes and code beautifications done",1211495,1,8036
"The number of commits since the 1st round is impressive.  Significant improvements have been done pertaining to naming, indentation and overall Code Climate issues.",1212138,-1,8036
Test cases were added. Overall increase in the coverage range observed.,1213200,-1,8036
"Yes, the team added relevant test cases which increased the overall coverage.",1214103,-1,8036
"No unit tests were added during the resubmission, but they had an initially high coverage.",1213941,1,8036
"They achieve 100% during first round, so I don't think there are any new test need to be added. ",1213934,-1,8036
"Yes, they coverage is 100%.",1212284,-1,8036
Yes the project was about testing and coverage has increased.,1212365,-1,8036
100% coverage is achieved.,1212063,-1,8036
The coverall showed that the Overall coverage increased (+3.2%) to 39.999% The coverage of the participant.rb file is 100%. So great job team! No suggestions.,1213761,-1,8036
The code coverage was 100% in the 1st round.,1212140,-1,8036
YEs the project was a test project and the team has managed to achieve 100% coverage of the model. There was no increase in coverage from Round 1 to Round 2,1211497,-1,8036
The project works as intended. Test cases are showing a positive impact on the results.,1213201,-1,8036
"Yes, the tests cover all the scenarios one should check for. Great work !!!",1214104,-1,8036
"Edge cases are tested, and all scenarios for each method are tested. ",1213935,-1,8036
"Yes, they coverage is 100%.",1212285,-1,8036
Yes a lot of cases concerning a participant has been added.,1212366,-1,8036
"yes, 100% coverage has been achieved as shown in the video.",1212064,-1,8036
"When i try to run manually, i still see the same errors   Participant#email sends an email to the participant     Failure/Error: assignment = Assignment.find_by(id: self.assignment_id) Participant#score Get participant score within a round     Failure/Error: scores[questionnaire_symbol][:scores] = Answer.compute_scores(scores[questionnaire_symbol][:assessments], questions[questionnaire_symbol])",1213561,1,8036
The tests specified in the participant.rb file run perfectly well . The same has been demonstrated in the video mentioned above. No suggestions.,1213762,-1,8036
The code coverage is 100%. Every test case passes after a manual check.,1212141,-1,8036
"Yes, the test does covers 99% of the models variations. The team could have enhanced tests with varied inputs, such as for the handle method check. Even a more through test of the score method with different input data could have been done. ",1211498,1,8036
The writeup was significantly well written. Almost all the changes were covered.,1213202,-1,8036
The team has written their wiki page in a very detailed manner. They even added the video links which were missing in the first round as suggested. Thank you and good job :),1214105,-1,8036
Easily one of the most clearly documented projects I have reviewed in this class so far. I liked their organization of the Test Plan within the write-up.,1213943,-1,8036
"The wiki page provides clear details about the work, and very easy to understand. Just like round 1. ",1213936,-1,8036
"It is crisp and to the point, there are no clarity issues either.",1212367,-1,8036
"Well explained, all the test cases have been explained and are self explanatory as well.",1212065,-1,8036
Well Written,1213562,-1,8036
The writeup is really well written and has covered all the desired aspects along with the test plan. No suggestions.,1213763,-1,8036
The writeup clearly defines the primary objective of the project and justifies the reasoning behind introduction of additional helper constructs like participant factory. The authors complement the descriptions of each test case with associated block of code and elaborate on the details of their inner workings.,1212142,-1,8036
"The write-up and screen cast were both very explanatory. It included detailed code, the need for the test of partipant.rb and the use of the model. There was no change required from the initial write up.",1211499,-1,8036
The code is well organized and written & ready to be merged into the production server.,1213203,-1,8036
"Although I believe this project is ready to be merged into the branch, I would still like to make sure as to why their build is failing in Travis CI. Most likely it's not because of their own code, but as a suggestion the team should have also looked into this matter themselves, and explicitly stated somewhere in the wiki by getting clarification from the instructors.",1214106,1,8036
"I feel confident if the Travis CI integration issues are addressed, then it can be deployed in the production server.",1213944,1,8036
"as long as they fix 3 indentation issues for code climate, they are good to go. ",1213937,1,8036
"The test is almost ready to be deployed onto the production server. As mentioned above, there are some issues need to be fixed.",1212287,1,8036
The tests are good and it can be merged to the main line.,1212368,-1,8036
"The project is ready to be merged. The source code is clearly structured and can be used for the future team to work on. The project has 100% code coverage.  In order to avoid potential problems of using AssignmentParticipant instance, participantSuper object is defined in factories.rb, which is an instance of Participant class. The possible suggestions are to deconstruct #scores method and introduce 'context' constructs to enhance code documentation.",1212143,1,8036
"It's a test project, so not applicable for production deployment. But the code can be merged as appropriate test for participant model. Any future teams can enhance the test with varied input scenarios.",1211500,1,8036
Conflicts were resolved to an extent for the Travis Cl. But not all the tests are passing.,1213199,1,8036
"Unfortunately, the build failed in the second round. But, in my opinion this was not due to the team's mistake. The build failure says the two examples failed are in files ""assignment_spec.rb"" and ""assignment_participant_spec.rb"", both files which the team had no connection with. I could be wrong though. As the build was passing and there tests were running in the first round, I am inclined to believe it was because of another team's incorrect code that this team pulled into their branch by mistake.",1214102,1,8036
"The pull request says the Travis CI build is in progress, but that seems improbable. Upon closer investigation into the Travis CI ""details"", it looks like the build is failing.",1213940,1,8036
"It is pending while I am doing this review. When I click on it, it did not pass Travis CI, but it fails on tests on features, while this group is testing participant, it happened to our group as well, I assume it is not an issue with their code.",1213933,1,8036
The Travis CI is in progress and there are 3 codeclimate issue to fix.  ,1212283,1,8036
"Some travis ci tests have failed and some code climate issues are still pending, though the commit comments say that the issues aren't related to the project files. But they have tried to fix the issues though so good work.",1212364,1,8036
"A commit has been performed 4 days back , which isn't making any change to the code just the indentation, and since then build hasn't passed. You should check that out, it just an indentation issue i think. Format it using rubymine and push, it should work.",1212062,1,8036
"TRAVIS CI didn't Pass, but team have fixed most of CODE Climate issues",1213559,1,8036
"The Travis CI build did not fail exactly but it did not pass either. It showed in progress. But when I clicked on the details, it showed that the test failed.  Suggestion: Travis CI issue should have been rectified.",1213760,1,8036
The previous builds of this project did not pass Travis CI. The current build status is pending.,1212139,1,8036
The pull request has failed but doesnt look like its related to the team's commit. there is already an existing issue present.,1211496,1,8036
The code seemed to be well written in the first round. But I dont see changes done in round 2. The github link provided shows last commit for Oct 21. Though I see that there are change made in the wiki which were required and are done well.,1213169,1,8091
Seems at par with the coding standards,1212450,1,8091
"In the first round, which files were related to what issue was not mentioned. However, now they have edited the wiki to reflect the mentioned changes. Each file and its related functionality has been mentioned. Appreciated!",1212299,1,8091
There is no change in the code in this round. The variable names and method names are intuitive. The code is well indented; some useful comments can be included to improve readability. The code is DRY.,1212900,1,8091
"Did not find problems in the code in the first round. Follows ruby style guide, commented and good naming. Very well written.",1213339,-1,8091
"The team has implemented proper functions and has used a proper naming convention. However, there is scope to add some comments. For ex: in the new method - get_feedback_assessments_for method which will return a feedback assessment, the team could have added some comments about the logic implemented. Apart from this, the code is concise and good coding and Ruby practices have been followed",1212004,1,8091
The code is well-written with proper comments. But none of the suggestions from the previous review has been implemented. Teams are provided reviews so that they can further improve upon the code.,1214240,1,8091
"The last commit was 21 days ago, so I fear that that there are no commits being made in round 2. Could have done a commit in round two just to confirm that there were no changes required in round 2, so that the reviewer may be certain about it.",1213170,-1,8091
Last commit seems to be 11 days ago,1212452,1,8091
No new commits have been made. All changes are in the documentation only.,1212300,1,8091
"I don't see any new commits for round 2, mostly nothing was needed",1211460,-1,8091
No new commits.,1213340,-1,8091
"Unfortunately, there was no new commit added. The latest commit is 10 days ago",1212005,1,8091
"Yes, the team has added test cases, the code for a couple of test cases are in the wiki in a separate section. Again, it would have been better to explain the test cases a little more, may be using screenshots of successful test cases.",1213172,1,8091
No new test were added but earlier tests are working.,1212456,1,8091
The team has added test cases but the code coverage has decreased by 0.04%. The newly added tests cover almost all the new functionality implemented. The new test cases are pretty diverse.,1212302,1,8091
The team has added test cases but the overall coverage has reduced by 0.04%,1211462,1,8091
The team has added test cases: 1. To check that if there is no rejoinder for the review then it redirects to new author feedback page. 2. To check that the other teammate is able to edit. 3. To check if the page is redirecting back to review. 4. To check if the rejoinder by a participant of a team is saved properly.  The overall coverage decreased from 48% to 47.601%. It decreased by 0.04%,1212903,-1,8091
The team have added the test cases which covers the range of the project. Coverage increased.,1213342,1,8091
"The team has written new test cases, but the overall test case coverage has decreased by 0.04%. The tests cover the range of this project.",1214243,1,8091
The coverage has decreased by 0.04%. The team has added some tests which were not present in the initial submission. 44.9% of the changed lines are covered,1212007,-1,8091
The system works as intended however the flow for system given in the wiki is quite confusing. The test cases were edited to cover all scenarios.,1212303,1,8091
Everything is working,1212458,-1,8091
"The system operation from UI works as expected by the project. I was able to verify that the rejoinder is given by the team instead of team member. The rejoinder is also made easily available to the user, by providing easy navigation options to give feedback to reviewers, hence making the UI more user friendly. The Author feedback section contains the team's collective feedback to reviewers of particular assignments. Most of the task is to refactor code so that it complies with the new requirement of team rejoinders, and the features work as expected.",1212904,1,8091
Works as intended. Could have elaborated a little more like a guidance in wiki.  Was able to test the features. Works fine.,1213343,1,8091
The projects works as intended. Some of the issues in the problem statement covers refactoring which has been properly handled by the team.,1212008,1,8091
The team has not provided steps for manual testing even though this was requested during round 1 review.,1214244,-1,8091
"The authors have added the screenshots from github which clearly shows the code change. But since there are many changes, the explanation in the wiki is small. A better way would have been to put the links to the git files where the changes are made and there could be more explanations instead. This would also reduce the size of the wiki.",1213174,1,8091
They should have included screenshots associated with the issue. it would help one understand the solution better,1212460,1,8091
Dissatisfied with the write up because no clear explanation has been given for how they arrived at the design. At some places the documentation abruptly stops mid-explanation. The code screenshots and the accompanying explanation is good.,1212304,1,8091
Nicely written wiki. ,1211464,-1,8091
"The write up is simple and understandable. It starts off by describing about Expertiza, motivation behind the project, the tasks to do, list of classes that are modified and impacted by the change. I like how the authors have screenshots of both the existing code that is removed and the new code that is added in the pull request, which juxtaposes them and highlights the tasks in the problem statement and goals of the project. The write up then ends with the test plan which lists the test cases handled.",1212905,1,8091
Could have been more elaborate how to check the work. No mention of design principles or patterns used. ,1213344,1,8091
"The write-up lacks screenshots/ relevant images/ screencast to explain the workflow of the project. This would increase the readability of the wikipage. Also, the team has added testplan and included description for the code presented in the wiki. These points were mentioned during the previous review which were picked up by the team. The team has done a good work in improving their writeup as compared to the previous version.",1212009,1,8091
"There has been some improvement in the content of the write-up, but not all suggestions have been incorporated. Adding more screenshots of the functionality, or a video of the project being explained will always be helpful.",1214245,1,8091
A better explanation on the test cases would have made sure that the code is ready. I feel that some more tests need to be done before deploying the code.,1213175,1,8091
The code is ready to be deployed on production server with few caveats. At some places values and logic is hardcoded. This project would be a really good starting point for further work.,1212305,1,8091
I think the code can be merged. All the test cases seem to cover the edge cases and my testing shows that the things function as expected.,1211465,-1,8091
"The code is functionally ready to be deployed in the production server, because it is sound and even passes the build of Travis CI. There are a few minor issues due to Cognitive Complexity of names of methods, lines of code and a few indentation errors. If they are fixed, the code is complete and will pass the build of codeclimate as well. The team has proceeded in the correct approach and there is no need for the project to be redone from scratch using a different approach.",1212906,1,8091
Yes it is ready to be deployed.,1213345,-1,8091
"The team has covered the implementation of the points given in the problem statement. However, testing of the project is necessary. This is one of the point which cold be worked on by the future team. According to codeclimate, there are 7 issues which need to be fixed as well. The future team could improve on those points.",1212010,1,8091
"From the file diff in GitHub, it looks the code is in good shape. There were a few suggestions provided during round 1 review. If those could also be integrated, it would be better. The test cases are successfully running. But the functionality could not be tested due to lack for steps in the wiki. ",1214246,1,8091
"The build seems to pass, but it would have been great if the test cases were explained better. Maybe some screenshots or a video would have been easier to test.",1213171,1,8091
Yes travis CI is passing. Code climate has few issues but they can be easily resolved.,1212454,1,8091
"The Travis CI build passed , the code does not have any conflicts with the master. Initially (stage 1) a lot of changes were made so that the Travis CI build would pass. Kudos for effort!",1212301,1,8091
Travis CI says tests have failed but these don't include the tests written by the team.,1211461,-1,8091
The code has passed the Travis CI build has passed. The danger build has also passed with one warning because of more that 500 Lines of Code. On the other hand the codeclimate build has failed with 7 issues to fix.  1. There is a method get_feedback_assessments_for which has a Cognitive Complexity of 9 (which exceeds 5) and must be refactored. 2. The model class Team contains 21 methods (which is more than the 20 allowed) and hence has to be refactored. 3. The method view_heatgrid has 28 Lines of code that exceeds the allowed 20 and hence has to be refactored. 4. The method set_content has a Cognitive Complexity of 6 (which exceeds the allowed 5) and hence has to be refactored 5. Presence of an unescaped model attribute in the file app/views/response/view.html.erb 6. Assignment Branch condition size for get_feedback_assessments_for is too high 7. Indentation issues in app/models/assignment_participant.rb There are no conflicts with the base branch.,1212902,1,8091
Build passed. codeclimate - 7 issues to fix. 2/3 checks were passed. Issues seem trivial.,1213341,-1,8091
The build has passed and there have not been any conflicts.,1212006,1,8091
The CI build has passed and there are no conflicts.,1214242,-1,8091
"Yes, the Travis build is passing.",1212413,-1,8034
No the code did not pass Travis CI tests. there was an issue with generate_team_name which could be fixed.,1212881,1,8034
"Yes, the pull request has passed the Travis CI build test and does not contain any conflict with the base branch.",1213714,-1,8034
There are no conflicts,1213707,-1,8034
Build pass was failed in Travis CI.,1212965,1,8034
No. The test failed.,1212811,1,8034
The travis builds on both pull request have passed.,1214249,-1,8034
"Yes, the build passes Travis CI",1212545,-1,8034
"Yes, the code changes are simple and to the point. I don't see any other way it could be done. ",1212549,-1,8034
The user name issue seems to not have been resolved when tested manually. The code may be deployable and would not cause a problem since there are not many complicated changes.,1214253,1,8034
I think work is still needed on this project. All test cases are not able to pass so.,1212815,1,8034
I did not understand why is it necessary to prohibit spaces in usernames. I believe the code could have been modified to work with spaces as well,1212969,1,8034
"Yes, the changes have passed all the checks and can be deployed in production. ",1213718,-1,8034
Excellent work,1211757,-1,8034
"The code looks good and it could be deployed onto the production server. However, there could be a situation where even though a random num(0-1000) is assigned to each team there might be a chance that two teams get the same name.",1212885,1,8034
In good state.,1212417,-1,8034
The writeup is great. I was able to understand the issue and do manual testing.,1212548,-1,8034
The write up has most of the relevant information. The formatting could have been better. I would suggest the team to use a standard dimension for the screenshots they have added.,1214252,1,8034
It was very well-written and self explanatory.,1212814,-1,8034
The wiki page has been written concisely. The team has used screenshots which ease the understanding of the work they've done. ,1213717,-1,8034
The write-up clearly explains the issues faced and the code fixes used to solve them.,1212884,-1,8034
Comprehensive.,1212416,-1,8034
I followed the steps as mentioned in the wiki and it works as expected.,1212547,-1,8034
"The user name issue does not seem to have been resolved. Although the code added seems adequate, I was able to create a username with spaces in the string.",1214251,1,8034
Yes Everything works perfectly fine.,1212813,-1,8034
Works properly,1213709,-1,8034
"Yes, the UI changes according to the specified conditions. After logging in as a student, we can see the team name being displayed at the top of the page.",1213716,-1,8034
The features for the issues fixed work as intended.,1212883,-1,8034
Everything looks fine to me.,1212415,-1,8034
The team did add test cases covering the functionality. The overall coverage increased by 0.004% to 47.652%.,1212546,-1,8034
The team have added adequate tests.,1214250,-1,8034
"Yes, they did add the test cases and the coverage increased to 80%",1212812,-1,8034
coverage is same ,1212966,-1,8034
"Yes, it increases the coverage too",1213708,-1,8034
"The team has modified an existing test case, but it didn't increase the test coverage.",1213715,1,8034
"The team added test cases in the spec file for both the issues. Further, a detailed explaination is given using screenshots for manual testing if necessary. The coverage increased for 1 issue while it remained the same for the other.",1212882,1,8034
Changes are covered with new test cases.,1212414,-1,8034
No new changes were committed during the second round.,1212544,1,8034
No new commits were made during the second round.,1214248,1,8034
No. They were no commits during round 2.,1212810,1,8034
No new commits,1212964,-1,8034
"Yes, there are few commits after round 1",1213706,-1,8034
"No, the team hasn't committed any changes during the second round. The last commit was on 31st October 2018.",1213713,1,8034
No there were no commits made after Oct 31st.,1212880,-1,8034
The code has been written as per the coding standard. The code written by the team adheres to dry principle.,1214506,-1,8034
"The code is written aptly and it does what it is supposed to do. However, code comments are missing.",1212543,1,8034
The code added during this project adheres DRY principles. ,1214247,-1,8034
The code was written at it's best,1212809,-1,8034
"Yes, the code is well written.",1212963,-1,8034
"Yes, code is well written",1213705,-1,8034
The team has followed rails best practices while writing the code. ,1213712,-1,8034
"The code was well written and there was no issue with the naming or functions used. However, a few comments could be added to the current_team,new_team and team to make the code more readable.",1212879,1,8034
All coding principles are followed. //Add more comments.,1212411,1,8034
A lot of outdated approaches were used. Refactoring was needed.,1213318,1,8120
Code is very neat and readable. I appreciate you attention to following good syntax practices. There is some similar code was exists in the controller action method and the content page method but simple to bring out and make dry. Overall great job.,1214177,1,8120
The code was written pretty well.,1211501,-1,8120
"The code is well written with proper naming conventions and proper size of functions. However, i would only suggest that they should include proper comments so that it increases the readability of the code.",1212501,1,8120
"The code is well-structured, the team uses context and it properly to separate different cases and using each to make the code DRY. However, it seems the object used to test are not all stored in the factories file properly.",1212928,1,8120
No commits needed after first review.,1213086,-1,8120
The last commit was listed as 12 days prior to this review. But the code looks to be in great shape so there was no need for new additions.,1214178,-1,8120
No new commits. No new bug fixed.,1211502,-1,8120
 The last commit was 12 days ago. I believe that this team had finished their work well before round 1 itself. I think they had planned the work well in advance and followed that plan as well.,1212831,-1,8120
There were really few commits in the 2nd round. The only commit I could see was on 30th October. The only suggestion I would give is to continuously update their work on git. ,1212502,-1,8120
There is no new commit during the 2nd round.,1212929,-1,8120
"No new test cases added, but the existing ones had a good coverage too.",1213088,1,8120
Overall test coverage  was decreased by 35%.,1213321,1,8120
No need for adding new test cases as the previous submission already achieved 100% coverage. I apologize for not being certain how to accurately answer this question.,1214180,-1,8120
"They didn't add test cases, but the test coverage is always above 90%.",1211504,-1,8120
There are no new tests and that is because the team had already completed their work before deadline 1 and the coverage was 100% on the deadline one itself so there is basically no scope for improvement for this team.,1212833,-1,8120
"The team did add test cases. They achieved a little more than the desired coverage even , that means they have done a great work.",1212504,-1,8120
The team added test cases for menu.rb and the coverage increases but the overall coverage seems decrease due to that.,1212931,1,8120
"From the video, the functionality works well.",1213322,-1,8120
N/A. This is a unit test project.,1211505,-1,8120
"Yes, the tests cover all the scenarios.",1211980,-1,8120
The tests cover most of the scenarios as is evident from their mutant killing capabilities. ,1212834,-1,8120
The team was asked to write test cases and get a coverage of around 90%. The team did a really good job in writing test cases for all the methods present in the assigned files.,1212505,-1,8120
The project has a good coverage of the codes ,1212932,-1,8120
The writeup is well documented,1213323,-1,8120
The write up is very informative and clearly shows the impact and result of the project tests. It would have been a great addition to have included more discussion on the design choices of your testcases and how it was implemented. Overall a great wiki.,1214182,-1,8120
The writeup is pretty good and easy to follow.,1211506,-1,8120
I loved the write-up. Write from the beginning to explaining Expertiza to explaining their task and the test plan which was very detailed and methodical. I also like that they had included a screen shot of the Mutant test which shows the thoroughness of their tests. Overall an impressive job by the authors.,1212835,-1,8120
The writeup is well written and clearly tells the flow and method of working. It shows clearly what all work is done and how it is done. It mentions specifically the explanation of each functionality and how it is checked.,1212506,-1,8120
"The writeup gives an easy-understanding introduction of the two classes the team needed to test. Also, there is detailed test plan is provided. The wiki also shows how the test cases are designed and the results. However, for the motivation part, it is a little bit general, which needs to add more things specific for this project.",1212933,1,8120
a Lot of refactoring is required before the code goes on to production server.,1213324,1,8120
Not ready. There are still a few errors in Travis CI and code climate.,1211507,1,8120
"As mentioned above, they can make it better by fixing some issues.",1211982,-1,8120
The travis test had failed and codeclimate shows indentation and other such minor errors. I think that the team just needs to work on the styling and following some Ruby guidelines and they are good to go.,1212836,1,8120
"The project is almost on the stage that it can be deployed on the production server. However, there are few test cases that are failing as shown on the git. If these minor flaws are fixed then the code is good to go.",1212507,-1,8120
The team gives a good guidelines for how to test and what to test for the two classes.,1212934,-1,8120
Travis CI failed.,1213087,1,8120
The travis CI build failed.,1213320,1,8120
"There is a minor code climate error as mentioned above, similar code. An easy fix and you will be green with the climate check.",1214179,1,8120
The build didn't pass in Travis CI. There is still an error.,1211503,1,8120
"They did a good job and they can make it better by fixing some issues . According to the pull request page, the Travis CI build failed and there are 5 code climate issues to fix",1211978,1,8120
The pull request is the same as the previous one. And as in the case of the previous one it fails.,1212832,1,8120
"The code passes almost all Travis CI . However, there are really few which fail.",1212503,1,8120
The code is well written. I did not see any bad naming conventions or bad coding style.  ,1212508,-1,8079
No need for test cases. (+1 for mentioning it in the Wiki!),1212777,-1,8079
No test cases present but test plan covers it.,1212316,-1,8079
Not required,1211455,-1,8079
Test cases were not required for this project.,1213130,-1,8079
The test cases were required as the chnages were related to UI. The team mentioned the same in the wiki.,1213471,-1,8079
"yes, the ui operations works as intended.the features fixed now works as intended.",1213229,-1,8079
It's working.,1212317,-1,8079
Since the project was deployed hence manual testing could not be done but the screenshots show that the project works as intended.,1214090,1,8079
The feature works as per the video shown.,1212666,-1,8079
Fro video it seems to work as intended.,1212092,-1,8079
the video explains the new functionality and the functionality is working as expected. Good job!,1213472,-1,8079
"Yes, it works as expected.",1212512,-1,8079
Writeup has been improved after the first review. The codes now look more comprehensive.,1212779,-1,8079
Writeup is good and understandable. Test plan is written well indicating the steps clearly in what needs to be done to test.,1212318,-1,8079
"The deployed link application again goes to video only, if deployment isn't done they could've removed the link.",1212667,1,8079
"In my opinion, the project is ready to be deployed and does not need to adopt a different approach.",1214092,-1,8079
"The deployed application was not available, so it cannot be accurately predicted if the code functions as intended. However the vedio links in the google drive show that the issues have been resolved through existing code. ",1213133,1,8079
"The number of commits since the 1st round is impressive.  Significant improvements have been done pertaining to naming, indentation and overall Code Climate issues.",1212138,-1,8108
The previous builds of this project did not pass Travis CI. The current build status is pending.,1212139,1,8108
The code coverage was 100% in the 1st round.,1212140,-1,8108
The code coverage is 100%. Every test case passes after a manual check.,1212141,1,8108
The writeup clearly defines the primary objective of the project and justifies the reasoning behind introduction of additional helper constructs like participant factory. The authors complement the descriptions of each test case with associated block of code and elaborate on the details of their inner workings.,1212142,-1,8108
"The project is ready to be merged. The source code is clearly structured and can be used for the future team to work on. The project has 100% code coverage.  In order to avoid potential problems of using AssignmentParticipant instance, participantSuper object is defined in factories.rb, which is an instance of Participant class. The possible suggestions are to deconstruct #scores method and introduce 'context' constructs to enhance code documentation.",1212143,1,8108
Yes commits are done to fix the code climate issues.,1212363,-1,8108
"Some travis ci tests have failed and some code climate issues are still pending, though the commit comments say that the issues aren't related to the project files. But they have tried to fix the issues though so good work.",1212364,1,8108
Yes the project was about testing and coverage has increased.,1212365,-1,8108
Yes a lot of cases concerning a participant has been added.,1212366,-1,8108
"It is crisp and to the point, there are no clarity issues either.",1212367,-1,8108
The tests are good and it can be merged to the main line.,1212368,-1,8108
Don't see any DRY issues. Well Written Test code,1213557,-1,8108
"TRAVIS CI didn't Pass, but team have fixed most of CODE Climate issues",1213559,1,8108
The code is well written. The variable and method names look clean and concise. The functions are small and well defined,1213486,-1,8044
"When i try to run manually, i still see the same errors   Participant#email sends an email to the participant     Failure/Error: assignment = Assignment.find_by(id: self.assignment_id) Participant#score Get participant score within a round     Failure/Error: scores[questionnaire_symbol][:scores] = Answer.compute_scores(scores[questionnaire_symbol][:assessments], questions[questionnaire_symbol])",1213561,1,8108
Well Written,1213562,-1,8108
2 of the methods are resulting in Errors,1213563,1,8108
"The code is well commented, I did not see any bad naming conventions or bad coding style",1211878,-1,8044

"The code seems to follow good Ruby on Rails Coding practices. The implemented code is DRY. They could have increased commenting  by making comments more descriptive.  The comments for say a particular function could have included  the input arguments, their data types and the return value and its data type if any. For the second round they haven't added any new commits and haven't changed their implementation.",1213889,1,8044
"Yes, the code is written really well.",1213504,1,8044
"Naming looks good, they had already added comment to the code in the first review.",1212060,-1,8108
"The code seems clear and dry. However, a few comments would have made the code more readable.",1213543,1,8044
"An unnecessary commit has been performed because  of which build has failed, and i think it wasn't required as already code had 100% coverage. You should check that out, it just an indentation issue i think. Format it using rubymine and push, it should work.  A shorter video to explain the work has been added as well. ",1212061,1,8108
The code was already well-written . No changes were suggested in the first round. The team did a great work in following coding best practices.,1213304,-1,8044
Code has no problem.,1212263,-1,8044
"A commit has been performed 4 days back , which isn't making any change to the code just the indentation, and since then build hasn't passed. You should check that out, it just an indentation issue i think. Format it using rubymine and push, it should work.",1212062,1,8108
No new commits are added in this round.,1213487,1,8044
100% coverage is achieved.,1212063,-1,8108

The code is well organized and written & ready to be merged into the production server.,1213203,-1,8108
It looks as good as round 1. ,1213931,-1,8108
Yes. They are updating code to fix code climate issues. ,1213932,-1,8108
"It is pending while I am doing this review. When I click on it, it did not pass Travis CI, but it fails on tests on features, while this group is testing participant, it happened to our group as well, I assume it is not an issue with their code.",1213933,1,8108
"They achieve 100% during first round, so I don't think there are any new test need to be added. ",1213934,-1,8108

"as long as they fix 3 indentation issues for code climate, they are good to go. ",1213937,1,8108
The code was well written. Although there were some problems with codeclimate identations. The team have made changes to fix those issues.,1214100,1,8108
"The team added new commits in the second round as well to improve their code style, improve codeclimate issues and changes other reviewer's suggested. Very few teams have done this. Great work.",1214101,-1,8108
"Unfortunately, the build failed in the second round. But, in my opinion this was not due to the team's mistake. The build failure says the two examples failed are in files ""assignment_spec.rb"" and ""assignment_participant_spec.rb"", both files which the team had no connection with. I could be wrong though. As the build was passing and there tests were running in the first round, I am inclined to believe it was because of another team's incorrect code that this team pulled into their branch by mistake.",1214102,1,8108
"Yes, the team added relevant test cases which increased the overall coverage.",1214103,-1,8108
The team has written their wiki page in a very detailed manner. They even added the video links which were missing in the first round as suggested. Thank you and good job :),1214105,-1,8108
There were no such commits during round 1. All are done in round 2,1213505,-1,8044

No new commit.,1212264,1,8044
The coverage has actually decreased.,1213489,1,8044
"As I explained in my first review, the test plan is well written and all of these are tested manually there are no separate automated cases written.",1211881,-1,8044
"Although I believe this project is ready to be merged into the branch, I would still like to make sure as to why their build is failing in Travis CI. Most likely it's not because of their own code, but as a suggestion the team should have also looked into this matter themselves, and explicitly stated somewhere in the wiki by getting clarification from the instructors.",1214106,1,8108
The team did add test cases covering the functionality. The overall coverage increased  by +6.6% to 43.356%.,1212042,-1,8044
"The team has included a thorough testing plan but I couldn't find any commits to any of the rspec testing controllers. They could have added as per there test plan. These tests could have been included 1) Login as Instructor4. Add a new assignment Assignment_Instructor4 under the course Course 617, Spring 2016. 2) Make student6400 as the participant of that assignment and logout. using Capybara and Cucumber.",1213892,1,8044
"Yes, team has written test cases in a proper manner which increases the coverage also",1213507,-1,8044
"The code seems to be dry, and I had no issues with it in the 1st round.",1213938,-1,8108
The team did not add an automated test plan. But manual testing was clearly demonstrated using screenshots.,1213546,-1,8044
Several commits were made to decrease the code climate warnings.,1213939,-1,8108
"They did not post their test cases coverage, so I don't know whether their coverage increase or not.",1212266,1,8044
"The pull request says the Travis CI build is in progress, but that seems improbable. Upon closer investigation into the Travis CI ""details"", it looks like the build is failing.",1213940,1,8108
"No, there have been no new additions to the test cases since last round of review. The code coverage still remains the same as before, with an increase of 6.6%.",1213592,-1,8044
"No unit tests were added during the resubmission, but they had an initially high coverage.",1213941,-1,8108
Everything is good here!,1213942,-1,8108
"Although the test coverage is increased according to github, i could not find any new test cases in the project. The team has not added any test case for the correction.",1213307,1,8044
Easily one of the most clearly documented projects I have reviewed in this class so far. I liked their organization of the Test Plan within the write-up.,1213943,-1,8108
"I feel confident if the Travis CI integration issues are addressed, then it can be deployed in the production server.",1213944,1,8108

I found many commits related to the code climate fixes.  No suggestions.,1213759,-1,8108
"The Travis CI build did not fail exactly but it did not pass either. It showed in progress. But when I clicked on the details, it showed that the test failed.  Suggestion: Travis CI issue should have been rectified.",1213760,1,8108
The coverall showed that the Overall coverage increased (+3.2%) to 39.999% The coverage of the participant.rb file is 100%. So great job team! No suggestions.,1213761,-1,8108
The tests specified in the participant.rb file run perfectly well . The same has been demonstrated in the video mentioned above. No suggestions.,1213762,-1,8108
The writeup is really well written and has covered all the desired aspects along with the test plan. No suggestions.,1213763,-1,8108
The code can definitely be deployed but once the 3 pending code climate issues(I believe the 3 are to be resolved by he mentor) and the Travis CI build have been rectified. Suggestion: Rectify the Travis CI issues.,1213764,1,8108

"Coverage went up by 8.4%, according to coveralls.",1211560,-1,8074
"Only 34% of the lines of code in review_response_map.rb were covered, according to their video. This is much lower than the 90% required by the project descriptions.",1211561,1,8074
The writeup was still on wikipedia and didn't expand on the reasons why the test cases were the way they are. No justification was provided for why only 34% of the LoC in the model was covered.,1211562,1,8074
"34% is better than nothing, but it's still a far-cry from a complete unit test suite for the review_response_map model. I'd recommend it be merged, but it needs to be completed.",1211563,1,8074
Variable names and test cases are named appropriately. Explanation of reasons for the style of code and problem solving approach is lacking.,1214499,1,8074

the test examples they showed are good. ,1211947,-1,8074
No new commits have been made in the 2nd round,1213247,1,8074
The build is passing successfully,1213248,-1,8074
"Yes since it was a unit test assignment, tests have been added and overall coverage has increased",1213249,-1,8074
"The tests cover all the scenarios. Given that the problem statement is pretty open-ended, the changes fulfil the purpose.",1213250,-1,8074
"Although the write up clearly explains the problem statement and also contains the changes made, it doesn't include the test plan which would give a clearer picture of the changes added.",1213251,1,8074
"Since it is a unit test project with well-written tests, I don't see any issues why it can't be deployed to production",1213252,1,8074

"The reason to give 3 is that there are certain simple code climate issues regarding spaces, indentation and so. These are easy to fix and are related to code quality.",1212867,1,8074
Overall coverage was increased by 8+ percentage. ,1212868,-1,8074
"The document straight away starts with the explanation of the project specifics without any background as to what was the whole purpose of doing this. Problem statement is very general, it could have been more specific as to what was the drawbacks of the existing implementation and how that can be resolved with the new changes. The doc also lacks a test plan.  It is preferable for the doc to be written in expertiza wiki rather than the normal wiki. ",1212870,1,8074
The biggest concern are the simple code climate issues.,1212871,1,8074
 It's fine to good. I wish y'all would have posted a link to your repo in stead of the pull request.,1213917,1,8074
 No new code was committed during the 2nd round of resubmission.,1213918,1,8074
" The project does not pass the Travis CI integration tests. I looked at its output, and I cannot tell how significant the failure is. Maybe its an easy fix?",1213919,1,8074
 They added all the test cases! There is so much coverage now!,1213920,-1,8074
"I think it covers all of the scenarios, but don't quote me. I don't have a great understanding of review response map.",1213921,-1,8074
"Y'all did the least possible work, AND put it on wikipedia instead of the expertiza wiki.",1213922,1,8074

"Yes, It works .",1214202,-1,8074
"No, it is not good at all, they didn't explain the functionality of their test code.",1214203,1,8074
"No, they code is not complete, and many cases are not covered.",1214204,1,8074
The code was well written even in the first round.,1213246,-1,8074
UI is working correctly there are no features broken ,1211882,-1,8044
Cannot be verified since no deployment is provided.,1213490,1,8044
"Since, the  project was not deployed hence manual testing could not be performed. But, the screencasts show that the system works as intended.",1212043,1,8044
The bug fixing does work according to the screenshots provided by the authors. They have provided a step by step screenshot of the issue that they have fixed. The authors haven't hosted their version of the expertiza so it is very difficult to actually check the functionality. They could have hosted expertiza on VCL or they could have put a screen cast of the working functionality to help in reviewing.,1213893,1,8044
"Yes, It works perfectly fine. Also, the screencast they uploaded, makes it more easy and convenient for me to understand the portion of changes implemented.",1213508,-1,8044
"The link to the deployed application was not available, so the project could not be tested.",1213547,1,8044
The video explains the new functionality and the functionality is working as expected. Good job!,1213308,-1,8044
"Yes, both the the issues seem to be fixed from the screencast video. It clearly explains the before and after scenarios and the system works as expected.  The test plan is still missing for the fixed issues.",1213593,1,8044
"They did not provide a link for me to test, but their video shows that their code works well.",1212267,1,8044
The write up clearly captures the functionality that the work is related to.,1213491,-1,8044
well written document my suggestion is put the cropped version of images or even links to images is also fine. ,1211883,-1,8044
The write up is well written and self explanatory.  It would have been better if the screenshots were of standard size but that is not a problem since the purpose of the document is just to explain the project.,1212044,-1,8044
The authors have documented the steps they did to solve the issues in a clean manner. Although they haven't mentioned any particular design principles or design thinking that went on in solving the issues. They have explained all the functionalities of each file they have modified and stated why they have modified the particular file. One thing they could have added were class diagrams and dependency maps. Or some pictorial representation of the flow of each task which will help the reviewers and instructors to quickly catch up on their idea. It doesn't seem like the authors have updated their writeups since the last submission.,1213894,-1,8044
Very well written and elaborated.,1213509,-1,8044
The write-up was good and clearly explains the issues faced and the code changed. It would have been much more clear if screenshots of git file changed were posted. ,1213548,1,8044
The write-up is well written and organised. Everything looks fine. Great work with the write up!  ,1213309,-1,8044
The write-up has been improvised by the authors and they have added the reasoning for the approach they chose. This increases the understanding of their solution.  They have also modified their test plan steps.,1213594,-1,8044
"Since the code coverage has decreased, I don't think this code should be deployed on production. However, it is a good starting place for a new team to pickup.",1213492,-1,8044
this code is ready for server,1211884,-1,8044
"Yes, I think the project is ready to be deployed at the production server since all the required functionalities are implemented.",1212045,-1,8044
I think the authors have done a good job in fixing the issues but they should have added tests to check if their code does handle all the possible edge cases and does not break any other code functionalities. I think this is a good starting place for a future team to pick up this project and implement some testing specs regarding the functionalities that the authors have fixed.,1213895,-1,8044
"Yes, I believe this code is ready to be deployed as it seems perfeclty fin  ",1213510,-1,8044
"The link to the deployed application was not available, so the project could not be tested.",1213549,-1,8044
the code looks fine. The only concern is related to the CI build which is failing at the moment. Some of the tests are failing because of the change.   ,1213310,1,8044
"Yes, since the issues are fixed as required, I think that the project can be merged to the production server. However, there is some work on the conflicts upon resolution of which the fixes can be included to the code. I don't think that there is a need to take another approach for solving the issues.",1213595,1,8044
"Because they did not provide a link for me to test, i am not sure if their code has bugs, so i don't know if this code is ready to be deployed onto server.",1212269,1,8044
The build was failing last time as well but not fixes were made.,1213488,1,8044
Travis CI is passed there is no issues with the build,1211880,-1,8044
The build did not pass Travis CI.,1212041,1,8044
The pull request that the authors have submitted does not pass the Travis Bot builds. But the bot has failed in the tests for which the authors haven't changed any code. So overall the pull request doesn't seem to break any code.,1213891,1,8044
NO I don't find any conflicts in the work which needs to be resolved.,1213506,-1,8044
The travis tests have failed. There was one main failure in the Travis log which could be addressed.,1213545,1,8044
The CI build was failing in the previous submission as well in the new submission. The team should have corrected the same.,1213306,1,8044
"The build for the pull request has not passed and has the same issues from round 1.  Build logs suggest that out of 4 build jobs, 3 jobs pass and 1 job still needs work.  According to the build job 4 log, there is a json parser error which needs to be fixed.",1213591,1,8044
"No, the build did not pass. It seems that airbrake_expection_errors_feature_tests_spec.rb has some problem.",1212265,1,8044
"Code looks concise. However at few places, indentation is messed up.",1213155,1,8021
The code has been written as per the coding standard. The code written by the team adheres to dry principle.,1211536,1,8021
"the code was well written, following the principles.",1213387,-1,8021
I'm essentially keeping my feedback the same. There are places where I believe that better names could be used and smaller javascript methods could be used. ,1212816,1,8021
max_choosers name was not changed. As far as i understand it denotes the maximum number of slots and should be called max_slots. which is not changed. Apart from this code is good.,1212718,1,8021
"Yes, code is well written",1213719,-1,8021
"The code is well written and follows all the DRY problems.  The team has changed the files based on previous reviews and to make it more DRY comments before the methods that they created gave a better understanding what each code does. // function for showing warning when number of slots is set as zero   Changing the names that suited the functionality more, is appreciated. addCreateTopicSection() appendCreateTopicSection()  ",1213012,1,8021
There does not seem any issues with the code. The team has properly used the naming convention and has provided comments wherever necessary,1211990,1,8021
"The code was well written during the last review too, it only missed comments. A few comments have been added but still a major portion of code remains uncommented.  Other than that, the code is nicely written, follows guidelines and variable names are appropriate.",1211723,1,8021
Few new commits are made,1213156,-1,8021
There has been 2 commits made in second round. One for adding comments and another one for fixing Issue #926 the sorting of topics by topic number in assignments.,1211537,-1,8021
3 New commits,1212719,-1,8021
Properly done in round 2 also,1213720,-1,8021
"The team has done few commits. One was on few sort fixes, while they other was on refactoring.",1213013,-1,8021
"The team has added some new commits which are about the added comments. The team has picked up the suggestion from the previous review to add comments for better readability, which is commendable.",1211991,1,8021
A commit was done in second round addressing issues from reviews.,1211724,-1,8021
The coverage is actually decreased.,1213158,-1,8021
The team has done good manual testing but it would help to add few test in features to test the impact of the changes done in functionality of the project.,1211539,1,8021
"The overall coverage decreased, but not significantly. It reduced by 0.01%/",1213390,1,8021
No new tests were written for this functionality. ,1212819,-1,8021
No New Tests,1212721,1,8021
"Yes, team has added the test case",1213722,-1,8021
No new test cases were added. The new code changes don't change the modify the existing code coverage. The modifications were mostly on UI. They could have added capybara testing.,1213015,1,8021
"Unfortunately, I could not see any code written by the team for testing. However, the team has provided a description on how some of the edge cases have been handled. According to coveralls, the overall test has decreased by 0.01%. This could be one of the major topics for improvements with regards to this issue",1211993,1,8021
"Tests have been thoroughly and very well performed. Also, well documented. ",1211726,-1,8021
No deployment provided so can't be verified.,1213159,-1,8021
Yes the features work as described in the problem statement. The team has done good job and has fixed all the below issues:  Issue #971 Change create topic UI into AJAX.   Issue #926 We need a way to sort topics by topic number in assignment#edit page.   Issue #718 We should allow instructors to give feedback when accepting or rejecting topic suggestions. ,1211540,1,8021
The code works as required.,1213391,-1,8021
The new features work as expected.,1212820,0,8021
"The operation works perfectly from UI as shown in the youtube screencast. The App was not deployed anywhere (or the link was not posted), so couldnt test it by myself. Application could have been deployed during the second review for better understanding and trying out how the feature works.",1213016,1,8021
"The working is perfect, everything works as intended. The team has explained this in a brief manner in their youtube video.",1211994,-1,8021
System works as expected and this is evidenced by tests and videos.,1211727,-1,8021
The write-up is informative and provides all necessary details of the changes made.,1213160,-1,8021
The write up is impressive and very detailed. It has been documented well which helps to understand about the project and the code implementation. It also provides detailed test plan which makes it easier for end user to do UI testing.,1211541,-1,8021
The writeup is well organized and well documented.,1213392,-1,8021
"The write-up is well written. It looks like they have improved the test plan sections, but still no automated tests in the repository.",1212821,1,8021
"Write up is good and self explanatory. Test plan helped a lot in understanding how to test it. As discussed in the earlier review, images could have been resized for better visibility. Was little difficult when one had to scroll along the page to view the entire image.",1213017,1,8021
"The writeup is well written with proper screenshots. I liked that the team has provided appropriate screenshots for specific scenarios which covers all the aspects of the project. However, the Test-plan section could be improved by adding the test code",1211995,1,8021
Writeup is very detailed and well written. It is supplemented by enough code pieces and reasoning and good amount of pictures and videos to explain what the team has done in detail.,1211728,-1,8021
" I think with proper testing, this code is ready to be deployed onto the production server.",1213161,-1,8021
The code has passed the travis test and has addressed  all the issues of the Change Request. The code should be production ready after adding few more edge test case scenarios.  ,1211542,1,8021
"Yes, the code can be deployed to production.",1213393,-1,8021
"Overall, I think it could be deployed. There are no tests however written for this functionality, and there are some UI patterns that should be re-considered before deploying that do not match each other. When saving feedback, the ability to save feedback is automatically present and there is a button per row, while in the other location, you must first make a row ""editable"".",1212822,1,8021
"Apart from some code-climate change, the code seems to be ready to merged",1212724,1,8021
"The code seems to be working good from the screencast. My biggest concern was, if the link to deployment was given, it would have been easier to try the features. Other than that, capybara test cases could have made it strong to go to the production server. If they feature did work the way as it was shown in the screencast, it can be deployed to production.",1213018,1,8021
"The team has checked most of the points given in the problem statement. However proper testing should be done before deploying this project on the main server. It must be ensured that the overall coverage increases. Other than the testing part, everything else has been implemented as expected.",1211996,1,8021
"The code is well written, tested and documented and hence I think it should be ready to be deployed. ",1211729,-1,8021
Yes the Travis CI build is passing successfully.  ,1213157,-1,8021
The build has passed. The are only 2 syntactical issues due to version difference.,1211538,-1,8021
The Travis Build has passed. The only conflicts remaining to resolve are the Code Climate conflicts.,1213389,1,8021
Everything but the CodeClimate checks passed,1212818,1,8021
No conflicts and Build Passes,1212720,-1,8021
Yes no conflicts at all which needs to be resolved,1213721,-1,8021
"Yes, the Travis CI has passed.",1213014,-1,8021
The build has passed in Travis CI and no conflicts have occured.,1211992,-1,8021
The build passes and there are only minor warnings and issues which can safely be ignored.,1211725,1,8021
Code style is good and Ruby Style guidelines are followed.,1214325,-1,8029
It was unit tests code.,1211662,-1,8029
Rspec code looks good. Descriptive context and it statements and good variable name usage. Very good work overall.,1212116,-1,8029
The coding style is good. The test cases have been written properly. Also I have seen from the code that the team has covered different cases and not stuck to the common one.,1213026,-1,8029
The team has not added any comments nor changed the built test cases to reduce the redundancy in scores method. ,1212522,1,8029
"The code is well written. The dummies created are given proper and relevant names. However, I can not see much comments. I would suggest that inclusion of more comments would have enhanced the readability and efficiency of the project. ",1212102,1,8029
"There were no commits in second round, but this is due to the fact that they achieved a 100% coverage in round 1 itself.",1214326,-1,8029
"Nope, but they already did pretty well.",1214308,-1,8029
There were quite a few commits in the second round. The team worked hard to improve the existing test cases as well as add new ones. Even the mentor Zhewei approved of their work.,1213027,-1,8029
"The last commit was on October 30. However, the team had already achieved 100% test coverage.",1212523,-1,8029
I can see no latest commits . The last commit was on 31st October.,1212103,-1,8029
Project was already completed in round 1,1212670,-1,8029
yes,1214213,-1,8029
The coverage is 100% already.,1214328,-1,8029
100% coverage by the tests.,1212119,-1,8029
"For a testing project, increasing the coverage is important. Doesnt seem like the coverage was increased to a good extant. ",1212910,-1,8029
Yes the team had added the test cases and this did increase the coverage of the corresponding model file.,1213029,-1,8029
The team has not added any test cases but they had already achieved 100% test coverage in the first round.,1212525,-1,8029
Yes the team has added test cases. The coverage is however only 48%. ,1212105,-1,8029
improved,1214215,-1,8029
"The tests cover all the scenarios, hence they also possess 100% coverage.",1214329,-1,8029
They did unit tests,1211666,-1,8029
As stated above the tests cover most of the scenarios.,1213030,-1,8029
"yes, the test covers all the scenarios. ",1212526,-1,8029
cover all,1214216,-1,8029
The test cases are well written and do test many of the methods and functionalities. It is able to achieve around 60% of the task assigned to them.,1212106,-1,8029
Extremely well-written and verbose. ,1214330,-1,8029
"The Wiki is great, but I believe it's better to move the Testing framework part to front of the page.",1214312,1,8029
Very detailed,1211667,-1,8029
The documentation is detailed covering all the test cases.,1212121,-1,8029
The doc is very descriptive and well written. Good job!,1212912,-1,8029
I would describe the write as being: 1. Very meaningful. 2. Concise. 3. Precise Te authors do explain the assignment.rb file as well as their test plan in veryyyy much a detailed way.,1213031,-1,8029
The writeup has a brief explanation on the role of the AssignmentTeam in the expertiza project. They have given the details on the test plan and test cases. I think it is a good writeup.,1212527,-1,8029
The writeup is perfectly written clearly indicating the work done. It nicely shows how the work was done and what approach as followed.,1212107,-1,8029
"There are no errors in the build, the Travis CI build has passed and 100% coverage. You are good to go! :)",1214331,-1,8029
"The code is easy to read. As one places the model file along side the test code, it very much makes sense as to why they wrote each line.",1213032,-1,8029
The team has successfully managed to pass all test cases with 100% test coverage.,1212528,-1,8029
"One test case failing on travis. Once that is fixed, code can be merged.",1212675,1,8029
Good job done here! You are the only team among the ones I reviewed for whom the Travis build has passed.,1214327,-1,8029
All passed.,1214309,-1,8029
it was unit tests,1211664,-1,8029
No issues! Good job resolving all the issues.,1212909,-1,8029
There were just 3 conflicts with respect to codeclimate that needed to be resolved but the mentor seeing their good work had decided to dismiss those.,1213028,-1,8029
All checks have passed without any conflicts. Well done!,1212524,-1,8029
"The team has put a lot of efforts in writing the tests. However, the Travis CI tests are not passing.",1212104,1,8029

"The code changes are very less, so not much to say about refactoring, DRY problems etc. The code has ""put"" statements which are also pointed out by the code climate bot.Having put conditions is not a good coding style, the authors could have considered to remove the statements. puts ""hi, im in import""  puts name.to_s The authors could have debugged to see the flow of code, or remove them before committing.",1212893,1,8039

"The pull request was not updated. (In fact, I can't see any of the changes in the linked repo.)",1211544,-1,8039
"Nope, the last commit still shows from 12 days ago which is the time period even before the first submission. Overall, the branch is 3 commits ahead and 20 commits behind the Expertiza master. Even so, conclusively going by their git hub their last commit was before the first submission and hence, no commits in the second submission.",1212915,-1,8039
The commits were done before the first deadline but unfortunately I don't see any commits during the second round or the pull request might not have been updated.,1212733,-1,8039
No new commits after the first submission.,1212894,-1,8039
No new Test cases,1212791,-1,8039
Coverage decreased by .01%.,1211546,1,8039
"No, no visible test cases have been added and I even checked the files on their git repo for the same, but just like the first submission there is no change in the status quo of the project. As a matter of fact their overall coverage seems to have been decreased just as before which is still an unresolved cause of concern. ",1212917,1,8039
"I don't think that writing the test cases was in the scope of this project. Three files were changes overall, which two were .rb files and one was db file.",1212735,-1,8039
The team has changed a model and a html page. But there are no new test cases attached to the changes.,1212896,-1,8039
Works,1212792,-1,8039
The import fixes appear to function properly.,1211547,1,8039
"As said above no visible testing scenarios have been implemented or even covered in their doc that they have given. Moreover, no changes have even been made since the last submission. So, answer to all the above questions is no. ",1212918,-1,8039
The project works as mentioned in the file.  ,1212897,1,8039
Writeup is still in the form of a word doc instead of a wiki. Test Plan and Tests are missing.,1212793,1,8039
The writeup is good; I can clearly understand the problems and the fixes.,1211548,-1,8039
"Their writeup is still the same doc file they had uploaded in the first submission. Now, while it was a good progress in resolving some of their errors in their first submission, clearly it is insufficient to be considered adequate for the second submission seeing as no changes have been made to it. ",1212919,1,8039
The write-up is very well written and documented. It is aided well with the the help of screenshots and proper labelling. The only small thing that I would like to suggest is the steps to reproduce or something similar so that the person not familiar with the expertiza can also reach to the desired place.,1212737,-1,8039
"Writeup clearly explains what their use cases are and what solution they came up with. There is a lack of background about it, how to test it from UI, test plan, test cases, DRY principle etc. Their write up is not on wiki, which makes it difficult to download the file every time and check it. Although it was pointed out during the first round, the team didn't change it , or they didn't update the wiki page which they created.",1212898,1,8039
Again wiki page is missing. They submitted a google doc for the same,1213845,1,8039
"While the functionality is present, there are several debug statements in the code that need to be removed and tests need to be added.",1212766,1,8039
Not ready to be deployed. Some changes needed along with addition of tests,1212794,1,8039
"These fixes appear to be acceptable. Code Climate could be better, and debug code could be removed, but if the changes in the document are in the source, than I have no complaints.",1211549,1,8039
"No, this code is not ready to be deployed since it fails in basic builds and just passes 5 out of 13 test cases which calls for reasonable concerns and traceback in the motivation of the teams approach. However, it does prove to be a good starting point for a future team to pick from where these people have left off. ",1212920,1,8039
I think the project looks pretty close to be merge-ready and with a small amount of work on the coding styles and making sure all the PR checks pass the code can be deployed on the production server. It might however require some rigorous testing before getting merged.,1212738,1,8039
"The code does its functionality, but it's not tested.  My biggest concern would be to have the test cases written for it before the production version.  It is a good starting place for a future team to pick up and just cover the test cases.",1212899,1,8039
"The build passed, but the danger checks and CodeClimate checks did not",1212762,1,8039
CI Fails,1212790,1,8039
"It passed Travis, but there were some code climate issues that could've been easily addressed.",1211545,1,8039
"Nope, they have errors in their build too as indicated by Travis CI and this is the error message output by it "" Hey @ppvasude, Something went wrong with the build. TravisCI finished with status errored, which means the build failed because of something unrelated to the tests, such as a problem with a dependency or the build process itself."" On checking the build logs I found that they errors in Bundle Install stage itself resulting from missing gems which they haven't resolved as a part of second submission.   ",1212916,1,8039
"Yeah, the build has passed the Travis CI test and there were no conflicts found on the pull request.",1212734,-1,8039
The Travis CI has passed.,1212895,-1,8039
Yeah the UI and everything else looks as it is supposed to and the functionalities work as well.,1212736,-1,8039
Code looks good. Well formatted and naming conventions are followed. ,1213571,-1,8024
The code was well written and implemented the functionalities needed. It made good use of naming conventions and the team worked on improving the code layout by following the Ruby style guide and DRY principles.,1213380,-1,8024
Overall the write up was not bad. Here were some of the things I believe that could be improved: Problem Statement;Seems to be wrong. I believe it should be included in the background as it merely describes the files that they are supposed to work on.,1213076,-1,8024
Travis tests have passed. There were some initial failures but the team has fixed it. There are no lingering failures.,1213573,-1,8024
"The code passes for the Travis build as well as Danger Bot. However, it fails for code climate with 3 issues yet to be fixed. In totality, the pull request does satisfy the need to pass the required builds.",1213382,-1,8024
the build passes,1212692,-1,8024
The overall structure of the code looks good and all the coding standards have been followed. I feel like there could have been more comments to support the large amounts of changes that have been made.,1213651,-1,8032
No proper commenting . authors havent improved as expected.,1212515,1,8032
"The code has been written as per the coding standard. The code written by the team adheres to dry principle. However, as per my first review comments it is advisable to follow better naming conventions. The team could rename their function names such as the below one to something smaller such as get_time_diff. The code needs refactoring in names and addition of comments.   def get_time_diff_btw_due_date_and_now(due_date)",1214361,1,8032
The project follows most of the DRY principles,1214205,-1,8032
Issues related to not mentioning the functionality of each method have been resolved. The wiki now mentions what each method does and what issue does it fix. Only issue with the current codebase is that it contains very long functions that could have been refactored and broken down. The 'perform' function contains a lot of lines and has tons of if-else statements.,1212998,1,8032
There's still some minor style issues in the code regarding unnecessary parenthesis.,1212557,1,8032
Yes the code has been well written and very ruby like. The usage of existing gems is good. Functions have were good. I did not find many issues with the first review. So authors have kept it the same. very well done.  I wanted few more comment in code but thats okay. ,1211786,-1,8032
no new commits.,1212516,-1,8032
No the new code was not committed during the second round. This could be due to the fact that the team finished their code at the end of the first round itself.,1213652,-1,8032
The team has not made any new commits in round 2 because they did the code implementation in round 1.,1214362,-1,8032
The last commit was made on Oct 31,1214206,-1,8032
No new code or improvements have been done in round 2. Only documentation has been edited. The code could have been improved a little after the suggestions were given.,1212999,-1,8032
No new code was necessary.,1212558,-1,8032
No new commits in 2nd phase,1211787,-1,8032
No new commits during the second round.,1213946,-1,8032
test cases were added to increase the coverage.,1212518,-1,8032
The team has added 2 test cases in the sidekiq_mail_worker_spec. More test cases could be added to fully test the functionality. ,1214364,-1,8032
"The team has added test cases and the coverage has increased marginally for most files. However, the coverage reduced for one file which might be because a particular corner case was not tested.",1214208,1,8032
"Test coverage has increased by a very small margin. More tests would have been better. There are only 2 tests. There are various other scenarios that could have been tested like missing or wrong attributes in request,email.",1213001,1,8032
"Coverage is present, slightly increases the overall project coverage.",1212560,-1,8032
Yes the team added the test cases. 45/69 new lines have been covered in the  tests. good work. but I feel that they could have added additional -ve test cases. ,1211789,-1,8032
Yes everything does seem to work properly. Since this was a refactoring project every feature worked as it was supposed to.,1213655,-1,8032
Features work as expected.,1212519,-1,8032
This project is based on emails which cannot be tested in test environment.,1214365,-1,8032
The team has implemented most of the required functionalities,1214209,-1,8032
"The features work as they are supposed to, only problem is with the code using excessive if-else like structure. Code is brittle in this sense. Could have made functions and passed parameters to make it more flexible.",1213002,-1,8032
Functionality seems correct.,1212561,-1,8032
yes ,1211790,-1,8032
The refactored mailer with the use of Sidekiq works as intended.,1213949,-1,8032
"The writeup has been pretty well written by the team. Introduction to the problem statement, the implementation details, and the test plans have been stated.  ",1213656,-1,8032
writeup is too concise code were addded. But the implementation was not explained in detail.,1212520,1,8032
The write up addresses details of all the three problem statements along with the code changes done in every file and the files added. The team has also added screenshots of the manual testing.,1214366,-1,8032
The writeup is comprehensive and includes code that was added so it is easy to understand.,1214210,-1,8032
Lots of improvement over the last phase. Many recommendations have been implemented. The write up is well formed and structured. The entire flow is explained along with files changed/methods implemented in each stage. Some formatting issues so -1,1213003,-1,8032
The test section has been improved with more detail.,1212562,-1,8032
"authors have added a new doc in addition to wiki. i think that is not required, they could have simply added that in the wiki.  as in review 1 would have liked a. link to the issue in problem statement  2.  more details in why this sidekiq was used and not other message queue",1211791,-1,8032
"Write up is elaborate, and elucidates the test cases and tests well.",1213950,-1,8032
The code is ready to be deployed in my opinion to the production server. The team could improve the quality of their code by visiting the code climate tests.,1213657,-1,8032
code can be deployed on production server as necessary test cases and implementation has been carried out succesfully.,1212521,-1,8032
"The code implementation is correct , so with more edge test cases and after resolving the warnings in the travis test, the code would be production ready.",1214367,-1,8032
The code is written well but there are some small build issues as pointed out by Travis CI which need to be rectified for it to be deployed,1214211,-1,8032
"Code is ready to be deployed in production if it is refactored and broken down into smaller chunks. Maintenance might me tough on this one. Functionality wise, works great!",1213004,-1,8032
"There's a lot of changes made to the project to incorporate Sidekiq, but assuming that's fine, the project is ready for merge.",1212563,-1,8032
I think we cannot add it to production because i feel authorization for the newly added pages is required.  once that is done it should be okay to add the code after further testing  ,1211792,1,8032
"There are a few warnings thrown by other tests that must be rectified, but otherwise ready to deploy.",1213951,1,8032
The code has been merged in a good way and there have been no merge conflicts. The build did pass the Travis CI. The code climate test failed but those were small issues which can easily fixed by just revisiting the code. Also the team have added a debug code which will need to be removed.,1213653,-1,8032
build did not pass in travis ci.,1212517,1,8032
The build has passed and has no conflicts with the base branch.,1214363,-1,8032
Some of the tests passed but there are still some unresolved build errors on Travis CI. There are pending issues which need to be rectified,1214207,1,8032
Travis CI runs smoothly and no errors occurred. No conflicts occurred.,1213000,-1,8032
Everything checks out.,1212559,-1,8032
yes build passed but there are many code climate warnings that can be easily cleaned up such as tips for refactoring and unassigned variables. A more careful look at the tool warnings was required.,1211788,-1,8032
Code build passed the Travis CI build with some warnings thrown by the other tests.,1213947,-1,8032
"Yes, improved the code.",1212529,-1,8020
"yes,  2 commits were made in round 2.",1213034,-1,8020
"Yes, new commits were done.",1212530,-1,8020
yes,1213142,-1,8020
Yes. Twice during the second round.,1213093,-1,8020
Coverage has increased.,1212532,-1,8020
Works as intended. Features work as they are supposed to. Tests cover all scenarios.  ,1213096,-1,8020
The system works perfectly as intended.,1211966,-1,8020
The system works as intended.,1214055,-1,8020
The video explains the new functionality and the functionality is working as expected. all the scenarios are covered in the rspec test as well. Good job!,1213180,-1,8020
The writeup has adequate screenshots to help understand the problem statement,1212499,-1,8020
"Overall, it is well written.",1212940,-1,8020
Contains all the required explanation.,1212534,-1,8020
"there is no code included in the write-up,but the team had mentioned the changed files in the write.As a reviewer, it is difficult to find out which code has been added by the team. The team should clearly explain what they are doing.",1213429,1,8075
"The code is well written, the way the list function was split into multiple modular functions is appreciable. A great amount of effort has gone into fixing the issues.",1213952,-1,8075
"Code is written very well, comments are detailed and functions and variables are named appropriately. (would just like to point out, in student_task_helper.rb#due_date_color , the variable ""rtn"" could've been named better!)",1212942,-1,8075
New code added is written well with DRY and no long or complicated functions. I could see file updated has changes on line such as tab and space. Team could work upon indentation. ,1211927,1,8075
"Code Snippet added.  Still, Git link is not of the pull request.   No link provided for the change. Either screencast or the URL of the deployed application would have been ideal.",1211772,1,8075
"The code written is following the Ruby on rails guidelines. The variables, methods, and class names do seem to follow proper convention and are suggestive of the functionality they are being used for. In some cases they could have used a little more descriptive names for variables for example inside app/helpers/student_task_helper.rb  they could have used background_colour instead of rtn as a variable name in the due_date_color() method. It will become more readable for the reviewers to understand the functionalities. Also they have added to few commits for the amount of code change that they have done. The commit messages  are not descriptive enough about what changes have the authors committed. ",1214030,1,8075
The code is well written. No issues with naming conventions or coding style.,1212564,-1,8075
The code is very well written and comments are properly given. Also the variables are descriptive and ruby guidelines are followed.,1211606,-1,8075
The code is clean.,1211627,-1,8075
overall only 3 commits are made during the entire project. no new code was committed during the second round,1213430,1,8075
No changes were committed in round 2.,1213953,1,8075
Could not see any new commits after last change. Also commits distribution is not equal.,1211928,1,8075
No New commits.,1211773,0,8075
No new commit has been added since the last submission. The commit messages are not descriptive. They should commit small portions of code one by one with proper description of the changes in the commit  message. Also their functions seem to be very long. they may consider refactoring and creating more cohesive code. Each function should do only one task.,1214031,1,8075
No new commits in the second round.,1212565,1,8075
"There have been only two commits - one on 30th Oct and second on 31st October. There have been no commits since. It would have been better if you people had given one more commit resolving the issues given by code climate, since most of them are trivial. ",1211607,1,8075
No test cases are added by the team and overall coverage of the project is decreased by 10.6%.,1213432,1,8075
The team has added testcases but lacks coverage. The overall coverage decreased by 10.6% to 37.063%.,1213955,1,8075
Test are written ,1212945,-1,8075
Team could have added test plan in wiki along with test covered and test description. Also could have worked upon increasing test coverage.,1211930,1,8075
Test Plan could be described better.,1211775,1,8075
the team has implemented there testing plan and have been very thorough with there test cases. They seem to have considered a lot of cases and have implemented them in rspec. The only thing that they should do is use different commits for adding test cases.,1214033,1,8075
No new test cases are written.,1212567,1,8075
"It is given in wiki that most of your test cases depend on checking the output. However, like I mentioned in my last review, several test cases like the ones mentioned below can be automated. This is especially true as TDD is explicitly mentioned in your problem statement: ""Write the required tests before implementing/refactoring the methods in the above-mentioned classes"".  Add past due assignments to the students task list (on Student View). Check for correction in due dates of assignments (when an assignments due date is edited, it should be appropriately moved from the Past assignments list to the Current Assignments list if needed) On Student Task page, separate the list of 'teamed with' students from the current tasks box. ",1211609,1,8075
Yes.,1211630,-1,8075
I could neither test it manually nor there were any videos to check the functionality.,1213956,1,8075
"I could not get a deployment link or watch a video that demonstrates the work done. So, I'm unable to test.",1212946,1,8075
I can not see any link to test changes as well as no video to watch the changes. Team could have shared implemented part to test and review.,1211931,1,8075
No Screencast or deployed URL provided.,1211776,1,8075
The bug fixing does work according to the screenshots provided by the authors. They have provided a step by step screenshot of the issue that they have fixed. The authors haven't hosted their version of the expertiza so it is very difficult to actually check the functionality. They could have hosted expertiza on VCL or they could have put a screen cast of the working functionality to help in reviewing.,1214034,1,8075
"Yes, it works as intended. It would be better if you could add a video recording of the flow/screenshots of the flow in the test plan. ",1212568,1,8075
The operations work as intended but need to have automated test cases.,1211610,1,8075
Write-up needs serious attention of the team. The approach followed is good but it still needs to be worked on. the write-up should include contents which makes it self-explanatory.,1213434,1,8075
"The write up is lacking screenshots, for example, the colour coded views etc and the test plan to verify the issues. Only the test plan for colour coding has been mentioned. The issues and the plan of action have been described properly.",1213957,1,8075
"- The write-up does mention the files changed but misses out on adding code snippets. - Little formatting inconsistencies found like ""-- Expertiza Project"" in the introduction, and a "":-"" only for Overview but none of the other headings. - Looks like ""Separate the list of 'teamed with' students from the current tasks box"" needs to be a heading rather than plain text! - Now we have created a separate table for assignments"" sounds ambiguous - does it mean a new database table or a html table..? Please be specific. - ""A helper function was also added to format a string into multiple lines"" - please mention what the string is about (what it represents), what are these multiple lines that it is getting split into, and why you would want to split them. - Test Cases are not stated. Test Plan does mention one as ""for example"" but the testing process could've been given a little more respect. :)",1212947,1,8075
Write up is too brief. No detail description of approach taken as well as no picture to relate to changes as suggested to add in last review.  ,1211932,1,8075
Write-up is explained pretty well.,1211777,-1,8075
The wiki documentation has been updated. All the information has been documented in a neat and logical manner. The write up adequately provides what functionality the work is related to. They havent updated any part of the wiki documentation but overall their documentation is concise and to the point.,1214035,1,8075
Detailed. But the screenshots of the manual testing are missing in the test plan.,1212569,1,8075
"The write-up is very detailed as to what features have been implemented but lacks on explaining how they are implemented. It can be improved by adding how the features have been implemented, why they chose this logic to implement the features and how to test the code or show how they have tested the code.",1211611,1,8075
"lacking necessary UI description, eg, the final appearance of the task list or the pathway to show a task list.",1211819,1,8075
"before deploying the project onto the production server, this projects asks  for some attention. new test cases should be added to the project. I can't say much on that.",1213435,1,8075
"Yes, the code has been written aptly and to the point. The intention is clear.",1213958,-1,8075
"Code looks okay, and the spec is written in detail. But as mentioned earlier, I'm not in a position to judge due to lack of video or deployment link or even some screenshots proving the work.",1212948,1,8075
"No. i can not see any link of video to check the changed functionality or system, hence it is difficult to pass the changes to production. Yes new team can take up remaining changes and provide a working system.  ",1211933,1,8075
Not able to see the changes done by the team. Test plan could have been explained better. If the URL or the screencast was provided it would have been better.,1211778,1,8075
I think the code need some amount of refactoring before it can be merged with the expertiza master and pushed to production. Some of the functions implemented by the team seem quite long and they should try and restrict the functionality implemented in each function to just one.,1214036,1,8075
Codewise no issues. Build issue has to be fixed.,1212570,-1,8075
"The code seems very well written and approach seems correct. If they improve the documentation and add test cases after thorough testing, it should be good to be deployed. As it stands, another team in future can pickup the code and implement these improvements.",1211612,-1,8075
"The view file contain 200 more files so it is quite difficult to figure out the structure of the View. It is better if independent component is introduced to construct the whole task view. And the commits contain the Gemfile, which is considered not secure to deploy for it alters the production environment. ",1211820,1,8075
The build fails. there are 3 warnings which needs team's attention. there are no conflicts with the base branch.,1213431,1,8075
The Travis CI build has failed.,1213954,1,8075
"One of the Travis CI tests is failing, https://travis-ci.org/expertiza/expertiza/builds/449165455?utm_source=github_status&utm_medium=notification  Found many ""code climate"" issues.",1212944,1,8075
Pull request is not passed as well as Travis CI is also failed.  ,1211929,1,8075
No link of the pull request provided.,1211774,1,8075
The travis CI build did not pass. But the tests on which the build fails has no direct relationship with the code that the team has changed or added.,1214032,1,8075
Travis CI build is failing. Other things are fine.,1212566,1,8075
The Travis build passed but there are a lot of warnings and issues that have not been fixed. MAny of them are trivial and easy to fix. ,1211608,1,8075
"Code is well written, DRY.",1213903,-1,8031
"The names and the structures of the functions are all used properly. Besides, the team gave comments on the codes, which makes it is easier to understand.",1212851,-1,8031
"The wiki explains the problem statement well and proposes relevant solution . The team has done a great job on stating the design approach and has included diagrams for them. However, the team needs to add the testing plan for the project.",1215528,1,8093
"Although not all sections of the document are complete, upon completion, these sections will be more than adequate in successfully describing the project, its design, purpose, and intent. Nice work.",1214819,1,8093
"The project writeup explains very well the topics that it has covered. However, it has not covered many of the topics like implementation, and even a test plan.",1216976,1,8093
"Lots of good background details is given, but the testing and implementation sections are missing.",1215890,1,8093
"It seems you have all the needed sections(and then some!). You just need to rename them to project purpose, project design, and testing plan. For example, the section titled Testing should be renamed to Testing Plan. ",1216636,1,8093
design doc is complete except for implementation and testing which is not required for this review ,1216365,1,8093
Yes The project is complete and sound enough in its approach and the implementations and the test plan has been well devised and just shy of application.  ,1215713,1,8093
The document is well written in properly segmented sections.,1215270,-1,8093
Very well written doc with all the necessary details.,1216197,-1,8093
No future plan mentioned,1214784,1,8093
Testing plan is missing. Overall looks good. Can add snapshots. Lists out all the functionalities The project is complete and sound enough in its approach and the implementations.,1216652,1,8093
the project describes the project requirement in detail. the project statement is clear. the team has also included the design/flow which they will be following in order to achieve the desired results. the testing strategy is currently missing from the wiki. the team should inlclude the test plan in the documentation.,1215042,1,8093
The plan is very well documented. I see a lot of brain storming happening,1217168,-1,8093
The team's design includes all the models required for incorporating the functionalities. The have depicted a high level design in diagram as well. ,1215529,-1,8093
"The design section of the writeup gives a very high level view of the design the team has planned to implement. So, not much can be deduced until the teams drills down further regarding the same.",1216977,-1,8093
The design plan seems to encompass everything required by the project.,1215891,-1,8093
yes it does ,1216366,-1,8093
"Yes, they have everything that a good doc requires except the empty sections of implementation, design and testing. These in my opinion should be a part of a very important focus.   ",1215714,-1,8093
"Yes, the team seems to have incorporated all the functionality needed.  ",1215271,-1,8093
"It does list out all the functionality, but there seem to be no solutions for them. An insight into the solutions to be implemented would be suggested.",1216653,1,8093
the team did a great work in understanding the requirements and have included the design for all the requirement mentioned in the requirement document.,1215043,-1,8093
Yes they talk about all the functionality to be implemented,1217169,-1,8093
The authors has discussed the functionality implementation in detail. It justifies the approach they would be using.,1215530,-1,8093
"Changes are not currently elaborated upon. There is a section labeled 'implementation"" that will house these details.",1214821,1,8093
"The explaiantions were the best part of the writeup. The author has kept in mind that the reviewer might not be familiar with the basics of expertiza, and hence gives a very lucid explaianation.",1216978,-1,8093
The proposed changes look good.,1215892,-1,8093
"team suggested that usage of decorator pattern is the key solution to the improvement, also approach on DRYness will be handled later",1216367,-1,8093
"Changes are not proposed to a suitable extent as they have mostly elaborated on the problem statement. I say this because even though they have detailed diagrams and solutions in place, they have left important parts like tests and implementation empty. It yet remains for them to implement them and explain in explicit details their action plan to arrive at the solution.    ",1215715,1,8093
Lacks the solution part,1214786,1,8093
Explanations are given adequately. ,1215272,-1,8093
I liked the idea of putting the important files for reference. This is extremely useful and makes it really easy to understand what is being done.,1216199,-1,8093
Good explanation of the proposed changes. You may want to add it in a separate heading. Overall explanation quality is adequate.,1216654,1,8093
the team has explained the implementation design/strategy in detail. the design was explained with all the required details and was very easy to understand.,1215044,-1,8093
Amazing documentation with diagrams and proper explanation!,1217170,-1,8093
The design proposed by the author of reusing LotteryController just like in topic bidding seems reasonable to address the bidding implementation in peer review.,1215531,-1,8093
"As me tioned above, the design is not completed,  and gives only a high level view. So, answer to this question cannot be justified using the given writeup.",1216979,1,8093
"As mentioned in the document, some of the proposed changes are not DRY, which I would like to see improved if possible.",1215893,1,8093
"As for the designs proposed by the authors it proves to be substantial since there is a good amount of Design aspect in their doc.  Sure, they have defined an application flow, but that is all there is to it.  1. Nothing about adding a method to any class has been suggested. Implementation section is left blank.  2. The design hasn't been implemented to the depth to make it a code let alone make it smelly.  3. Nothing mentioned about the design to make it complicated and the piece of code which they would delve into to ascertain of any pre-existing gems for simplification.  4. This too is hard to reach a conclusion on since not enough details to answer it with certainty.  5. Yes. Absolutely, a much more thorough investigation should be carried out and relevant previous work exploration with help solve the cause.    ",1215716,1,8093
i feel new design will not add any additional overhead in response,1216368,-1,8093
Good application workflow and analysis. Appears to be sound.,1216655,-1,8093
The authors are aware of the principles and are yet to figure out a way to reuse the methods to implement the functionalities. No new methods were proposed in the documentation. The idea of implementation looks fine and the new design seems seems to follow the already written code structure and design patterns. The design doesn't pose any threat to time complexity.,1215045,-1,8093
Not much has been talked about the methods or classes the changes will be done to. But they are clear with their job.  ,1217171,-1,8093
Diagrams on peer review assignment have been included in the design by the team.,1215532,-1,8093
The current umls are great. Make sure to include more of these visual aids in the implementation section of your document. It will be a wonderful writeup.,1214823,-1,8093
"Though the author has not used UML diagram, but the author has used other forms of picrorial representation to convey what he meant to say. But, the team should definitely consider adding one or two i the future.",1216980,1,8093
"Design document explains the entire project flow very well. The whole implementation plan is very well written which clearly explains how the team is planing to work on project. The idea of including screenshots which explains how the functionality will look like once all the implementation is done is what I liked the most. Suggestion: Team should include test plan in the doc.The purpose of project should be explained more clearly. Overall, nice work!",1215170,1,8062
"The team has well documented the problem statement and the details of the fix which is required. However, they have not included any design plan or test plan which could address the approach they have planned.",1215648,1,8062
The diagrams are good but don't necessarily help the reader understand the information - if anything I ended up understanding the writing better than the diagram.,1215894,1,8093
Excellent use of class diagrams!,1216640,-1,8093
" The document is simple to read and has the details mentioned for the the project purpose , the design of their implementation but they haven't included the test plan",1215910,1,8062
design doc has diagram explanation for working process ,1216369,-1,8093
There is a good amount of Diagrams technicality in terms of the section of Workflow flow  and Models and thus we can say that it does slightly help get a sense of putting things into perspective.  1. None. Both the diagrams seem important enough for the scope of the project and in conjunction with the intended functionalities. 2. The UML diagram is in line with the conventions and follows suite. 3. The diagrams are technically sound enough to define problem scenario. ,1215717,1,8093
"The design document has the required design and implementation plan. However, it isn't uploaded as a Wiki but as a PDF. This can be inconvenient for grading and is also a lot harder to modify for the team.",1216071,1,8062
Proper visual aids and UML like diagrams are provided in the document for better understanding of the implementation,1215274,-1,8093
well represented.,1216201,-1,8093
The design document is well done with proper visual aids and explains the problem being tackled and the proposed solution very well.,1215466,-1,8062
Could be better if you add the screens. Only conventional flow of diagrams is present. Adequate details.,1216656,1,8093
the team have explained the flow of models using data flow diagram and have explained the use case using the use case diagrams. some more designs regarding the approach of implementation can be added in the documentations such as sequence diagrams/class diagrams for new classes/modified classes.,1215046,1,8093
Yes. Very easy to follow just by looking once!,1217172,-1,8093
"First of all, the doc is  not a wiki page, which does not meet the requirement",1216951,1,8062
The background and the implementation plan is provided with detail. The files to be modified for each objective of the project is also stated. Testing plan is not stated.,1215320,1,8062
The document seems to be complete except the test plan. It would be better to include a test plan in the document.,1216872,1,8062
The design doc looks complete with all of the necessary details being covered.,1217158,-1,8062
The purpose of the project seems quite clear. The team has explicitly mentioned all the requirements that has been expected of them along with the ways to implement said requirements. There is no testing plan however. They should include that and then the document would be good to go.,1216605,1,8062
 They showed all the details which were asked for,1215370,-1,8062
"Good work but I find following missing for completeness, a. table of content b. current design and proposed changes  c. integration of new features in design  d. use case diagrams  e test plan    ",1215235,1,8062
The problem statement and implementation approaches are very clearly explained with screenshots.  Missing items: Test plan UML diagrams,1216380,1,8062
"Brilliantly written code document consisting of background, problem statement and the implementation plan. ",1215205,-1,8062
The authors have dine a good job of detailing the issues at hand and their proposed solution. UML diagrams like a flowchart could have been used to further clarify the working of the proposed design.,1216530,-1,8062
The design incorporates all the functionalities that needs to be implemented. No suggestions are required.   ,1215171,-1,8062
The suggested fix would address all the functionalities which is required to be implemented for the problem statement.,1215649,-1,8062
" Yes the design include all the required functionalities as their design plan. the problem statement specifies 3 task one is related to the admin panel , and two are related to the instructor panel . in their plan they have specified their approach and which all files need modification",1215911,-1,8062
The document outlines all the required functionalities along with the design and implementation plan stated   ,1216072,-1,8062
All the requirements have been covered,1215467,-1,8062
"Yes, most of the functionality are included. Besides, they also got detailed explanations.",1216952,-1,8062
Yes. It incorporates all the functionality required by this project.,1215321,-1,8062
Yes the design doc covers all of the required functionalities.,1217159,-1,8062
It seems that the design incorporates all of the necessary functionality. It also mentions details of how the team is going to implement said functionality.,1216606,-1,8062
 Some more specific details could be added,1215371,-1,8062
"Yes, functionalities mentioned are covered in the doc",1215236,-1,8062
"Yes, it covers everything.",1216381,-1,8062
Yes.,1215206,-1,8062
"Yes, the authors have a great job of including all the needed functionality. ",1216531,-1,8062
The team has provided enough explanation about how they are going to work on this project. Overall quality of explanation is good.  Suggestion: Include the purpose of implementing these functions/changes.,1215172,-1,8062
The team has proposed reasonable changes to address the problem statement in detail. The explanation justifies every change they have suggested.,1215650,-1,8062
 The changes that the author has proposed is quite inclined with the task that are expected to be completed. the author explains the the changes properly by mentioning the files that needs to updated along with the screenshots of the flow.,1215912,-1,8062
"The explanation is clear to follow but it could also include some more of the abstract design like UML diagrams, explanation of the use cases etc. ",1216073,-1,8062
Looks like the team spent some time looking at the code and coming up with the solution. Good Job,1215468,-1,8062
Their explanation is adequate and easy to understand.,1216953,-1,8062
"The authors have given adequate explanation in terms of the following what is existing currently, what needs to be changed. The have also explained with a diagram the exact place where they would be adding elements to the UI. Also the files required to be changed are also mentioned. ",1215322,-1,8062
 The suggested changes seem to be appropriate. Explanation was also easy to follow.,1216874,-1,8062
The overall quality of explanations is very detailed and good. I might even take few ideas from here to improve my own design doc.,1217160,-1,8062
 The explanations seem to be okay. Couldn't fully understand what they meant by 'use proper polymorphism to handle ...' in the problem statement part 2(b)i. ,1216607,1,8062
 They have explained adequately,1215372,-1,8062
Yes very well done in explanation of changes and what needs to be done. Screen shots are helpful. good work ,1215237,-1,8062
Comprehensive.,1216382,-1,8062
"Detailed implementation plan provided, including which files they expect to change and what the output should look like",1215207,-1,8062
The authors have done a pretty good job with explaining the proposed design. They have used wire frames to show us exactly where the changes are to be made. Adding a flow chart would make things much clearer.,1216532,-1,8062
The design seems to be precise. The description of the changes are provided in detail. Team has clearly mentioned about the approach that they will use. Enough efforts have been taken by the team to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it. ,1215173,-1,8062
The team has not proposed any design for the suggested changes.,1215651,1,8062
" As the project is more of adding features to the user interface of the website , the design plan is covering all the necessary steps that needs to be implemented",1215913,-1,8062
"The code design appears to be sound. The UI implementation as shown on the screenshot looks intuitive. However, the final implementation is necessary to say definitively that the code is not smelly ",1216074,-1,8062
"Design is good, there might be some changes when they start implementing it but its a good starting point.",1215469,-1,8062
I think their designs look complicated and there might be existing gems that can be simplified.,1216954,1,8062
The design appear to be good. Specific gems are also mentioned eg: paginate that would divide the document into discrete pages.,1215323,-1,8062
The design changes as described seem sound.,1216875,-1,8062
I don't see any trace of smells or redundancy in the proposed solution.,1217161,-1,8062
"The design seems to be sound. I would like more details on the database of the Bacui projects seeing as most of us don't know what they look like given that most of us have worked on Expertiza projects. So, a short description of the different tables the project is going to interact with along with any and all modifications would really help understand IF there will be any possibility that the design would turn out to be non-DRY or smelly.I think the team is good on what gems are to be used.",1216608,-1,8062
"detailed design is missing, the document covers only the screen shots and high level overview of what needs to be done",1215238,1,8062
"Code level implementation details are not provided. But, the approach looks clean.",1216383,1,8062
No potential smells or problems found.,1215208,-1,8062
"This is one area where the authors could have improved. Even though there is a good amount of textual description and images, the authors could have added a snapshot of the code changes that they wanted to propose. This would make it clear as to the exact changes that you propose and further help answer this question.",1216533,1,8062
Screenshot explains the functionality of project very well.It is really easier to understand how the end product will look like. Suggestion: the team should include a flowchart depicting the flow of the functionality. ,1215174,-1,8062
"The team has added the  mock up screens which helps to understand the proposed look and feel of the project implementation. However, there are no UML diagrams or design diagrams added for the project, due to which its difficult to understand their approach on fixing the issue.",1215652,1,8062
" Here the team has only included screenshot relating to how the UI of the system should look like which gives a idea of its appearance , However , They haven't given any UML diagrams to represent the flow of their work for example a flow chart relating to how their functionalities would co-ordinate.",1215914,1,8062
They have added a screenshot for each of the problem they plan to tackle.,1215470,-1,8062
"They show their design page as their visual aids, and their are helpful for readers to understand what their designs look like.",1216955,-1,8062
"UML diagrams are not mentioned but since these are UI changes, the changes are sufficiently explained with the help of representation of UI in terms of images.",1215324,-1,8062
The whole document is easy to understand and well-written. Suggestion: It would be better to include what tools and technologies would be used in the project.,1216876,-1,8062
There were ample of visual aids to explain and walk through the proposed solution. I liked it.,1217162,-1,8062
There are mock-ups for the final result of the team's changes. However I would like some UML like diagram or some flowchart explaning how a user gets to a particular point. I don't know if it's me or maybe my lack of familiarity with the Bacui interface but I found the navigation part a bit difficult to follow.,1216609,1,8062
 UML diagrams not present but rest of the document seems feasible,1215374,1,8062
Yes screen shots are helpful but the document missing flow control diagrams ,1215239,1,8062
Good that you have used screenshots to explain the approach. Include Use case and activity/flow diagrams also.,1216384,-1,8062
UI enhancements are provided here.,1215209,-1,8062
"They authors have used visual aids to their benefit. Even though they could have added a flow diagram, the wire frames and other screenshots they have used serve the purpose and add to the clarity of the explanation.",1216534,-1,8062
The doc contains almost everything in terms of design except for the test plan. You might want to add a test plan right away to go for a test-driven development.,1216101,1,8112
The team has very well explained the Goals and separation of concerns. The team could have 'proposed' a way to test the implementation.,1215915,1,8112
 This was excellently specific and succinct. Very nice work,1216131,-1,8112
"Document explains the problem well. One thing I would like to explained more is how strategy pattern being used will help reduce the code than the amount of code currently present, But i guess that will be explained better once the teams gets to implementing stuff and knows a bit more about the design.",1215360,1,8112
" Its fine. I have the gist of it, but most of the text in the document is cut and pasted from the Project Description. The uml is a nice touch, albeit super bare.",1216832,-1,8112
The project goals are stated in a simple and precise manner. The design document is readable and easy to understand from. They have provided the reader with the background which states the need to do the refactoring. They can include or add file names which they are about to change.,1217039,1,8112
"The authors have done a great job at analyzing the problem statement and explaining clearly their proposed solution. I could easily understand the problem statement from the write-up. Well written. However, the test plan is missing from the design document.  Suggestion :  You might want to add few success test cases and few edge test cases for removing reports.  ",1216837,1,8112
Well structured i think everything is covered,1215340,-1,8112
The doc is complete except the Test Plan. A test plan would make it complete. ,1216737,1,8112
"The design document coherently describes the project details including it's purpose and design. This helps to perceive implementation being carried out by the team to achieve the project goals. However, it could be improved by providing the test cases that have been carried out to get to the present state. ",1214748,1,8112
"   The team has efficiently described the problem statement and the need for undertaking such a project. Good effort. As it talks about refactoring, few more lines on the pain points of current design would have helped a great deal in appreciating the project. The design selection is great. Apt to the problem and the UML diagram to visualize it, is helpful. The UML diagram should have been more descriptive on how the current code is to be modified to incorporate the proposed design pattern, as it was not easily to know, if this pattern would fit the current code. Test plan is missing. ",1215875,1,8112
"The project design and project purpose parts are pretty detailed. However, for the test part, the authors only state that they will write tests for the new controller but no detailed test plan.",1215643,1,8112
The document explains well how the team is planning to approach the refactoring.,1215361,-1,8112
The team has incorporated all of the functionality required for segregation including the exact reports and functions to be removed out of review_mapping_controller.rb along with the design pattern to be followed(strategy  in this case).,1216102,-1,8112
" In a way, yes, because it copied the project description, and illuminated which models they wanted to create in the refactor.",1216833,-1,8112
 The design document includes all the functionality the team is hoping to achieve. they have explained clearly what they plan to work and modify.,1217040,-1,8112
"The authors have divided the design into sub-tasks which shows that they are very clear about their approach. As per the problem statement, the added functionality seems complete to me. Suggestion:   You could include an application flow diagram to elaborate more on how your solution will work.",1216838,1,8112
It has most of the functional features available.,1215341,-1,8112
"The design incorporates the basic functionalities required that include refactoring the review_mapping_controller file, to extrapolate it's features to the reports_controller file. It must also mention the procedure that the team would follow to move the reports from response_report method to the controller file.",1214749,1,8112
"   As the project is on refactoring, not many functionalities to considered. Given the problem statement, it clearly indicates the design should be able to incorporate the requested changes ",1215876,-1,8112
"Yes, the design incorporates all of the functionality required.",1215644,-1,8112
All the functionality is given for review_mapping_controller.rb along with the design pattern. ,1216738,-1,8112
The explanation is easy to follow. I am able to get a complete idea of what changes the team intend to make.,1216103,-1,8112
Expectations look attainable. The changes proposed are concise and crisp. Team should be able to do a good job with this implementation.,1215362,-1,8112
" Again, its fine. I don't understand the changes too well, but I also don't understand MVC and Expertiza very well either, but maybe they could have tried harder. I do feel there is a strong need to refactor and improve the code quality of Expertiza.",1216834,-1,8112
The authors have provided a nice pictorial description of different strategies using a UML diagram. The could add CRC cards or use cases or the application flow diagrams which will aide in the report presentation.,1217041,1,8112
  The authors have done a good job by identifying the sub-classes they plan to add. It would be good to have an overview of the class definitions. It is quite clear from the explanation that they plan to have different tasks depending upon the type of report to be removed.,1216839,1,8112
The changes proposed by the team have been specified in detail providing general requirements about each goal. But it does not make any specifics of the code that could help to infer the proposals with the functionalities. ,1214750,1,8112
"The explanations are provided as points which is very easy to follow and understand. Though, the need for the proposed UI change is not very clear to me. Few more details on actually how the strategy pattern is going to be incorporated in current code would have been insightful.    The explanation on the test controller is ambiguous.    ",1215877,1,8112
The explanation is clear. It would be better if the authors explain more about the strategy pattern they will use.,1215645,1,8112
The explanation is decent and comprehensible ,1216739,-1,8112
I don't see any of the above mentioned problems happening since the design matches perfectly with the objective. The topic itself is to move unnecessary code out of review_mapping_controller and hence according to the design the code will actually become cleaner and better.,1216104,-1,8112
The document does not explain the reason behind creating the new class ReportStrategy.,1217136,1,8112
"The proposed design seems reasonable. Before proceeding with the project, team should also look at other references to those functions and do it accordingly.",1215363,-1,8112
 Not enough implementation description to provide adequate feedback on this question.,1216835,1,8112
The implementation planned by the team seems to follow all ruby on rails guidelines and does seem to follow the DRY principle.  ,1217042,-1,8112
"It appears from the design that the authors have identified strategy pattern for implementation, which is a good design. I think that they can talk more about the design by specifying an overview of the new controller, i.e. specifying the methods they plan to add.",1216840,1,8112
The design proposed by the team specifies an addition of a new button to the buttons tray from the existing UI. The button when clicked must bring a menu of additional reports. This functionality should consider the mapping to the review_mapping controller file that will implement the given features.,1214751,1,8112
"   1)     No such indications are available. 2)     No such indications are available. 3)     No, the team is trying to simply the current design. 4)     At few places, the designs seems to indicate they would like to centralize or combine processing of data, which looks like an increase in response time. Clear justification is needed to say for sure. 5)     More explanation of the teams thought process is needed in the document to comment further ",1215878,1,8112
The design seems pretty good. The only drawback is the test plan is missing.,1215646,1,8112
No problem I could observe ,1216740,-1,8112
"The team has done a good job with the UML diagram. However, in my opinion, it would be better if they can add details for all the classes in the diagram.",1216105,1,8112
The UML diagram shows the various subclasses clearly. It would have been better if it had also explained a few attributes/ methods.,1215919,1,8112
" More or less an A for effort, but I don't know if the UML is fine with so little in it because we don't care about what those classes do, or if we should care and there should be more about those classes and their states and behaviors.",1216836,1,8112
"The teams implementation of a UML diagram seems to be a good way of representing the changes planned.The diagram could have been detailed with regards to the classes that are being added and modified. There should be attributes of each class , then the methods that are added or changed with the type of inputs to these methods and return types of these methods. ",1217043,1,8112
"the authors have made it clear by including mock-up screen of the proposed solution.  They have used class uml diagram for the newly identified sub-classes and hence, I think that they have made adequate use of visual aids. Suggestion: They can add use cases for the new feature.",1216841,1,8112
The UML diagram is having the correct contents but needs the rough names of class methods,1215344,1,8112
"The UML class diagram helps to understand the reports involved, their attributes and functionalities. It provides a general overview about the interrelation of the seven different reports.",1214752,-1,8112
"   1)     The diagram provided is a generalization for strategy pattern and more aligned to help give a simpler outlook 2)     The standards are not followed, as it should indicate the class type (as an interface) and the method implementations needed in the concrete classes 3)     The UML is high-level indication. More project specific diagram is needed  ",1215879,1,8112
"The authors provide a UML diagram to explain the relationship between the classes and a screenshot to show where they are going to add a button, which are really helpful.",1215647,-1,8112
A brief description for the class level implementation would be better.,1216741,1,8112
The doc contains almost everything in terms of design except for the test plan. You might want to add a test plan right away to go for a test-driven development.,1216101,1,8122
The team has very well explained the Goals and separation of concerns. The team could have 'proposed' a way to test the implementation.,1215915,1,8122
 This was excellently specific and succinct. Very nice work,1216131,-1,8122
"Document explains the problem well. One thing I would like to explained more is how strategy pattern being used will help reduce the code than the amount of code currently present, But i guess that will be explained better once the teams gets to implementing stuff and knows a bit more about the design.",1215360,1,8122
" Its fine. I have the gist of it, but most of the text in the document is cut and pasted from the Project Description. The uml is a nice touch, albeit super bare.",1216832,1,8122
The project goals are stated in a simple and precise manner. The design document is readable and easy to understand from. They have provided the reader with the background which states the need to do the refactoring. They can include or add file names which they are about to change.,1217039,1,8122
"The authors have done a great job at analyzing the problem statement and explaining clearly their proposed solution. I could easily understand the problem statement from the write-up. Well written. However, the test plan is missing from the design document.  Suggestion :  You might want to add few success test cases and few edge test cases for removing reports.  ",1216837,1,8122
Well structured i think everything is covered,1215340,-1,8122
"The design document coherently describes the project details including it's purpose and design. This helps to perceive implementation being carried out by the team to achieve the project goals. However, it could be improved by providing the test cases that have been carried out to get to the present state. ",1214748,1,8122
"   The team has efficiently described the problem statement and the need for undertaking such a project. Good effort. As it talks about refactoring, few more lines on the pain points of current design would have helped a great deal in appreciating the project. The design selection is great. Apt to the problem and the UML diagram to visualize it, is helpful. The UML diagram should have been more descriptive on how the current code is to be modified to incorporate the proposed design pattern, as it was not easily to know, if this pattern would fit the current code. Test plan is missing. ",1215875,1,8122
"The project design and project purpose parts are pretty detailed. However, for the test part, the authors only state that they will write tests for the new controller but no detailed test plan.",1215643,1,8122
The doc is complete except the Test Plan. A test plan would make it complete. ,1216737,1,8122
The team has incorporated all of the functionality required for segregation including the exact reports and functions to be removed out of review_mapping_controller.rb along with the design pattern to be followed(strategy  in this case).,1216102,-1,8122
The document explains well how the team is planning to approach the refactoring.,1215361,-1,8122
" In a way, yes, because it copied the project description, and illuminated which models they wanted to create in the refactor.",1216833,-1,8122
 The design document includes all the functionality the team is hoping to achieve. they have explained clearly what they plan to work and modify.,1217040,-1,8122
"The authors have divided the design into sub-tasks which shows that they are very clear about their approach. As per the problem statement, the added functionality seems complete to me. Suggestion:   You could include an application flow diagram to elaborate more on how your solution will work.",1216838,1,8122
It has most of the functional features available.,1215341,-1,8122
"The design incorporates the basic functionalities required that include refactoring the review_mapping_controller file, to extrapolate it's features to the reports_controller file. It must also mention the procedure that the team would follow to move the reports from response_report method to the controller file.",1214749,1,8122
"   As the project is on refactoring, not many functionalities to considered. Given the problem statement, it clearly indicates the design should be able to incorporate the requested changes ",1215876,-1,8122
"Yes, the design incorporates all of the functionality required.",1215644,-1,8122
All the functionality is given for review_mapping_controller.rb along with the design pattern. ,1216738,-1,8122
The explanation is easy to follow. I am able to get a complete idea of what changes the team intend to make.,1216103,-1,8122
Expectations look attainable. The changes proposed are concise and crisp. Team should be able to do a good job with this implementation.,1215362,-1,8122
" Again, its fine. I don't understand the changes too well, but I also don't understand MVC and Expertiza very well either, but maybe they could have tried harder. I do feel there is a strong need to refactor and improve the code quality of Expertiza.",1216834,1,8122
The authors have provided a nice pictorial description of different strategies using a UML diagram. The could add CRC cards or use cases or the application flow diagrams which will aide in the report presentation.,1217041,1,8122
  The authors have done a good job by identifying the sub-classes they plan to add. It would be good to have an overview of the class definitions. It is quite clear from the explanation that they plan to have different tasks depending upon the type of report to be removed.,1216839,1,8122
The changes proposed by the team have been specified in detail providing general requirements about each goal. But it does not make any specifics of the code that could help to infer the proposals with the functionalities. ,1214750,1,8122
"The explanations are provided as points which is very easy to follow and understand. Though, the need for the proposed UI change is not very clear to me. Few more details on actually how the strategy pattern is going to be incorporated in current code would have been insightful.    The explanation on the test controller is ambiguous.    ",1215877,1,8122
The explanation is clear. It would be better if the authors explain more about the strategy pattern they will use.,1215645,1,8122
The explanation is decent and comprehensible ,1216739,-1,8122
I don't see any of the above mentioned problems happening since the design matches perfectly with the objective. The topic itself is to move unnecessary code out of review_mapping_controller and hence according to the design the code will actually become cleaner and better.,1216104,-1,8122
The document does not explain the reason behind creating the new class ReportStrategy.,1217136,1,8122
"The proposed design seems reasonable. Before proceeding with the project, team should also look at other references to those functions and do it accordingly.",1215363,1,8122
 Not enough implementation description to provide adequate feedback on this question.,1216835,-1,8122
The implementation planned by the team seems to follow all ruby on rails guidelines and does seem to follow the DRY principle.  ,1217042,-1,8122
"It appears from the design that the authors have identified strategy pattern for implementation, which is a good design. I think that they can talk more about the design by specifying an overview of the new controller, i.e. specifying the methods they plan to add.",1216840,1,8122
The design proposed by the team specifies an addition of a new button to the buttons tray from the existing UI. The button when clicked must bring a menu of additional reports. This functionality should consider the mapping to the review_mapping controller file that will implement the given features.,1214751,-1,8122
"   1)     No such indications are available. 2)     No such indications are available. 3)     No, the team is trying to simply the current design. 4)     At few places, the designs seems to indicate they would like to centralize or combine processing of data, which looks like an increase in response time. Clear justification is needed to say for sure. 5)     More explanation of the teams thought process is needed in the document to comment further ",1215878,1,8122
The design seems pretty good. The only drawback is the test plan is missing.,1215646,1,8122
No problem I could observe ,1216740,-1,8122
"The team has done a good job with the UML diagram. However, in my opinion, it would be better if they can add details for all the classes in the diagram.",1216105,-1,8122
The UML diagram shows the various subclasses clearly. It would have been better if it had also explained a few attributes/ methods.,1215919,-1,8122
" More or less an A for effort, but I don't know if the UML is fine with so little in it because we don't care about what those classes do, or if we should care and there should be more about those classes and their states and behaviors.",1216836,1,8122

A brief description for the class level implementation would be better.,1216741,-1,8122
Everything has been described well and in details.,1217004,-1,8055
"at current state, the design doc has project problem, project solution, and design diagram, and each section has detailed description of the project. ",1216480,-1,8055
The document is well structured and provides all required information. ,1215285,-1,8055
"The design doc is well written , but they haven't specified any test plans. They've explained the steps well, but haven't written anything about tests.",1216370,1,8055
"There is no mention of testing, also code change related details have not been included. Otherwise the document is very good.",1216520,1,8055
"test plan is specified, but UML is missing. They have added the ER diagram though, which i don't think is required here.",1216712,1,8055
The document explains what was asked for,1215375,-1,8055
"The document clearly states what is missing and how they are planning to implement that thing , they state how many new criterion are they going to add to the search feature, However, I would suggest them to include how will they implement it. There is no explanation of how things will be done.",1215350,1,8055
The design document gives a clear picture of the intended functionality of the project but it should have included test cases or what would be tested.,1215758,1,8055
The design document describes the problem statement and the expected flow. But the approach section doesn't have any technical implementation details. It just explains the flow that is going to be implemented. Test plan is missing.,1216425,1,8055
"Project purpose and the proposed solution is defined in the documentation. However, the test plan is not stated in the documentation.",1215067,1,8055
"The project purpose and possible solutions are clearly described in this design doc. However, the author only talked about the solution but no exactly what they need to do to implement the solutions. Also, there is no testing plan.",1214986,1,8055
Yes everything is incorporated.,1217005,-1,8055
"Yes, almost everything seems perfect, only a little more explaination is required",1215376,1,8055
"All functions required are stated in the design document, which include search for user, assignment, questionnaire, and reviews. ",1216481,-1,8055
Yes.,1215286,-1,8055
"Yes, they've included all functionalities.",1216371,-1,8055
The design document covers all the possible cases and should be fine.,1216521,-1,8055
Yes it does. They have explained the propose solution as well for each issue.,1216713,-1,8055
The writeup does not talk about the functionalities . However they include what is missing and what they will include.,1215351,1,8055
The design incorporates all the basic functionality.,1215759,-1,8055
"Yes, almost all types of search functionalities are covered.",1216426,-1,8055
The design implements all the defined functionality elaborately.,1215068,-1,8055
"Yes, the design incorporates all of the functionality required and also gives the possible solutions.",1214987,-1,8055
The quality of explanation is good and adequate.,1217006,-1,8055
search questionnaire and search reviews don't have detailed explanation of what should be done.,1216482,1,8055
"The explanations seem very clear. Although, splitting the ER diagram into 1 or 2 more sections would have made the design simple to understand in my opinion.",1215287,1,8055
"The explanation of changes is good enough that it states what all needs to be added/re-implemented, but it does not elaborate on some technical aspects.",1216372,1,8055
The proposed search features are good. If all of them are implemented it should more than suffice.,1216522,-1,8055
it could be better if you tell in which files you'll be making those changes and if you'll create new functions or make change in existing functions.,1216714,1,8055
"The authors have proposed changes that they are planning to implement. However, they have not included how they will go on to implement these changes. ",1215352,1,8055
The changes proposed are good and clearly meet the objectives of the project.,1215760,-1,8055
Team has given information on how it will work after the the project is done. Could have given more detail on Design using UML diagrams and Files invovled in the Project,1215854,1,8055
Good explanations. Easy to follow.,1216427,-1,8055
"The changes proposed by the authors are elaborate overall. They have defined the changes extensively. However, the ""Search for Reviews"" section could have elaborated more about the search functionality. The authors could have explained what could be searched and how the search functionality can be used a little more elaborately. ",1215069,1,8055
"The authors explain the project pretty well, they also provide a diagram to show the relationship between different sets. However, the solution can be more detailed and maybe cover some edge cases.",1214988,1,8055
need more detail of design to show any future suggestion ,1216483,1,8055
"Code snippets are not mentioned, but design is properly done.",1215288,1,8055
"Overall, the design proposed seems good.",1216373,-1,8055
They didn't add the code change details or the files in which they might work. That's still fine as those details can be filled once the implementation is done.,1216523,1,8055
can't say in what file they'll make change as its not specified in the document. You can add what changes you'll be making and explain a little more for better understanding.,1216715,1,8055
"Yes, the changes are completely feasible",1215378,-1,8055
"The authors do not talk much about the technical aspects of how they are going to implement their work. The new design they proposed however seem to go on the right track. However, not much research is done till now.",1215353,1,8055
"The author has not yet presented how the work is going to be done, as work on the project might not have started yet.",1215761,1,8055
"Did not see much info on the files or classes the changes proposed, so its hard to comment here",1215855,1,8055
Code level details are not covered in this doc. But the high-level approach looks fine to me.,1216428,1,8055
The authors have added the methods in the right classes. The new design is properly refactored and the gems are relevantly used. The new design might potentially increase the response time of the system because of advanced search option.,1215070,-1,8055
"The authors need to provide more detailed procedures about how they going to implement their solutions, instead of the results after they done it.",1214989,1,8055
Yes they have provided an UML diagram which follows convention and explains their approach,1217008,-1,8055
"The diagram show relationships between different models involve in the project, helped to give a clear vision of what should be implement. But no implementation design is visible. ",1216484,1,8055
The team has added sufficient diagrams for the reader,1215289,-1,8055
The diagrams are succinct and well-understood.,1216374,-1,8055
"The ER Diagram is very well done. It encompasses all the classes and their attributes. Also the use of different shapes like diamond, square etc is great. ",1216524,-1,8055
uml is missing but er diagram is given. you can add a uml diagram it explains things better. ,1216716,1,8055
Not required for this project,1214798,-1,8055
The E-R diagram seems to deliver the task,1215379,-1,8055
"They have depicted their working strategy through an ER diagram. However, I would suggest them to include more UML diagrams to enhance understandability. Also, the ER diagram is somewhat incomplete.",1215354,1,8055
There is an ER diagram which defines the relationships in the system.,1215762,-1,8055
"I feel the diagram is more complex, team could have gone with some usecase/UML/CRC diagrams",1215856,1,8055
Just one ER diagram. Add use case and activity/flow diagrams.,1216429,1,8055
"The authors have visually represented the system by depicting the method through an ER diagram. However, the diagram is a little high level and does not completely explain the flow of the system.",1215071,1,8055
"There is an ER diagram helps the reviewer understand the relationship between different sets. Maybe more screenshot can be provided to show where is the search bar, etc.",1214990,1,8055
They have very well stated of about the purpose of their project. they have properly mentioned about the flow of their project which includes the flow chart for their project and also have specified of what kind of graphs they would prefer to show the visualization to the instructor. They have mentioned about how they will proceed in test case but haven't specified which files needs to be test inclusion of that would make the doc more complete,1215979,1,8106
"Wrtie up clearly explains the project purpose, what changes needs to be made, however including a mock test plan would have been better.",1215698,-1,8106
"Most of parts are included, but they should include more details in their doc.",1216999,-1,8106
The team has a well composed design document. they have structured there design document into well written sub parts like design purpose and visualizations and files to be changed. They could have written there testing plan in a more elaborate manner by mentioning what kind of testing frame works will be used and what functionalities will be tested. The could have also added some use cases.,1216470,1,8106
"Design document has all the necessary information like project design, test plan. The team has gone through their topic deeply and can be seen by their illustration of their implementation. Also, they have included code snippets which show thoroughness of their approach ",1217024,-1,8106
"The design doc contains project purpose, project design and testing plan in the wiki. The wiki contains mock visualizations which make it easy to understand the project proposal and how are they planning to do. The design flow as a flow chart adds to the ease of understanding. The test plan explains about the technologies that they are planning to use for testing. Suggestion:  The test plan could say what should be done in testing than just the technologies to be used for a particular part of code. For ed, we plan to have a dummy small data and see if the graphs output the visualizations correctly, if the sum id being counted to 100% of the class participation etc... the stacked version could also have been represented for better understanding.",1215190,-1,8106
"The document shows the flow of work really well.However, I would like to suggest to put more of test planning and the tools and technologies that will be used. This will enhance the quality of the document to a great extent.",1215325,-1,8106
"The design doc is good and provides a clear picture about the objective of the project. However,It would also be nice to know what features would be tested in the test plan.",1214768,-1,8106
All necessary sections are present.,1216687,-1,8106
The design document contains the project purpose and the changes proposed by the team. The design flow gives an overview of the bar graphs that the team plan to generate for selected criterias. The introduction section however should largely focus on the project description. ,1214753,1,8106
"The documentation covered almost everything from project purpose, design flow as well as some info on what files will be changed in the project.  Suggestion: I feel that the test plan was a bit vague. Some more details should have been provided. For example- What all features will be tested. Or maybe some info about edge cases and different scenarios that will be covered. ",1214881,1,8106
"The write-up is well written but is missing a few things - the original problem description, how will the changes being proposed will be implemented etc.",1215220,1,8106
Yes the design incorporates all of the functionalities,1215980,-1,8106
Incorporates intended functionality.,1215699,-1,8106
"Yes, their design has all of the functionality that are required.",1217000,-1,8106
The design document has included all the functionality that is required by the project description.,1216471,-1,8106
Yes,1217025,-1,8106
"The design incorporates and clearly explains flow of diagram for class performance, but not much is included for Integration of review performance. suggestion : The topic of Integration of review performance can be talked about in brief .",1215191,-1,8106
"The writeup shows very little since the work has not yet been started. Therefore it does not clearly incorporates what all functionalities will be required. However, there are some mentioned in proposed changes area.",1215326,1,8106
The design has a good design flow diagram which is clear and concise.,1214769,-1,8106
Yes the design incorporated all functionality required. But more explanation is needed around which graph they intend to show.,1216688,1,8106
The design follows the basic functionality expected by proposing a bar graph solution for the select criteria. It could incorporate the rubrics that the team are planning to target. The flow in general does help to understand the project.,1214754,-1,8106
The design document incorporated all the functionalities that the project is supposed to be implementing.  No suggestions. ,1214882,-1,8106
Yes,1215221,-1,8106
"The explanation is quite well documented such as including the flow chart , kind of bar graphs they would prefer and the files that they will update. Adding of screenshots of the flow of the website would make it more easy to understand for a leyman.",1215981,-1,8106
Changes suggested look good.,1215700,-1,8106
"The overall quality of the explanations are good, but they should include more details about their design, which may not be easy to understand.",1217001,-1,8106
the team has mentioned all the files that will be changed and have also written a paragraph stating what are the proposed changes. The team could also document the changes that are being made to individual code files stating the changes done using code snippets and the reason why the changes are being made. Also they can talk about what design patterns principle are being used to incorporate the functionality that is being proposed. The team could also use CRC cards to depict the proposed code changes. This will not only help readers understand the report better but also help the team in dividing work between the team members and fast tracking the completion of project.,1216472,-1,8106
"The team has well explained what are they going to change. Though I didn't get how are they going to do the proposed changes. Since they are going to introduce a new feature, they have focussed more on explaining how to use the new feature. ",1217026,1,8106
"The changes proposed for the Class performance is adequate and explains the files to be changed, what changes from the controller perspective and views perspective. no particular suggestions proposed",1215192,-1,8106
Right the project is in its initial phase. The overall changes proposed by the authors are now very unclear about how they are going to work.,1215327,1,8106
The team proposed to add a bar graph to give a pictorial view of the scores and indicate the performance of students.,1214770,-1,8106
"More explanation around only those two graphs are being considered is needed. While its early in the project, at least what changes will be made to a file could have been mentioned.",1216689,1,8106
proposed changes needs more explanation at the files and system specifically what files needs to be changed and how ,1216179,1,8106
"The changes proposed by the team include implementing a bar chart, stacked or single. Based upon the project description, it is advised that the team look for other alternatives like pie chart that would help to span the results with a minimal look.       ",1214755,-1,8106
A simple enough explanation has been provided for the functionality.  No suggestions.,1214883,-1,8106
Could not find any explanations regarding the changes proposed.,1215222,1,8106
For Now the design proposed looks perfect.,1215982,-1,8106
Design flow looks good.,1215701,-1,8106
"Their designs are great, but some designs may be complicated.",1217002,1,8106
The authors seem to have studied the code well and have thought of a good plan to implement the project. They also seem to follow DRY principles while adding and changing code. Also the new design flow is quite simple and easy to understand which can be implemented without any high degree of convoluted code.,1216473,-1,8106
"The proposed solution sounds good. They haven't really mentioned the changes in turn of programmer language. I couldn't visualize how are they going to make changes. They have mentioned few html.erb file but I think they would need put a good amount of work to implement the new feature. I think the team could have been more precise in their approach, for example, they could have included what all new methods they need to add or modify the existing one.",1217027,1,8106
"The design changes as described are sound, they are mostly on Javascript for the visualization and dont potentially make the code ""smelly""",1215193,-1,8106
"So far whatever is discussed seems to go in the right direction.However, not much research is done so far. I would suggest them to quickly start researching about how they are going to work and how will the technologies they plan to use work.",1215328,1,8106
The team has given a design flow that underlines the basic way in which they are planning to target the issue at hand. It can make use by giving an example as to how the output might look and the document must also describe the tools that would be used for achieving the task.,1214756,-1,8106
The design looks good enough. It mostly deals with html.erb files to accommodate the graph and some database filtering in the controllers.I do not think that the design will increase the responses time of the system. Suggestion: If the details regarding how the graph will be implemented or any gem will be used should have been given. I did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality. That too would have been useful. ,1214884,-1,8106
"No plan provided, cannot comment.",1215223,1,8106

Design flow diagram is included indicating the flow which is good.,1215702,-1,8106
"The UML diagrams is great, which is clear and easy to understand.",1217003,-1,8106
The have included a detailed design flow representation and have also included the visualizations. The could have added Lo-Fi UI cards to depict changes to views which will help them visualize the changes and also help instructors in suggesting improvements at an early stage which will help reduce unnecessary code changes in latter stages of the project.,1216474,-1,8106
One flow chart and one chart graph are included. I find the chart incomplete and confusing too. I wasn't able to relate how this is going to help real scenario. The better way would be to use a use case diagram or take example of our current class programs.,1217028,1,8106
The team has attached a bar chart for visualization which helps in understanding their purpose. Suggestion : More visual aids could have been added. The stacked bar chart as mentioned earlier . More mockups could have been added.,1215194,-1,8106
"There are no UML diagrams as such in the writeup.However, there is a flowchart which somewhat gives a clear view how they plan to do the things.",1215329,1,8106

Diagram for stacked chart missing from the design document.,1216691,1,8106
NO UML diagram,1216181,1,8106
The team has provided a flow diagram that helps to infer the structural outline of the project. The scope of the project can be perceived from the diagram.,1214757,-1,8106
A flowchart and graph has been shown in the documentation.  Suggestions: I feel that there should have been mockups of the screens where the functionality will actually appear. Team should have shown how the solution would look like on the expertiza page. There could have been use case diagrams too. ,1214885,-1,8106
Two graphs provided provide a good understanding of the process and what expected visualization should be. More diagrams would have been helpful.,1215224,-1,8106

"First of all, the doc is  not a wiki page, which does not meet the requirement",1216951,1,8076
The background and the implementation plan is provided with detail. The files to be modified for each objective of the project is also stated. Testing plan is not stated.,1215320,1,8076
The document is well written Just that a UML diagram or something similar could have been included to make it clearer and easier for the reader to understand.,1217069,-1,8087

The purpose of the project seems quite clear. The team has explicitly mentioned all the requirements that has been expected of them along with the ways to implement said requirements. There is no testing plan however. They should include that and then the document would be good to go.,1216605,-1,8076
 They showed all the details which were asked for,1215370,-1,8076

"Brilliantly written code document consisting of background, problem statement and the implementation plan. ",1215205,-1,8076
The authors have dine a good job of detailing the issues at hand and their proposed solution. UML diagrams like a flowchart could have been used to further clarify the working of the proposed design.,1216530,1,8076
The design incorporates all the functionalities that needs to be implemented. No suggestions are required.   ,1215171,-1,8076

Yes. They have included everything mentioned to implement,1217070,-1,8087
It seems that the design incorporates all of the necessary functionality. It also mentions details of how the team is going to implement said functionality.,1216606,-1,8076
Reference section missing.,1216823,1,8087
 Some more specific details could be added,1215371,1,8076

Yes.,1215206,-1,8076
"Yes, the authors have a great job of including all the needed functionality. ",1216531,-1,8076
The team has provided enough explanation about how they are going to work on this project. Overall quality of explanation is good.  Suggestion: Include the purpose of implementing these functions/changes.,1215172,1,8076
The team has proposed reasonable changes to address the problem statement in detail. The explanation justifies every change they have suggested.,1215650,-1,8076
 The changes that the author has proposed is quite inclined with the task that are expected to be completed. the author explains the the changes properly by mentioning the files that needs to updated along with the screenshots of the flow.,1215912,-1,8076
"The explanation is clear to follow but it could also include some more of the abstract design like UML diagrams, explanation of the use cases etc. ",1216073,1,8076
Looks like the team spent some time looking at the code and coming up with the solution. Good Job,1215468,-1,8076
Their explanation is adequate and easy to understand.,1216953,-1,8076
"The authors have given adequate explanation in terms of the following what is existing currently, what needs to be changed. The have also explained with a diagram the exact place where they would be adding elements to the UI. Also the files required to be changed are also mentioned. ",1215322,-1,8076
 The suggested changes seem to be appropriate. Explanation was also easy to follow.,1216874,-1,8076
The overall quality of explanations is very detailed and good. I might even take few ideas from here to improve my own design doc.,1217160,-1,8076
 The explanations seem to be okay. Couldn't fully understand what they meant by 'use proper polymorphism to handle ...' in the problem statement part 2(b)i. ,1216607,1,8076
 They have explained adequately,1215372,-1,8076
Yes very well done in explanation of changes and what needs to be done. Screen shots are helpful. good work ,1215237,-1,8076
Comprehensive.,1216382,-1,8076
"Detailed implementation plan provided, including which files they expect to change and what the output should look like",1215207,-1,8076
The authors have done a pretty good job with explaining the proposed design. They have used wire frames to show us exactly where the changes are to be made. Adding a flow chart would make things much clearer.,1216532,-1,8076
The design seems to be precise. The description of the changes are provided in detail. Team has clearly mentioned about the approach that they will use. Enough efforts have been taken by the team to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it. ,1215173,-1,8076
The team has not proposed any design for the suggested changes.,1215651,-1,8076
" As the project is more of adding features to the user interface of the website , the design plan is covering all the necessary steps that needs to be implemented",1215913,-1,8076
"The code design appears to be sound. The UI implementation as shown on the screenshot looks intuitive. However, the final implementation is necessary to say definitively that the code is not smelly ",1216074,-1,8076
"Design is good, there might be some changes when they start implementing it but its a good starting point.",1215469,-1,8076
I think their designs look complicated and there might be existing gems that can be simplified.,1216954,1,8076
The design appear to be good. Specific gems are also mentioned eg: paginate that would divide the document into discrete pages.,1215323,-1,8076
The design changes as described seem sound.,1216875,-1,8076
I don't see any trace of smells or redundancy in the proposed solution.,1217161,-1,8076
"The design seems to be sound. I would like more details on the database of the Bacui projects seeing as most of us don't know what they look like given that most of us have worked on Expertiza projects. So, a short description of the different tables the project is going to interact with along with any and all modifications would really help understand IF there will be any possibility that the design would turn out to be non-DRY or smelly.I think the team is good on what gems are to be used.",1216608,1,8076
"detailed design is missing, the document covers only the screen shots and high level overview of what needs to be done",1215238,1,8076
"Code level implementation details are not provided. But, the approach looks clean.",1216383,1,8076
No potential smells or problems found.,1215208,-1,8076
"This is one area where the authors could have improved. Even though there is a good amount of textual description and images, the authors could have added a snapshot of the code changes that they wanted to propose. This would make it clear as to the exact changes that you propose and further help answer this question.",1216533,1,8076
Screenshot explains the functionality of project very well.It is really easier to understand how the end product will look like. Suggestion: the team should include a flowchart depicting the flow of the functionality. ,1215174,1,8076
"The team has added the  mock up screens which helps to understand the proposed look and feel of the project implementation. However, there are no UML diagrams or design diagrams added for the project, due to which its difficult to understand their approach on fixing the issue.",1215652,1,8076
" Here the team has only included screenshot relating to how the UI of the system should look like which gives a idea of its appearance , However , They haven't given any UML diagrams to represent the flow of their work for example a flow chart relating to how their functionalities would co-ordinate.",1215914,1,8076
There are adequate screenshots to show the required functionalities and how they would look after implementation though there aren't any UML diagrams to explain the use cases,1216075,-1,8076
They have added a screenshot for each of the problem they plan to tackle.,1215470,-1,8076
"They show their design page as their visual aids, and their are helpful for readers to understand what their designs look like.",1216955,-1,8076
"UML diagrams are not mentioned but since these are UI changes, the changes are sufficiently explained with the help of representation of UI in terms of images.",1215324,1,8076
The whole document is easy to understand and well-written. Suggestion: It would be better to include what tools and technologies would be used in the project.,1216876,-1,8076
There were ample of visual aids to explain and walk through the proposed solution. I liked it.,1217162,-1,8076
There are mock-ups for the final result of the team's changes. However I would like some UML like diagram or some flowchart explaning how a user gets to a particular point. I don't know if it's me or maybe my lack of familiarity with the Bacui interface but I found the navigation part a bit difficult to follow.,1216609,1,8076
 UML diagrams not present but rest of the document seems feasible,1215374,1,8076
Yes screen shots are helpful but the document missing flow control diagrams ,1215239,-1,8076
Good that you have used screenshots to explain the approach. Include Use case and activity/flow diagrams also.,1216384,-1,8076
UI enhancements are provided here.,1215209,-1,8076
"They authors have used visual aids to their benefit. Even though they could have added a flow diagram, the wire frames and other screenshots they have used serve the purpose and add to the clarity of the explanation.",1216534,-1,8076
Would be good to include  high level overview of changes made in the files. ,1215705,1,8087
The author has mentioned which files have to be changed but no mention has been made of how they are going to be changed. Could have expanded a bit more on that aspect,1216154,1,8087
changes along with the screen mockup  are provided  ,1215122,-1,8087

Explained the objectives very well. Also the criteria for completion are also explained.,1215357,-1,8087
I liked the overall quality of the expalnation.,1217165,-1,8087
It explains in an overall sense what the issue is and how its going to be solved. ,1216315,-1,8087
The problem statement could have been elaborated a bit more. One line doesnt seem enough here.,1217071,1,8087
"Could have added UML diagrams, LoFi sketches and flowcharts.",1216824,1,8087
Really like the graph you guys  drawing.,1216078,-1,8087
Changes suggested look good.,1215706,-1,8087
The planned design looks complicated as there is a lot of data and variable transfer between classes. This could have been simplified a bit.,1216155,1,8087

Yes. They have included everything mentioned to implement,1217070,-1,8042
The problem statement could have been elaborated a bit more. One line doesnt seem enough here.,1217071,1,8042
They seem to have a clear idea of what they are going to do,1217072,-1,8042
"No diagrams or tables were provided. However, adding those pictures was a good idea.",1217073,1,8042
The design docs looks complete with all of the details being covered.,1217163,-1,8042
Yes design doc cover all of the functionaliites.,1217164,-1,8042
I liked the overall quality of the expalnation.,1217165,-1,8042
All the proposed changes look like exactly what needs to be implemented in this project.,1217166,-1,8042
There were few hand-made diagrams posted however I feel used of some other high-level UML diagrams and screenshots would have been better.,1217167,1,8042
The project's purpose and issues are well stated. But the project design have not been included.,1215984,1,8022
"The project design and the testing plans are well laid out. Solution part does not have any description in it, says it will be given in the detailed design. Could have given some idea on the solution with some flow diagram.",1215395,1,8022
"The project writeup is not complete at this moment, as there are a lot of things missing. Like what the team plan to do, and what concretey are its testing techniques. It only mentions the problem statement, and an overview of testing.",1217019,1,8022
Seems like all parts of the design document need more details. ,1216626,1,8022
Only problem statement is explained and nothing about how the team will design the solution. Please add design and UML diagrams.,1216390,1,8022
"The project is complete and sound enough in its approach and the implementations and the test plan has been well devised and just shy of application. Even so, in their project they lack two sections of key note, i.e. one is the project design and the solution approach.     ",1215425,1,8022
"Implementation details are missing, but the testing plan is ready. ",1216931,1,8022
UML diagrams and the solution proposed by the authors to solve the issues is missing.,1216232,1,8022
The doc clearly explains the agenda of the whole project. Seems like the team still needs time to understand and devise a plan to tackle the issues identified.,1216202,1,8022
Team have decided to give all details after final submission. A Design Doc should be available before starting the Project. I would recommend to provide few details on Project Design (classes involved in the project or application flow etc),1215847,1,8022
only the issues/problem statement is included in the documentation as of now. The tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submissions.,1215482,1,8022
"The project purpose is explained with examples but no design or plan to implement is given.  Again under the Test Plan section, a generic method is given but is not specific to the project. ",1216742,1,8022
"The design doc for now, specifies only the issues. No approach has been given yet on prospective solutions.",1215985,1,8022
"It does list out all the functionality, but there seem to be no solutions for them. Only a basic layout is present. An insight into the solutions to be implemented would be suggested.",1215396,1,8022
There is no description of what the team plans to implement.,1217020,1,8022
"All functionalities required are in the design doc, but no content is provided. ",1216627,1,8022
Please add more details about the solution.,1216391,-1,8022
"No, their sections Solution Design is blank saying everything of importance will be be provided in the final design doc. Only good thing is that they have at least a targeted section of the code which they have planned to work upon.   ",1215426,1,8022
It includes all the sections,1216932,-1,8022
The design document has mentioned the issues which need to be fixed but why these issues are occurring and what will the solution be is missing.,1216233,1,8022
"Yes, the functionality required is stated but the idea about how to code for that functionality is yet to be thought of.",1216203,1,8022
Team have decided to give all details after final submission. A Design Doc should be available before starting the Project. I would recommend to provide few details on Project Design (classes involved in the project or application flow etc),1215848,1,8022
only the issues/problem statement is included in the documentation as of now. The tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submissions.,1215483,1,8022
"Have covered almost all the issues, it would have been better if an implementation plan was provided.",1216743,1,8022
"The author hasn't mentioned any prospective changes. So, this couldn't be looked in to.",1215986,1,8022
There are no solutions proposed. Just the issues are listed and explained. A possible screenshot or a flow diagram would have been better to catch the proposed solution.,1215397,1,8022
The author has not suggested any changes as of now.,1217021,1,8022
"no implementation proposed in the design document, only placeholders. Need more detail for it. ",1216628,1,8022
No changes proposed.,1216392,1,8022
Changes are not proposed to a suitable extent as they have mostly elaborated on the problem statement.  It yet remains for them to implement them and explain in explicit details their action plan to arrive at the solution.  They have even yet to work on the most important part that is figuring out the solution. ,1215427,1,8022
"Clearly defined bugs and problem statements, but no implementation details given. So it is hard to judge this criterion",1216933,1,8022
The changes are not yet proposed.,1216204,1,8022
Did not find much info on the Design,1215849,1,8022

Author has not proposed any changes.,1216744,1,8022
"Since no solution has been proposed yet, this couldn't be reviewed.",1215987,1,8022
There were no such solutions listed on the basis of which I could suggest some better solutions. A couple of test cases or issue resolutions would have been handful for further suggestions.,1215398,1,8022
The author has not written any plans about the implementation. It only states the problem statement. The author needs to do more work in the writeup.,1217022,1,8022
"no design proposed, can not check any mistake of the design decision. ",1216629,1,8022
The team has not mentioned about how they are planning to do the changes.,1216393,1,8022
"As for the designs proposed by the authors it proves to be a redundant check since there is a minimal amount of Design aspect in their doc.  They haven't even defined an application flow.  1. Nothing about adding a method to any class has been suggested. As per them most important things are going to be given in the final doc design.  2. The design hasn't been implemented to the depth to make it a code let alone make it smelly.  3. Nothing mentioned about the design to make it complicated and the piece of code which they would delve into to ascertain of any pre-existing gems for simplification.  4. This too is hard to reach a conclusion on since not enough details to answer it with certainty.  5. Yes. Absolutely, a much more thorough investigation should be carried out and relevant previous work exploration with help solve the cause.",1215428,1,8022
"no implementation details given, so cannot say how they ",1216934,1,8022
No details of the proposed design.,1216205,1,8022
Did not find much info on the Design,1215850,1,8022
only the issues/problem statement is included in the documentation as of now. The tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submissions. No design were added in the documentation.,1215485,1,8022
No plan or UML design is given.,1216745,1,8022
This couldn't be reviewed as the design doc is incomplete.,1215988,1,8022
There are no diagrams present. It would have been great if a screenshot of a test case or flow diagram was given.,1215399,1,8022
No visual aids have been provided by the author.,1217023,1,8022
I don't think they need any visual aids.,1216364,-1,8022
no visual aids in the design document. ,1216630,1,8022
No UML diagram.,1216394,1,8022
"No diagrams, have been mentioned and they have said that they would implement a diagram in the final design doc and thus that part of the project has been left in the air.  1. No diagram present. 2. No conventional flow since no diagrams present.  3. Not only no high level but no diagrams are are even abstractly specified.",1215429,1,8022
There were no flow or UML diagrams.,1216236,1,8022
Nothing specified.,1216206,-1,8022

only the issues/problem statement is included in the documentation as of now. The tea did mention that they will be adding the detailed design in the upcoming submissions. No use of visual aids/ diagrams as of now.,1215486,1,8022
UML mockup and tables are absent. ,1216746,1,8022
The team has explained the problem statement well and detailed the implementation they plan to do. Also the appropriate test cases have been included. But I feel the team should have included more explanation in their implementation.,1214758,1,8115
The design doc outlines each step that needs to be implemented and a simple implementation plan,1216066,1,8115
"Problem, Design, and Test plan are all here. Tres bien!",1215620,-1,8115
"This design cod is fully completed, including project purpose, project design, and testing plan.",1215615,-1,8115
all necessary parts of design document are included. ,1216555,-1,8115
Could have added more explanation on the changes proposed by the team.,1216435,1,8115
"Yes, they include project purpose, project design, and testing plan. It's detailed and easy to understand.",1216767,-1,8115
The team has included everything which is required in the documentation in a comprehensive manner. The team has also included test plan for two scenarios.,1215512,-1,8115
"The project purpose. design and test plan are all explicit and detailed. Just one suggestion that the structure can be more centralized. For example, the 2.3 and 3.3 may better be together, like Overview and Details, which I think may be more specific.",1216662,-1,8115
All the required parts are in their design. ,1216802,-1,8115
Yes the team have incorporated all the functionality required.,1214759,-1,8115
"Yes, the design document mentions all the necessary steps and the design ideas for the implementation of them ",1216067,-1,8115
Explained the requiremnts well and their plan - but what they will be changing is vague,1215141,-1,8115
Design appears to account for all needed functionality.,1215621,-1,8115
"Yes, they did a great job, incorporate all of the functionality required.",1215616,-1,8115
Yes. all functionalities mentioned in the requirement are listed. ,1216556,-1,8115
Yes,1216436,-1,8115
"Yes, they include all the functionality in the wiki page.",1216768,-1,8115
The team has included solutions to all the functionalities to be implemented. ,1215513,-1,8115
Their design contains all the functionality required. ,1216803,-1,8115
"Yes, it includes all the functionality mentioned.",1217050,-1,8115
It has incorporated all the functionality.,1216663,-1,8115
i felt there was a need of adding more explanation. Add UML diagram so that it is easily understood,1216437,1,8115
The authors have done a good job listing the changes they plan to implement. But the team have not explained the changes they proposed.,1214760,1,8115
There is adequate explanation for the changes proposed along with screenshots to explain the output.,1216068,-1,8115
"The explanation is good, The images are very large on the screen and it is hard to spot the changes that you made, consider highlighting the changes to show them better.",1215814,1,8115
Solution is vaguely explained,1215142,0,8115
"nice explanation with step by step implementation plan, it is very easy to follow the design document. ",1216557,-1,8115
They explain the changes step by step. Very detailed and easy to read.,1216769,-1,8115
"The team has given a proper explanation by including the workflow/ steps that need to be achieved to solve the given issue. This shows that the team has an organized plan to implement the solutions, this will help the team in the later stages of the project.",1215514,-1,8115
An explanation for each functionality provided.,1217051,-1,8115
The explanation is complete and easy to understand.,1216664,-1,8115
"The authors have considered the requirements and accordingly designed their solutions. The proposed UI design looks very intuitive and the abstract understanding of the code seems to good. However, the implementation is required to say definitely if it makes the code smelly",1216069,1,8115
Design appears to be sound. I would do the same.,1215623,-1,8115
"no question there from my point of view, the implementation design is nice.",1216558,-1,8115
The team has not mentioned what method/s they are planning to change inside the controller.,1216438,1,8115
"From the steps taken by each tasks, I guess they can perform all the functionalities well.",1216770,-1,8115
The design they have right now looks good to me. I did not find any inappropriate design in it. ,1216805,-1,8115
The test plan seems a little vague. Maybe the scenarios can be explained in a better way first and then given in bullets.,1217052,1,8115
The desigin has many details which from my point of view is in the right direction.,1216665,-1,8115
The team have included helpful diagrams but I feel the team could have included diagrams that better helped us in understanding what the team are planning to implement. The current diagrams show us what Expertiza looks right now and that's it.,1214762,1,8115
"There are ample screenshots of the UI to help the user understand the flow of the changes made. However, there aren't any UML diagrams that explain the use cases and the design of the newly added functionalities",1216070,1,8115
As I said early the images are very very large and don't fit unless I have the wiki full screen. Also finding the changes from the original is a bit tricky. ,1215816,1,8115
Need to include uml diagrams - try t include use case diagram to explain the flow of the solution and a class diagram to explain how you will be implementing the solution.,1215144,1,8115
Images were very useful in understanding need/intent for the project.,1215624,-1,8115
There could be more visual aids to help reviewers get a better understanding of this project.,1215619,1,8115
"only screenshots of current web page, may need some diagram to show the design in the future. ",1216559,1,8115
No UML diagrams,1216439,1,8115
They have included a diagram. It do help me understand how they are going to implement this project.,1216771,-1,8115
"The team has provided screenshots to help understand the changes in the UI that need to be reflected. Moreover, the team has included proper steps in which every task is achieved.",1215516,1,8115
"The first screenshot helped me understand the design, but the second one does not help a lot. ",1216806,1,8115
No UML diagram provided,1217053,1,8115
no uml diagram,1216186,1,8115
There are screenshots that can help in understanding the purpose.,1216666,-1,8115
The team have done a good job explaining their project. But I feel the team should have detailed their explanation of the implementation more. Also more test cases should have been included in more detail.,1214763,1,8072
"The design document was clear and concise; however, I would like to see more details on how routes.rb and the views will be edited to pull static strings from the en.yml file. The test plan section is not detailed enough.",1215860,1,8072
The entire project flow is well documented along with the basic structural requirements. The document aligns with the plan of action and showcases the exact purpose of the project.,1215145,-1,8072
The project design doc is complete and specifies both issues and prospective solutions.,1216248,-1,8072
The doc mentions the changes to be made in a detailed way along with a proper stepwise explanation of the solution or the approach to be taken plus the screenshots which help in better understanding.,1215215,-1,8072
"All parts are presented, but need little fore explanation in test plan part. ",1216590,1,8072
Good work. Good documentation,1216595,-1,8072
"The document clearly specifies the problem statement. It seems good enough. They have mentioned the API they are planning to use as well as the files to be modified. However, I would like more details on this API and how they plan to integrate it into their project.",1215708,-1,8072
The document is almost complete. Includes proper planning and demonstration. Only suggestion would be to include more about how the implementation would be done. ,1214936,-1,8072
"I think technical design lacks details. the section should be more detailed on how this internationalization will work, where will the string be kept. what are the effective changes required across the project test plan should have more tests  ",1215817,1,8072
"The Design document states all the required things right from project design to test plan. The doc also specifies what all files will be changes along with how the functionality will look like once the project is deployed.  Suggestion: I feel like the test plan should have been a bit more elaborate. The team did mention one scenario. I feel like there could have been many more. But, as all the required things are present, I am giving this post full stars. ",1214921,-1,8072
"Yes, I believe they have included all of the required functionality. ",1214764,-1,8072
"The design encompasses all the features in the specification. It only indicates supporting one more language, though, whereas the design document specifies any language. It seems out of the scope of the project, but what if you used the Google's Cloud Translation API to translate the static strings at run time? Then you could support almost any language. There might be licensing issues though.",1215861,-1,8072
"Yes, The design document contains all parts of the functionality, ensuring that nothing is missed out.",1215146,-1,8072
"Yes, it covers all the functionalities.",1216249,-1,8072
The functionality scope is restricted because of the topic but the design doc covers everything what all is required to be done in the project.,1215216,0,8072
"implementation looks just like what the requirement asked for, no removing of English code.",1216591,-1,8072
Implemented major of them,1216596,-1,8072
The design does incorporate all of the necessary functionality.,1215709,-1,8072
"The document shows how they will be using the API. However, since it is initial they have not clearly mentioned the functionality required.",1214937,1,8072
yes the required functionality is adequately explained. Good work in that ,1215818,-1,8072
The design incorporates everything that the project document has specified about the project.  No suggestions.,1214922,-1,8072
The team have suggested reasonable changes to address the problem statement but have not given explanation for each solution they have proposed for the implementation.,1214765,1,8072
"The explanations are done well but they could be more thorough. Why is the internationalization API and Google Translate needed? Also, will you use a script to edit the views? How would you do that? It seems like too much work to do manually.",1215862,1,8072
The explanation provided is on point to the requirement of the project. All the steps piece up the project completely.,1215147,-1,8072
The changes are apt and easy to follow. It makes sense.,1216250,-1,8072
The explanation for changes are just an overview of what needs to be done and does not focusses on the changes to be made in the files.,1215217,1,8072
need to edit test plan and add more test cases. ,1216592,1,8072
Good explanations for all solutions,1216597,-1,8072
"The changes proposed are quite understandable. However, I would suggest them to clearly provide a clear path how they are going to reach their result. The initial planning is quite appreciable though.",1214938,0,8072
changes could be explained in details. i think that is missing a bit. ,1215819,1,8072
"The wireframes themselves make the project self-explanatory. That being said, enough explanation about how the team will tackle the problem statement has been given. Things like what API will be used to achieve the objective has been mentioned. No suggestions.",1214923,-1,8072
The design seemed good.,1214766,-1,8072
"The design looks solid, but it's hard to tell without sufficient detail. If anything, causing every static string reference to be encapsulated into an object that uses the current language to return the correct string is more DRY and maintainable than what we have now. I wonder if dynamic translation gems are out there or would work. The claim that dynamic translation should not be done in this project should be defended, e.g. it would take too much time.",1215863,-1,8072
"Looking at the doc, it seems like the design is precise. The description of the changes are provided in details ensuring the satisfaction of the reader.",1215148,-1,8072
No code is mentioned to be checked ,1215218,1,8072
"The design proposed is the natural way anyone would go around solving those issues, for example creating separate yaml files for different languages and then picking up the strings from there. ",1216251,-1,8072
"Looks good, only view files are involving the changes.",1216593,-1,8072
well designed,1216598,-1,8072
The design seems sound. The team plans to add all translations of the static variables in a separate folder. I think that this could potentially increase the response time of the system. I would like to see this design in action before making a judgement.,1215711,-1,8072
"The document does not go much into the technical details. The limited details provided sounds right. However, more research will generate better understanding.",1214939,-1,8072
Lower level design changes are missing.  Authors have only talked about config changes.  No mention if the db requires any changes ,1215820,1,8072
The team have showed what they plan to do in the diagrams.,1214767,-1,8072
The diagrams describe the functioning of the project exceptionally.,1215149,-1,8072
"The UML diagrams are missing, but they are compensated by suitable explanations. I could follow it very easily.",1216252,1,8072
No diagrams present to explain behaviour design.,1215219,1,8072
"nice mockup for another language, it is clean. The menu bar for translated language screen is still in English, I assume it is just a careless mistake when make the mockup. ",1216594,1,8072
Screenshots are helpful to understand the flow and their work,1216599,-1,8072
There are mock-ups of the end result. But there are no other UML diagrams. There should have been some UML diagrams to help explain their design better as well as the flow of the implementation.,1215712,1,8072
The only visual aid provided is the screenshot of the before and after page. More UML based diagrams could increase understandability.,1214940,1,8072
Screen mock up's are good. ,1215821,-1,8072
"No UML diagrams present.  Suggestions: Although the wireframes make it really easier to understand how the end product will look like, the team could have mentioned a use case diagram, or a flowchart depicting the flow of the functionality. ",1214925,1,8072
The team has done a fantastic job in explaining the design in the initial stage. They have the current scenario and what they plan to do in the project.,1216994,-1,8034
It is extremely detailed!! Eagerly awaiting updates on implementation and on Code Snippets as and when they happen!,1217143,-1,8034
The design document is comprehensive and detailed. However there are several parts where the team is not yet sure of what exactly they want to. The document misses out on mention which model/controller they will be making changes to.,1216677,1,8034
Nice wiki page,1215275,-1,8034
The design doc is fulfilled and written pretty well.,1215195,-1,8034
The design doc is completed and gives exact information on what authors are gonna do.,1216971,-1,8034
" This wiki is dope. They analyze the requirements for the GitHub metrics they would need, and walked the reader through their design considerations. It seems like they have a thorough understanding about how to do this project.",1216867,-1,8034
Well done on adding almost everything. ,1216400,-1,8034
The document is complete. The authors have mentioned each functionality in detail. Also the test plan in explained thoroughly.,1216445,-1,8034
"The document is well-written. They have described the plan of action along with the different routes they would need to explore in order to complete the task at hand. They also gems that can be used and API to query if gems were not allowed. They have a section called the testing plan, however that doesn't look like a traditional testing plan. It just shows the navigation path that different users would take.",1215683,1,8034
"A very well written document, great job ",1215260,-1,8034
All the required part is in the document,1216792,-1,8034
"I think the diagrams shown include where you intend to add the metrics, but not how all the metrics will be incorporated, in the next phase make sure to include details for each of these :  Total number of commits. Number of files changed. Lines of Code added Lines of code modified. Lines of code deleted. LOCs that survived until final submission - (exclude from MVP due to the complexity and lower priority). ",1216995,-1,8034
Yes. Detailed UI mockups were very impressive! The use case diagrams and explanations are well written!,1217144,-1,8034
"Yes, The document covers very required functionality.",1216678,-1,8034
Yes.,1215196,-1,8034
"Yes, it does",1216972,-1,8034
Get the GitHub pull metrics and show 'em to a person! That person being an instructor!,1216868,0,8034
Yes,1216401,-1,8034
Includes all the functionality. ,1216446,-1,8034
The design doc does mention all of the functionality that the team is supposed to implement along with the different ways they can implement the same.,1215684,-1,8034
"Yes, as far as i understand the document cover all the functionality given mentioned. all the github metrics mentioned in the requirements doc  ",1215261,-1,8034
 The design contains all of the functionality required.  ,1216793,-1,8034
"The team has proposed many changes. Although, it is not clear which approach or what exact changes they plan to make.",1216996,1,8034
The explanation was perfectly organized and flowing. Could not have been any better! A sample request response of GitHub metric API would've made it more amazing!,1217145,1,8034
"The authors do not mention the model they will be making additions to. I would suggest the team to consider a new controller, since adding new code to an existing controller may not be OO design.",1216679,1,8034
The authors proposed in a great detail.,1215197,-1,8034
Explanation is quite easy to understand.,1216973,-1,8034
" They clearly understand this software design process and Expertiza than me, so I trust their judgement.",1216869,-1,8034
Very good explanation and good work on giving alternatives. It would have been great if the team had added DB design as well but the work done is sufficient. ,1216402,1,8034
They authors have explained it well. They have also mentioned which gems eg Oktokit (Ruby toolkit for GitHub Api) that they plan on using.,1216447,-1,8034
The explanation given by the authors was pretty straightforward. Looking at the explanations it looks like the authors have thought about different aspects of the problem statement and also of different ways to implement the GitHub metrics integration feature along with the side effects of implementing it in a particular way. e.g one would think that adding the metrics to the database would be a sound solution but given the nature of an open source project and the fact that students would commit beyond the deadline the authors have thought not to add the metrics to the database which is sound and reasonable.,1215685,1,8034
very good. authors have provided all explanations with adequate screen shots and now and after screens ,1215262,-1,8034
 The team explained them design very well. It is easy to follow their idea.  ,1216794,-1,8034
They have listed various possibilities to get the task done. The Use Case and UML diagrams also help here. Suggestion : Please add the places where you want to make/have made the changes. ,1216997,1,8034
The authors mention gems that they could potentially use. but they do not mention where they'd be adding the associated code.,1216680,1,8034
No problem found. They are trying to implement the DRY principle.,1215198,-1,8034
"As far as I can tell, it does not appear that the authors will add unnecessary classes and potentially smell up the code base.",1216870,-1,8034
Design is good.,1216403,-1,8034
The design is well explained. Need clarification on below: 1) How will this GitHub metrics will be used to grade the student. So how will the final marks for a particular be calculated using the data from GitHub.,1216448,1,8034
The design seems to be good. It is still not very clear of the path for implementation or the files that they plan to add and the methods in said files however that is fine considering that this is just the initial stage and not much can be said since we haven't advanced to the implementation stage yet.  The authors seem to doubt whether they are allowed to use any existing gem. I think they should go ahead and use the gems.,1215686,1,8034
class level details are missing but i suspect that can be because this is the first phase doc. they have mentioned use of existing gems that need investigation,1215263,1,8034
 All the design looks reasonable right now.  ,1216795,-1,8034
The team has done a wonderful job in including UML diagrams and visual aids.,1216998,-1,8034
The visual aids have been well put together. ,1216681,-1,8034
The chart is also in a great detail.,1215199,-1,8034
Visual aids are present which perfectly helps us explain the plan authors have proposed.  ,1216975,-1,8034
 Super legit use case diagrams. Some of their pictures even had colours! I liked that!,1216871,-1,8034
Proper use case diagram have been added. For next submission team can add UML diagrams.,1216404,1,8034
Uses UML diagrams and images to explain where the changes will be made.,1216449,-1,8034
There are different diagrams being used: 1. Use case diagram which describes the flow of how different users would navigate to the GitHub metric pages. 2. Mockup of their implementation which details the presence of a separate tab for GitHub metrics integration. They also plan to add some graphs which i think would be very useful to the instructors.,1215687,-1,8034
Yes the doc has use case diagrams and screen shots. this is very good and eases understanding,1215264,-1,8034
 Both the use case diagram and the screenshot they provide helped me understand their purpose.  ,1216796,-1,8034
The team have done a good job explaining their problem statement and implementation. But the documentation does not include the testing plan. The team should write about the tests they plan to implement.,1216842,1,8171
"The design document describes the project's purpose and scope very well as well as the high-level design, but the details are lacking and the test plan section is missing.  ",1215870,1,8171
Well written,1216061,-1,8171
 Your background and detail of description is excellent. However without a strong background in the topic I could not figure out what a DOM was.  I don't see anything about a test plan but other wise the detail was good.,1215832,1,8171
The problem statement and what needs to be done correctly explained.,1215150,1,8171
I think they have done a great job on this doc. It complete and detailed.,1216505,-1,8171
"No test plan, but the project purpose and design are decently well explored (especially if you look at the link to the first project page). I'd recommend pulling forward the diagrams and explanation to save your readers the effort of looking in another place.",1215507,1,8171
The documentation states the purpose of the project as implementing OffScreenCanvas API for the Servo browser engine under the Problem Statement. It also includes the proposed design that specifies the flow of the project and the files that are interlinked. The testing plan has not been included in the current version of documentation. I expect that the team is working on it and will include it for the 2nd round after they start the implementation.,1215827,1,8171
It would be better if testing plan is included.,1216921,1,8171
"The document covers a number of important topics including the description of Servo, apis and concepts that are going to be used by the team in this project, problem statement, project build and proposed design. However, the testing plan is not discussed. While the instances of testing is certainly mentioned in the document, e.g. ""specific functionalities could be tested by writing a custom html file and then running it the similar way."" and ""Finally, well test our code by enabling the blob API."" the authors do not provide an extensive discussion of specifically what functionality is going to be tested. I would suggest reducing the overall size of the initial sections which provide an overview of Servo project, Off Screen Canvas, Web workers and Web IDL. They introduce more verbosity to the document than necessary. Two or three descriptive sentences could be used instead. The reader could refer to a more detailed information through references. Furthermore, the focus of the problem statement falls on the description of the OffscreenCanvas API making it somewhat redundant. It would be better to emphasize on flashing out the goal of the project and only later provide the reference to the technical details if necessary. Another suggestion would be for the team to identify and elaborate on the 'changes' that are going to be merged in servo.",1214991,1,8171
very robust! nearly cover every thing.,1215135,-1,8171
"Yes, I believe they have included all of the required functionality. ",1216843,-1,8171
The design document addresses all the functionalities and even the implementation details in the specification.,1215871,-1,8171
 looks good,1215833,-1,8171
Most of them are included.,1216506,-1,8171
"The document does say what they're going to do, and that fits fully with the project description.",1215508,-1,8171
"From my previous review of this project, there have been few additions to the set of functionalities implemented. For the 3rd project (OSS) the team had worked on OffscreenCanvas.rs (interacts with javascript) and OffscreenCanvasContextRendering2D.rs (works on OffScreenCanvas) which are implementations of OffscreenCanvas.webidl and  OffscreenCanvasContextRendering2D.webidl  (Web IDL files) respectively. In this project, the team has proposed to implement OffscreenCanvas analogous to HTMLCanvasContextRendering2D, by reusing some code from the latter and add additional functionalities. They finally propose to implement blob API, to test the contents on the canvas and also support webgl contexts as used in WebGLRenderingContext.",1215828,1,8171
The design incorporated all of the functionality required.,1216922,1,8171
"The design document covers a high level view of the required functionality. The concepts and motivations behind OffScreenCanvasContext2D are extensively discussed. Moreover, the document provides the files that are going to be changed by the team. The main problem of this design is that there is no detailed explanation or examples of what the final expectations are. I would suggest giving more specific examples of how the proposed API should work and what may be the main challenges of the implementation.",1214992,1,8171
yes,1215136,-1,8171
The team have given a proper explanation of how the things will be implemented by specifying the files that needs to be modified. The team have written it in a good manner which is easy to understand.,1216844,-1,8171
"The document needs more details on the implementation of the OffscreenCanvasContextRendering2D, the support for WebGL contexts, and the Blob API. Also, what is a DOM and a Blob? Those terms should be defined in the design document in case any readers are unfamiliar with them.      ",1215872,1,8171
 I don't know much about the topic and so it can be hard for me to judge but I would have liked a couple more pictures or other aids to understanding,1215834,1,8171
"You can mention that what are you going to do, inorder to acheive your goal. Like it is mentioned that ""As a part of the third project, weve already done with the implementation of OffscreenCanvas interface"" So how are you going to achieve the next implementation?",1215152,1,8171
Their explanations are detailed and easy to understand.,1216507,-1,8171
The design plan portion feels a bit lacking. I found myself wanting more detail about how and what they were going to copy between each implementation and the next. What's going to be filtered out? What's going to be added? I have no clue...,1215509,1,8171
The authors have proposed changes in the OffscreenCanvasContextRendering2D.webidl by implementing it similar to HTMLCanvasContextRendering2D ; implement blob API and support webgl contexts as in WebGLRenderingContext. The explanations are quite convincing though a little more detail(including background specifications) would have made the documentation more cogent. ,1215829,-1,8171
The explanation is nicely written.,1216923,-1,8171
"The relevant parts in the design doc include the listing of files that will be modified, description of OffscreenCanvasContextRendering2D and apis that need to be implemented for this class. As stated, the team is planning to use the implementation of HTMLCanvasContextRendering2D. I would suggest to elaborate on how OffscreenCanvasContextRendering2D differs from HTMLCanvasContextRendering2D and provide a better feeling for the reader of how significant those differences are.",1214993,1,8171
nearly perfect,1215137,-1,8171
"Yes, the designs appears to be good to me.",1216845,-1,8171
"The new design seems to violate the DRY principle. Copying an entire class and then editing it will likely cause problems as you will be using code you did not write and so will not understand as well as your own code. This is probably still a better design decision than writing the offscreen canvas from scratch, however, since it will take less time. Could you use delegation or extension to DRY out the implementation?",1215873,1,8171
"Their design is pretty well, but some part of that are not very detailed.",1216508,1,8171
"As stated on previous comment, the design needs more explanation. ",1215510,1,8171
" The functionalities that the authors plan to add seem logical as they plan to implement OffScreenCanvas as an efficient alternative to HTMLCanvas but with all the functionalities included.  The authors have not discussed about the implementation of the proposed design yet, which I am expecting them to do in the next review. The response time is expected to decrease with the incorporation of OffScreenCanvas because the rendering of the images in the canvas is done independently using web workers  ",1215830,1,8171
"The document should expand on the design and make specific assertions about how the changes will be propagated. So far the idea behind the design is to utilize an existing code of HTMLCanvasContextRendering2D adding new functionality like blob API on top of that. One suggestion would be to elaborate on that and discuss how the new functionality will be merged with existing code, what patterns might be used to increase the efficacy and simplicity of the system.",1214994,1,8171
the author did not add methods to wrong class.,1215138,1,8171
"No visual aids are present. Though the team have explained their work pretty well, the team should think about adding a few diagrams to better help in the understanding of the project.",1216846,1,8171
Some more visual aids would better help the reviewers understand how the Offscreen canvas context would be different to the existing environment.,1216065,1,8171
 There are no visual aids of any kind,1215836,1,8171
Try to include use case diagram to indicate your flow and a class diagram of how you'll be implementing the solution.,1215154,1,8171
The did not use any of visual aids.,1216509,1,8171
"There are no visual aids on that page, but there are some on the previous page. Some more would definitely be welcome, and should be placed on the final project wiki page.",1215511,1,8171
The authors have not included any visual aid in this document. The wiki page of their previous project documentation has a flow chart that has the code flow that shows how the control flows from higher level interface- the specifications in the WebIDL to lower level physical renderer through the intermediate implementation of OffScreenCanvas on Rust and DOM.,1215831,1,8171
It would be better to incorporate some visual aids in the design doc.,1216925,1,8171
"Unfortunately no visual aids are provided in the design. I would suggest providing the simplified UML diagram that does not necessarily capture all of the classes that interact with the ones that will be modified by the team, but the ones that the team finds will be most relevant to the reader.",1214995,1,8171
uml diagram is clear!,1215139,-1,8171
"The design doc is clean and neat. It specifies the issues and prospective solutions, which are easy to follow.",1216026,-1,8039
Yes the documentation looks complete  and states the project purpose and solution are stated . The project design could be described in more detail.,1216936,1,8039
"The project purpose seems to be only a user story, that says what's the deficiencies of te corrent issues and a terse solution. I wonder if that's comprehensive enough. I would add some more details in terms of the purpose of each function being changed in a lower level.  There' only a high-level solution , and which files to change  for the project design. They are not detailed enough. I would add some more plans in terms of how to make the change, when to do the change if the changes are inter-dependent. There's no testing plans yet. But I think that should be stated.",1214956,1,8039
 Neither the project purpose nor the testing plan or the project design is given. The project just states what are the proposed solutions. ,1215430,1,8039
"The Document mentions the problem statement, and the basic solution that team came up with to solve it. There is no reference to code or functions that might need some modification. Some design talk would be nice.",1216692,1,8039
"The design doc is disorganized and difficult to follow. There are no sections for project purpose, project design, or project testing. Consider adding these sections to give order to the document. Also, red front against a white background can be an eye strain for some.",1216580,1,8039
"I cannot find any project purpose, but they did provide a lot of solutions to problems.",1214916,1,8039
The design looks almost complete in terms of solution-wise details covered.,1217148,-1,8039
Provided link is not the wiki link. Not a good documentation,1216575,1,8039
Could have been more descriptive,1215380,1,8039
The testing plan is not proper. Though the document is nicely presented it does not concentrate on all areas. I would suggest to systematically describe each step.,1215693,1,8039
"Most of the problem statements have been addressed, just missing a test plan",1216420,1,8039
"The team states all the problems included in this project and provide the solutions for them. However, the authors didn't provide enough introduction about what the project is. The problems was not explained clear enough and tough to understand. No test plan provided.",1215390,1,8039
"The document lists all the problem and possible solutions, which is good. However, there could be more details to explain how to implement the solutions, for example, you can tell more about the changes will be made for the specific solution instead just listing the files need to be changed. Also, the testing plan should be added.",1214976,1,8039
"Yes, it incorporates all the functionalities.",1216027,-1,8039
Yes it incorporates all of the functionality required.,1216937,-1,8039
The design includes all the functionalities required in the documentation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Br9hm-SWIvl5ibWSfRVjmiYTQl5j27l8slWhv2iUCqQ/edit# the main goal: to let the TA be able to review any team that has submitted the assignment is well stated. I think some screenshots or other pictures will be more helpful while explaining the functionalities.,1214957,1,8039
" There is no design given per se but from what I can understand from the document, their proposed system covers all required issues. ",1215431,1,8039
They have covered mostly all the problems mentioned and given a tentative solution,1216693,-1,8039
Yes the design doc incorporates all of the required functionalities.,1217149,-1,8039
Yes they do incoroporate but very bad look and feel of the document and hard to understand,1216576,1,8039
The functionality needs to be explained a bit more,1215381,1,8039
"The design explains what all is to be implemented.However, there is no way it shows how it is going to be implemented.",1215694,1,8039
"The document is a little bit strange, it doesn't show what the design of the project but list the concerns during the design process. It is hard to tell if the team covers all the functions, but from those problems. I can find they design part of the functions.",1215391,1,8039
The design incorporates all of the functionality required. Some edge cases are also listed. Good job.,1214977,-1,8039
The explanations are adequate and easy to follow.,1216028,-1,8039
Explanations are satisfactory and they they have provided multiple solutions for each problem which is good,1216938,-1,8039
"The explanations are good. Separating cases to cases and discuss them one by one is a good strategy.  However, none of them is explained in detail. They are all a little bit terse. After reading it, I still have the following questions: 1. how to change the list_submissions.html.erb? What are the functions that is already implemented? The four cases in the explanation did not say clearly whether they are already implemented or not. 2. ""The feature as understood from the past project is that Assign Grade is present for all teams. (Standardize the functionality)"" I did not quite understand this sentence. What's its relation too the four cases proposed here? 3. the problem of "" response controllder checks 2 times and should be reduced to 1"", there's not a lot of detailed plan in this implementation.    ",1214958,1,8039
 The explanations given for the design are quite succinct and dont go into much details. They are just giving a high level overview of the system. Some of the explanations are thorough in nature. Kudos!,1215432,-1,8039
"Changes proposed are adequate, but without any reference to code or design diagrams its hard to tell if the proposed solution will work. It is always better to investigate the code instead of writing states such as this ""Maybe the legacy code is in two places hence the two calls""",1216694,1,8039
"Thye provided a lot of solutions, which is great.",1214918,-1,8039
Adequate explanation is provided for each problem. ,1217150,-1,8039
I find the information and solutions provided inadequate as they fail to explain me the solution. also missing diagrams,1216577,1,8039
"Since, they have not come up with a perfect solution, it seems they have been working on that.",1215382,-1,8039
"The authors clearly explain about the issues and possible solutions. However, there is no description about the technical aspect and what all tools will be used.",1215695,1,8039
"Changes are adequately explained, easy to follow.",1216422,-1,8039
"The intended changes are not stated clearly. Some solutions are also ambiguous, the team only said that they would change some files or look more codes, but they didn't say how they will change.",1215392,1,8039
"The author seems not sure about exactly what solution they need to use (problem 5). Except that, everything is clear.",1214978,1,8039
"Though, the solutions proposed are at a very high level, it does make sense. I can't comment on the actual implementation because there isn't much info on that.",1216029,-1,8039
"5), More effort should be expended on the design. The solution is too high-end, abstract. Also, some screenshots being added would be a lot more helpful. And addressing the above issues will also increase the readability",1214959,1,8039
 The design is quite robust however more effort could be given to the design analysis. In some places the author just states that they might have to look into the code.,1215433,1,8039
"Proposed solution is correct, but as i have said in other comments, there should be a design present.",1216695,1,8039
"There is an ""Assign grade"" link for everyone, but only ""Perform review"" for certain teams.  But why doesn't ""Perform review"" appear for everyone? Or at least ""Update review"". (Not if a review has been submitted, at least until the next round starts.)  [This was confusing!  Do something that's clearer.]   Sol : The feature as understood from the past project is that  Assign Grade is present for all teams. (Standardize the functionality) Case 1 : No review performed yet -> Perform Review button Case 2 : Review Started -> View Review button, Edit Review button  Case 3 : Review Submitted, Deadline not crossed -> View Review button Case 4 : Review Submitted, Deadline crossed -> Update Review button   Lets always have view review button once review has started, + change the update review name to edit (only available for instructors and TAs) itself that should be clear i hope. We will make changes in list_submissions.html.erb   Comments: Case 3 and 4 buttons should be switched. If the deadline has been crossed, you should have the option to view the review. Otherwise, you should be able to edit the review.",1216583,1,8039
No problem found.,1214919,-1,8039
It looks more or less right in the sense that the proposed changes are exactly what is required to be done in the project.,1217151,-1,8039
Nothing related to technical part or classes is mentioned,1216578,1,8039
The flow seems feasible,1215383,-1,8039
"As the project is in the initial stage, there is no technical description.However, I see from the document that their thought process is on the right track. ",1215696,-1,8039
The new design seems to take into account decreasing response time,1216423,-1,8039
There are not enough information to help me understand what the design looks like.,1215393,1,8039
"The design seems pretty good, but the solutions are a little bit unspecific. It would be better if there are more explanations about how to implement the solutions so that the reviews can give you more feedback. ",1214979,1,8039
Everything has been described well and in details.,1217004,-1,8081
"at current state, the design doc has project problem, project solution, and design diagram, and each section has detailed description of the project. ",1216480,-1,8081
The document is well structured and provides all required information. ,1215285,-1,8081
"The design doc is well written , but they haven't specified any test plans. They've explained the steps well, but haven't written anything about tests.",1216370,1,8081
"There is no mention of testing, also code change related details have not been included. Otherwise the document is very good.",1216520,1,8081
"test plan is specified, but UML is missing. They have added the ER diagram though, which i don't think is required here.",1216712,1,8081
The document explains what was asked for,1215375,-1,8081
"The document clearly states what is missing and how they are planning to implement that thing , they state how many new criterion are they going to add to the search feature, However, I would suggest them to include how will they implement it. There is no explanation of how things will be done.",1215350,1,8081
The design document gives a clear picture of the intended functionality of the project but it should have included test cases or what would be tested.,1215758,1,8081
The design document describes the problem statement and the expected flow. But the approach section doesn't have any technical implementation details. It just explains the flow that is going to be implemented. Test plan is missing.,1216425,1,8081
"Project purpose and the proposed solution is defined in the documentation. However, the test plan is not stated in the documentation.",1215067,1,8081
"The project purpose and possible solutions are clearly described in this design doc. However, the author only talked about the solution but no exactly what they need to do to implement the solutions. Also, there is no testing plan.",1214986,1,8081

"All functions required are stated in the design document, which include search for user, assignment, questionnaire, and reviews. ",1216481,-1,8081
Yes.,1215286,-1,8081
"Yes, they've included all functionalities.",1216371,-1,8081
The design document covers all the possible cases and should be fine.,1216521,-1,8081
Yes it does. They have explained the propose solution as well for each issue.,1216713,-1,8081
"Yes, almost everything seems perfect, only a little more explaination is required",1215376,-1,8081
The writeup does not talk about the functionalities . However they include what is missing and what they will include.,1215351,1,8081
The design incorporates all the basic functionality.,1215759,-1,8081
"Yes, almost all types of search functionalities are covered.",1216426,-1,8081
The design implements all the defined functionality elaborately.,1215068,-1,8081
"Yes, the design incorporates all of the functionality required and also gives the possible solutions.",1214987,-1,8081
The quality of explanation is good and adequate.,1217006,-1,8081
search questionnaire and search reviews don't have detailed explanation of what should be done.,1216482,1,8081
"The explanations seem very clear. Although, splitting the ER diagram into 1 or 2 more sections would have made the design simple to understand in my opinion.",1215287,1,8081
"The explanation of changes is good enough that it states what all needs to be added/re-implemented, but it does not elaborate on some technical aspects.",1216372,1,8081
it could be better if you tell in which files you'll be making those changes and if you'll create new functions or make change in existing functions.,1216714,1,8081
"The authors have proposed changes that they are planning to implement. However, they have not included how they will go on to implement these changes. ",1215352,1,8081
The changes proposed are good and clearly meet the objectives of the project.,1215760,-1,8081
Team has given information on how it will work after the the project is done. Could have given more detail on Design using UML diagrams and Files invovled in the Project,1215854,1,8081
Good explanations. Easy to follow.,1216427,-1,8081
"The changes proposed by the authors are elaborate overall. They have defined the changes extensively. However, the ""Search for Reviews"" section could have elaborated more about the search functionality. The authors could have explained what could be searched and how the search functionality can be used a little more elaborately. ",1215069,1,8081
"The authors explain the project pretty well, they also provide a diagram to show the relationship between different sets. However, the solution can be more detailed and maybe cover some edge cases.",1214988,1,8081
"Code snippets are not mentioned, but design is properly done.",1215288,1,8081
"Overall, the design proposed seems good.",1216373,-1,8081
They didn't add the code change details or the files in which they might work. That's still fine as those details can be filled once the implementation is done.,1216523,1,8081
can't say in what file they'll make change as its not specified in the document. You can add what changes you'll be making and explain a little more for better understanding.,1216715,1,8081
"Yes, the changes are completely feasible",1215378,-1,8081
"The authors do not talk much about the technical aspects of how they are going to implement their work. The new design they proposed however seem to go on the right track. However, not much research is done till now.",1215353,1,8081
"The author has not yet presented how the work is going to be done, as work on the project might not have started yet.",1215761,1,8081
"Did not see much info on the files or classes the changes proposed, so its hard to comment here",1215855,-1,8081
Code level details are not covered in this doc. But the high-level approach looks fine to me.,1216428,-1,8081
The authors have added the methods in the right classes. The new design is properly refactored and the gems are relevantly used. The new design might potentially increase the response time of the system because of advanced search option.,1215070,1,8081
"The authors need to provide more detailed procedures about how they going to implement their solutions, instead of the results after they done it.",1214989,1,8081
Yes they have provided an UML diagram which follows convention and explains their approach,1217008,-1,8081
"The diagram show relationships between different models involve in the project, helped to give a clear vision of what should be implement. But no implementation design is visible. ",1216484,1,8081
The team has added sufficient diagrams for the reader,1215289,-1,8081
The diagrams are succinct and well-understood.,1216374,-1,8081
"The ER Diagram is very well done. It encompasses all the classes and their attributes. Also the use of different shapes like diamond, square etc is great. ",1216524,-1,8081
uml is missing but er diagram is given. you can add a uml diagram it explains things better. ,1216716,-1,8081
The E-R diagram seems to deliver the task,1215379,-1,8081
Not required for this project,1214798,-1,8081
"They have depicted their working strategy through an ER diagram. However, I would suggest them to include more UML diagrams to enhance understandability. Also, the ER diagram is somewhat incomplete.",1215354,-1,8081
There is an ER diagram which defines the relationships in the system.,1215762,-1,8081
"I feel the diagram is more complex, team could have gone with some usecase/UML/CRC diagrams",1215856,1,8081
Just one ER diagram. Add use case and activity/flow diagrams.,1216429,1,8081
"The authors have visually represented the system by depicting the method through an ER diagram. However, the diagram is a little high level and does not completely explain the flow of the system.",1215071,1,8081
"There is an ER diagram helps the reviewer understand the relationship between different sets. Maybe more screenshot can be provided to show where is the search bar, etc.",1214990,1,8081
"Document is very well written and contains all the details like problem statement, solution, files to be modified, testing plan.",1215630,-1,8025
The write-up is very minimal. I think it should elaborate made ,1217074,1,8025
"The project purpose is stated in detail, in the Introduction part. Starting from the background and problem statement ( to improve the quality of report views""). The purpose is stated in five different small goals separately: make changes in view submissions, view scores, view review report, author feedback report and teammate review report five different parts. In terms of project purpose, it's comprehensive and detailed. As for project design, it is carefully outlined in the ""Solution"" and ""Modification of files"" part. I think the project design might needs a bit more description, in terms of what steps needs to do first, and what steps needs to be done next. It seems that all the changes are for the UI, but is there any UI that can be served as a pattern, for the usage of others? Or is there any implementation of one UI dependent on the implementation of another? Here, I think there needs to be more detailed steps. The testing plan includes detailed steps in terms of how to test the implementation as a  end user. I like it very much because it is both succinct and very intuitive. It will be good to add some sample pictures when the project is over and some pictures that display the functionality becomes available.",1214931,1,8025
"It says what they will do, but it seems high level. Would appreciate some diagrams or mockups",1214839,1,8025
"The team has done a good job in listing down the project requirements and design. However I suggest the testing plan be improved. In place of giving steps on how a reviewer should test the project, the team should instead list how they wish to write tests for the functionality added, for example-: list down a dummy set of data in any one report view, mention how they would like to write a test for this. Say using capybara, and then how to corroborate the result from the view.",1216375,1,8025
The doc seems complete. All aspects of the problem statement are covered and test plan is also included. A use-case diagram will be useful to add.,1216450,-1,8025
Design doc contains everything in clear explanation,1216116,-1,8025
The authors can add the project's purpose (why this feature is important/helpful). The authors have mentioned the plan to use tablesorter jQuery to sort the table but No design plan is included. I suggest the team to remove the introduction to expertiza since it was clearly mentioned in the requirements to not include it.,1215255,1,8025
"The design doc for now, specifies only the issues. No approach has been given yet on prospective solutions  ",1216631,1,8025
"The design document has clearly mentioned the problem statement and the subtasks that need to be performed. However, it looks a bit incomplete to me. Suggestions: Try adding what were your proposed approaches and a clear reasoning as to why did you choose a particular approach. You can simply remove the statement on Expertiza, as the professor has clearly advised us to avoid doing it.  ",1214926,1,8025
"The design document is comprehensive and covers most of the relevant topics. General problem statement is defined clearly and then divided into multiple specific subtasks which will be addressed by the project. The solution to the problem specifies the library that will be utilized in the implementation and classifies several types of sorting that needs to be done. This is followed by the files that will be modified in the scope of this project. The primary problem is that the document does not provide any extensive discussion about the possible design decisions and implementation strategies. It is stated that scripts have been added at the top of the file to sort the contents of table. I would suggest elaborating on the specifics, what functions are called and how will the javascript function be tied to the html table contents.",1215225,1,8025
"The team provided sufficient information on the project purpose and design. The test plan is adequate.        It would be better, to provide a solid reasoning for incorporating different sorting. Few sorting implementations, ie) by name and team are intuitive. But the need to sort the Author feedback report and teammate review report, in the way suggested by the team, the reasoning is not very apparent. Need more problem statement elaboration.  ",1216021,1,8025
"The document mentions the tools of JQuery sorting table, in fact which API or any sample code that can be referenced to is expected in the document. Also, this project seems to focus on the view part of Expertiza, so the test plan should be more detailed, cover more edge case. ",1216732,1,8025
It incorporates all the functionalites.,1215631,-1,8025
"Though the pull request has been passed, but the writeup does not explain the details of the implementation, like what sorting algorithm the team has implemented using jQuery etc. The design part of the writeup is very hollow, and needs further refinement.",1217075,1,8025
"Yes, all the functionalities, including viewing submission, viewing scores, viewing review report, author feedback report, teammate review report are all available. I believe a more intuitive, detailed explanation or description might be even more useful, while describing the functionalities in the design. Here, such design is still just simply stated as the project goal.",1214932,1,8025
The wiki is detailed enough that it mentions all the functinoalities required in the project. The team has made sure to not miss out on any functionality and they even took out time to list the column names in each report they would add the sort feature to. Good work guys.,1216376,-1,8025
I think the authors have incorporated most of the functionality in the design document.,1216451,-1,8025
Design document contains all the functionality required.,1216117,-1,8025
Please add more details about the solution. How to code for that functionality is yet to be thought of.,1216632,1,8025
"Yes, as per the solution provided, it does seem that the design incorporates the required functionality. It considers sorting on all the specified fields. Suggestions: Since you have mentioned the use of jQuery tablesorte, you may also add explanation as to what is tablesorter and try explaining atleast for one field (e.g. name) as to how does it work to sort the entries.    ",1214927,1,8025
"The design document lists every issue that is being addressed in the project, providing comprehensive details on the functionality that is required for each one.",1215226,-1,8025
" Yes, their design seems to cover all the intended functionality requested for the project. But how the team will achieve the few not so straight-forward sorting such as the one indicated in Author feedback report is not clear to conclude, their approach will achieve the intended functionality    ",1216022,1,8025
Changes look good.,1215632,-1,8025
"The explaiantions provided by the author are at a very high level view, and needs further drilling down into the implementation.",1217076,1,8025
"The changes being proposed including the modification of 6 files: submission, team title, view, review-report, feedback report, and teammate review report. I think the lists of modifications are comprehensive. But more details needs to be stated: How should we change this list_submissions.html.erb file? Should we only change some lines or should we change the entire pattern? In which file will the sorting be implemented? there does have information on how to sort by JQuery, but there's not yet information, in terms of which file, which part needs to be changed.  ",1214933,1,8025
could use more detail,1214841,1,8025
"The proposed changes section of the wikipedia clearly mentions the column names the team would implement sort on. But, how they want to implement the sort could be explained a little more in detail. They mention they would use tablesorter JQuery, but I would suggest to add some sort of a pseudocode that would explain better how exactly does the sorting work.",1216377,1,8025
It is easy to follow the changes that the authors have proposed.,1216452,-1,8025
Adequate explanation was given,1216118,-1,8025
The explanations can be more detailed. Overall understandable.,1215257,-1,8025
Solutions have been proposed. How they are going to do that is not mentioned.,1216633,1,8025
Team have shared the link for the TableSorter which explains the functionality,1215839,-1,8025
The authors have taken efforts to identify the right places for making the identified changes. It seems that they have already done some changes. Suggestions: I feel that the proposed changes on a high level. You might want to go a level deeper to explain what will your changes be like. You might also consider adding use case for your changes. ,1214928,1,8025
The authors provide a list of files that will be modified in the scope of this project and a high level overview of what needs to be done. The rationale behind using a tablesorter jQuery library and defining the code in the script seems reasonable but the team needs to discuss more details to further clarity the solution. ,1215227,1,8025
"It states the internal jQuery library they plan to use to achieve the sorting, again more details on implementations are required to be documented to assess the quality of the solution.",1216023,1,8025
need some diagram or prototype. ,1216734,-1,8025
Mainly needs html files to be changed and they have mentioned them which looks good ,1215633,-1,8025
"As mentioned above, the design part is pretty weak for a writeup, and needs to be further worked upon.",1217077,1,8025
"I believe more effort should be expended on the design. Currently, it is still not so comprehensive. A lot of details can be added in terms of how each file should be modified and how the sorting will be implemented.",1214934,1,8025
"The design proposed by the authors appears to be sound. Since this project is only to sort the views, there will be no code added to either the models or controllers. I hope the team only adds one sorting function per view and allows that one function to handle sorting for different columns in that view.",1216378,-1,8025
"I don't think the authors plan to add methods to the wrong class. They are modifying the right files. The new design does not appear to potentially make the code ""smelly"". The team is using one of the existing gems in their design.",1216453,-1,8025
"The solution looks like it doesnt add any overhead and the doesnt make the code ""smelly""",1216119,-1,8025
The solution seems right.,1215258,-1,8025
The team has not mentioned about how they are planning to do the changes.,1216634,-1,8025
"I think that the authors have identified changes in the html.erb files, which looks right to me. As it only deals with the sorted view of instructor reports, the changes must go in the views part of the application.  Suggestion: You can try to add a bit of information on whether your changes include addition of new code, deletion of existing code, or just slightly modifying or extending the existing code and justify it. Query: Do you plan on creating  a drop-down like option to choose from which type of sorting is to be performed? If yes, it is an add-on user-friendly feature.",1214929,1,8025
"The authors talk about adding the tablesorter class to the html table and using javascript scripts for further action. There are no apparent problems with this strategy, however I would suggest for the team to elaborate and provide more details on the implementation. For example, it is not possible to understand what the javascript part will look like, how many functions will be used or how they will interact with html.",1215228,1,8025
"1)     The team has already identified the files to be changed, which is a good thing. It looks like, all changes will be handled in the client-side, so not applicable 2)     I assume, as it is nowhere mentioned, they would be writing a custom js file, the team plans to repeat some of the custom written code, if same functionality is required in 2 different file, which could violate DRY. Team might need to consider such possibility. 3)     NO, the team is already optimizing by leverage some JavaScript libraries. 4)     It would as user opts to sort, but here it seems to be a necessary evil. 5)     Yes, the team can elaborate more on their design approach and provide visual aids to help reader understand the sorting intended better.    ",1216024,1,8025
how to encapsulate that sorting table for future use?,1216735,1,8025
No UML diagram.,1215634,1,8025
"The author has not used any UML diagram, nor any other forms of pictorial representation. ",1217078,1,8025
"Although the textual explanation is succinct and nice, there's not yet diagrams or other visual aids available. I think a diagram that depicts the workflow might be very helpful.",1214935,1,8025
no visuals at all,1214843,1,8025
"Unfortunately the team has missed out on adding any visual aids to the document. I would suggest that where you list all the column names which would be sorted in each view, also add a screenshot of how that view looks at the present moment, and a low-fi sketch of how the view would look after the changes have been implemented.",1216379,1,8025
"The authors have not included any diagrams. Though the purpose and proposed changes are understood, the team could have mentioned use case diagrams or a flow chart explaining the flow of the functionality.",1216454,1,8025
"Although screenshots are available on the Projects page, it would have been easier to visualize if the page mockups were added in the design document too.",1216120,1,8025
No use of any visual aids.,1215259,1,8025
There are no diagrams present. It would have been great if a screenshot of a test case or flow diagram was given.,1216635,1,8025
Did not find any diagrams in the Wiki.,1215841,1,8025
"Although the write-up explains the things clearly, visual aids will leverage your proposed changes. Suggestions: You can include UML diagrams like use cases, application flow to elaborate more on your additional changes. You can mock the changes ( editing html page to show proposed changes) which will really help in a better understanding of your design.      ",1214930,1,8025
"Unfortunately no visual aids are provided in the design. I would suggest providing the simplified UML diagram that does not necessarily capture all of the classes that interact with the ones that will be modified by the team, but the ones that the team finds will be most relevant to the reader.",1215229,1,8025
NO UML diagram,1216025,1,8025
The design data includes most of the important information required to understand the teams plan.,1214824,-1,8033
The doc seems complete. All aspects of the problem statement are covered and test plan is also included. A UML diagram may prove to be useful.,1216031,-1,8033
" This seems complete to me. They have the introduction with a purpose and problem, a ui mockup, and use cases. It does seem odd that the use cases are listed in the test plan.",1216787,1,8033
Good job on UI and test cases. Kindly add UML diagram.,1215625,-1,8033
"The project documentation looks complete with clear details about the purpose- to enable the students to better analyze their review based on the suggestion metrics (like volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics). They have delineated the design that includes the files that the team proposes to change (the view- app/views/response/response.html.erb and the partial app/views/submitted_content/_self_review.html.erb), the screenshot of the existing UI of the review section and how the UI would look after the project with the inclusion of a button to analyze and they have specified that a popup displaying the suggestion metrics will emerge when the button is clicked.  I specifically like how the Test plan includes their feature in the Connextra format. They have mentioned 2 scenarios- one where the student clicks the button without entering text in which case the popup alerts the reviewer saying no text for analysis and the regular scenario when the user clicks the analyze button after entering text in which case the popup displays the suggestion metrics. I wish to suggest an additional scenario where the user can intuitively test the quality of the suggestion metrics, based on the review input. Like for example, there can be test cases which show that the suggestion algorithm detects generic reviews that might be seemingly relevant to the topic but add no customization to the project being reviewed (like how some reviewers menially copy paste the same format of the review to all projects with just minor changes). Overall the team has done a great job with the documentation and I look forward to see the implementation of this project in the upcoming review.  ",1215865,-1,8033
"The design document contains some extra information, such as a whole paragraph about expertiza, which I think can be skipped and more importance should be put on the design part.",1216430,1,8033
"The design doc is clean and neat. It specifies the issues and prospective solutions, which are easy to follow.",1216026,-1,8028
Yes the documentation looks complete  and states the project purpose and solution are stated . The project design could be described in more detail.,1216936,-1,8028
"The project purpose seems to be only a user story, that says what's the deficiencies of te corrent issues and a terse solution. I wonder if that's comprehensive enough. I would add some more details in terms of the purpose of each function being changed in a lower level.  There' only a high-level solution , and which files to change  for the project design. They are not detailed enough. I would add some more plans in terms of how to make the change, when to do the change if the changes are inter-dependent. There's no testing plans yet. But I think that should be stated.",1214956,1,8028
 Neither the project purpose nor the testing plan or the project design is given. The project just states what are the proposed solutions. ,1215430,1,8028
"The Document mentions the problem statement, and the basic solution that team came up with to solve it. There is no reference to code or functions that might need some modification. Some design talk would be nice.",1216692,1,8028
"The design doc is disorganized and difficult to follow. There are no sections for project purpose, project design, or project testing. Consider adding these sections to give order to the document. Also, red front against a white background can be an eye strain for some.",1216580,1,8028
"I cannot find any project purpose, but they did provide a lot of solutions to problems.",1214916,-1,8028
The design looks almost complete in terms of solution-wise details covered.,1217148,-1,8028
Provided link is not the wiki link. Not a good documentation,1216575,1,8028
Could have been more descriptive,1215380,1,8028
The testing plan is not proper. Though the document is nicely presented it does not concentrate on all areas. I would suggest to systematically describe each step.,1215693,1,8028
"The team states all the problems included in this project and provide the solutions for them. However, the authors didn't provide enough introduction about what the project is. The problems was not explained clear enough and tough to understand. No test plan provided.",1215390,1,8028
"The document lists all the problem and possible solutions, which is good. However, there could be more details to explain how to implement the solutions, for example, you can tell more about the changes will be made for the specific solution instead just listing the files need to be changed.

"Yes, it incorporates all the functionalities.",1216027,-1,8028
Yes it incorporates all of the functionality required.,1216937,-1,8028
The design includes all the functionalities required in the documentation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Br9hm-SWIvl5ibWSfRVjmiYTQl5j27l8slWhv2iUCqQ/edit# the main goal: to let the TA be able to review any team that has submitted the assignment is well stated. I think some screenshots or other pictures will be more helpful while explaining the functionalities.,1214957,1,8028
" There is no design given per se but from what I can understand from the document, their proposed system covers all required issues. ",1215431,1,8028
They have covered mostly all the problems mentioned and given a tentative solution,1216693,-1,8028
Yes.,1214917,-1,8028
Yes the design doc incorporates all of the required functionalities.,1217149,-1,8028
Yes they do incoroporate but very bad look and feel of the document and hard to understand,1216576,1,8028
The functionality needs to be explained a bit more,1215381,1,8028
"The design explains what all is to be implemented.However, there is no way it shows how it is going to be implemented.",1215694,1,8028
"The document is a little bit strange, it doesn't show what the design of the project but list the concerns during the design process. It is hard to tell if the team covers all the functions, but from those problems. I can find they design part of the functions.",1215391,1,8028
The design incorporates all of the functionality required. Some edge cases are also listed. Good job.,1214977,-1,8028
The explanations are adequate and easy to follow.,1216028,-1,8028
Explanations are satisfactory and they they have provided multiple solutions for each problem which is good,1216938,-1,8028
"The explanations are good. Separating cases to cases and discuss them one by one is a good strategy.  However, none of them is explained in detail. They are all a little bit terse. After reading it, I still have the following questions: 1. how to change the list_submissions.html.erb? What are the functions that is already implemented? The four cases in the explanation did not say clearly whether they are already implemented or not. 2. ""The feature as understood from the past project is that Assign Grade is present for all teams. (Standardize the functionality)"" I did not quite understand this sentence. What's its relation too the four cases proposed here? 3. the problem of "" response controllder checks 2 times and should be reduced to 1"", there's not a lot of detailed plan in this implementation.    ",1214958,1,8028
 The explanations given for the design are quite succinct and dont go into much details. They are just giving a high level overview of the system. Some of the explanations are thorough in nature. Kudos!,1215432,-1,8028
"Changes proposed are adequate, but without any reference to code or design diagrams its hard to tell if the proposed solution will work. It is always better to investigate the code instead of writing states such as this ""Maybe the legacy code is in two places hence the two calls""",1216694,1,8028

"Changes are adequately explained, easy to follow.",1216422,-1,8028
"The intended changes are not stated clearly. Some solutions are also ambiguous, the team only said that they would change some files or look more codes, but they didn't say how they will change.",1215392,1,8028
"The author seems not sure about exactly what solution they need to use (problem 5). Except that, everything is clear.",1214978,1,8028
"5), More effort should be expended on the design. The solution is too high-end, abstract. Also, some screenshots being added would be a lot more helpful. And addressing the above issues will also increase the readability",1214959,1,8028
"There is an ""Assign grade"" link for everyone, but only ""Perform review"" for certain teams.  But why doesn't ""Perform review"" appear for everyone? Or at least ""Update review"". (Not if a review has been submitted, at least until the next round starts.)  [This was confusing!  Do something that's clearer.]   Sol : The feature as understood from the past project is that  Assign Grade is present for all teams.

We will make changes in list_submissions.html.erb   Comments: Case 3 and 4 buttons should be switched. If the deadline has been crossed, you should have the option to view the review. Otherwise, you should be able to edit the review.",1216583,1,8028
No problem found.,1214919,-1,8028
It looks more or less right in the sense that the proposed changes are exactly what is required to be done in the project.,1217151,-1,8028
Nothing related to technical part or classes is mentioned,1216578,1,8028

"As the project is in the initial stage, there is no technical description.However, I see from the document that their thought process is on the right track. ",1215696,-1,8028
The new design seems to take into account decreasing response time,1216423,-1,8028
There are not enough information to help me understand what the design looks like.,1215393,1,8028
"The design seems pretty good, but the solutions are a little bit unspecific. It would be better if there are more explanations about how to implement the solutions so that the reviews can give you more feedback. ",1214979,1,8028
"The UML diagrams are missing, but they are compensated by the sequence of steps, which is easy to follow.",1216030,1,8028
No visual aid present in the doc but they have given a link which provides visual help,1216940,1,8028
"There's no visual aids.  I think other than a screenshot of a finalized result possible, a workflow diagram will also be useful the work design.",1214960,1,8028
 Visual aids are missing entirely. No class diagrams are provided either. Tip: you could've provided simple charts or ER diagrams for the design,1215434,1,8028
There aren't many visual aids used. It may be a good idea to do some mockups for this project.,1216584,1,8028
There is no visual aid.,1214920,1,8028
I liked that instead of stating all the problems at once and then stating their solutions the design doc tackles in one at a time. Still there wsa no visual aid provided for the project.,1217152,1,8028
No visuals are us,1216579,1,8028
The purpose of the project is very clear and well outlined. The project design seems to be barely mentioned. There have been mentions of the word 'API' but not which one. So reading the doc I have no clue of how they are going to implement this. However I do know the files that they are going to modify. The test plan has been written in the form of cucumber user stories. I am not entirely sure if it is the correct approach.,1216121,1,8033
The design doc is complete and clearly indicates the project objectives. The test plan indicates what aspects are to be tested and screenshots of the proposed analyze button are also posted.,1215718,-1,8033
Project purpose and testing plan are nicely explained in the design doc. It would be better if the project design is more elaborateive.,1216862,1,8033
"The document specifies the problem statement and the ""analyze"" functionality they want to incorporate. However, the design document seems to be incomplete as they have not talked about the exact identified functionality i.e ""analyze"" and the design document section is empty. Suggestion : You can talk about methods you want to add or existing methods you want to modify and how. I think that you can remove the expertiza introduction section as mentioned by the professor.    ",1216852,1,8033
The document is complete and very clear.,1217153,-1,8033
The doc is complete and everything is included. Very well-written,1216207,-1,8033
The design document gives details about the problem statement and gives an idea about what is to be done in the project. It specifies what files will be modified and the test plan also contains 2 scenarios mentioned. No suggestions.  ,1214946,-1,8033
The design document mentions nothing about evaluation of how long the API takes to return with a JSON.,1214825,1,8033
"Yes, I think the document includes everything as expected.",1216032,-1,8033
" Yes, the wiki appears to incorporate all of the required functionality. We want students to know if they're giving helpful feedback, and we want the NLP algorithm to be local to the Expertiza project to decrease its reaction time. They have at least shown that they are going to add buttons. ",1216788,-1,8033
Few information is missing like specification on NLP and how exactly the implementation would be. Idea is fine but add more details to it.,1215626,1,8033
I could not spot the problem statement of the proposed project in the Google doc containing the list of Problem statements. But on reading the team's design documentation on the wiki page I'm quite satisfied with the functionality that they plan to include. In addition to elucidating the main functional requirement of the project namely- the implementation of the suggestion algorithm the team has also proposed a non-functional requirement of improving the performance and response time of the time it takes to generate the suggestion through the web service.,1215866,-1,8033
"Yes, the design document incorporates the plan to implement the functionalities as stated in the problem statement.",1216431,-1,8033
yes all changes are incorporated and explained well.,1216728,-1,8033
As mentioned before the document is good for most of the part except that key aspects of the implementation are missing which leaves me wondering about how exactly they are going to do this. I would like more details on this so called 'API',1216122,1,8033
The design incorporates most of the functionality required. It would be nice to have a design diagram.,1215719,-1,8033
The design incorporates most of the functionality but it would be better if the actual design is discussed more clearly.,1216863,1,8033
"The authors have provided a high level solution to the problem statement.  They have mentioned that they are going to use an API for suggestion detection, but have not yet identified one. Suggestion: You can survey on the existing APIs and discuss about at least two of them in depth and specify which one you feel is more compatible with expertiza. This will improve your write-up significantly.",1216853,1,8033
"Yes, they have discussed about all the functionality",1217154,-1,8033
Yes. ,1216208,-1,8033
The design document incorporated all the functionalities that the project is supposed to be implementing.  No suggestions. ,1214947,-1,8033
"The authors have mentioned including 'Analyze' buttons for sentiment analysis of different parts of the comments. I think the rationale for this is very good because if they were to send all of the comments at once as input to the API, the results would be a mix of the sentiments of all the different comments and would therefore not be accurate. Also this way, I think that the response time of the system would not be affected by a whole lot.",1216123,-1,8033
The explanation is good and clearly indicates the project objectives.,1215720,-1,8033
The explanation of how the received data will be stored/presented is something I would suggest the team to add. The design document also misses out on where the data will be presented in the view.,1214826,1,8033
I am able to understand the purpose of the project.,1216033,-1,8033
Please add more information on the NLP algorithm team is trying to use.,1215627,-1,8033
"The team has has listed the 2 files that they propose to change namely - the view- app/views/response/response.html.erb and the partial app/views/submitted_content/_self_review.html.erb. However, they could have described what these files currently do and their purpose in the documentation. The authors have embedded screenshots of how the UI of the review page will look after the Analyze button will be included. They have specified that a pop up showing the suggestion metrics pertaining to a review namely - volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics will be generated once the button is clicked.",1215867,-1,8033
"The explanation is pretty good, I particularly found the images explaining what all they are going to add pretty intuitive.",1216432,-1,8033
changes are explained well. suggestion detection algorithm an be explained a bit more or how exactly you will be using it. probably some code snippets would help explaining that.,1216729,-1,8033
The current explanation talks only about changes in the view. It would be better if the solution is explained at greater depth.,1216864,1,8033
The team has done a fantastic job in explaining the design in the initial stage. They have the current scenario and what they plan to do in the project.,1216994,-1,8024
It is extremely detailed!! Eagerly awaiting updates on implementation and on Code Snippets as and when they happen!,1217143,-1,8024
The design document is comprehensive and detailed. However there are several parts where the team is not yet sure of what exactly they want to. The document misses out on mention which model/controller they will be making changes to.,1216677,1,8024
Nice wiki page,1215275,-1,8024
The design doc is fulfilled and written pretty well.,1215195,-1,8024
The design doc is completed and gives exact information on what authors are gonna do.,1216971,-1,8024
The authors have not specified any code changes as of now so I can't comment on it. Suggestion: You might want to add any API Adapter class you plan to implement to generalize the solution for any future API implementations.  ,1216854,1,8033
The explanations are lucid.,1217155,-1,8033
More explanation on how to proceed with the implementation could have been added. Could have also added technologies to be used.,1216209,1,8033
"A simple enough explanation has been provided for how the functionality will be working.  Suggestion: I feel that the approach that the team will take to implement the functionality should have been explained more elaborately. For example what different possible methods will be implemented. Or how the web service will be used, or what kind of data the web service will provide for suggestion detection. ",1214948,1,8033
The design document seems to be incomplete. The team have done a good job explaining their problem statement and have included their implementation in brief. If the team could build up on this and explain their implementation in more detail while adding a few diagrams to explain the work they plan to do would be great. Also the team have not mentioned any test cases they plan to implement.,1216827,1,8089
"The project document does not fulfill the parameters of completeness. There are missing sections in the document i.e Testing plan, purpose.",1216106,1,8089
"Only the problem statement and proposed solution are present, it would be helpful to add the test plan asap.",1216056,1,8089
The design looks incomplete. There are no diagrams or screenshots. Could have added test plans as well.,1215445,1,8089
test plan missing.,1216570,1,8089
Please submit your design plan and add some visual aids.,1216162,1,8089
Testing Plan is stated and project design is not explained in depth.,1216946,1,8089
The design doc looks more or less complete given that it is just phase one of the project. I feel that some screenshots and a more detailed explanation would have been better.,1217138,1,8089
It would be better to include testing plan.,1216847,1,8089
"   There is no problem statement mentioned in the design document. It directly dives into the implementation details. This does not help the reader is understanding the need for a project. There is no test plan, project purpose. The team has tried to provide a design implementation details which is not very descriptive. More effort is needed to enable reader to understand the design better            ",1215969,1,8089
There are project purpose and design but no testing plan is included.,1215165,1,8089
The design is likely to increase the response time since API requests take time. It is essential to implement a system that keeps track of these API responses and disables this functionality when the API is unresponsive beyond and unreasonable time.,1214827,1,8033
The team has discussed the solution which is required for fixing the issue but has not proposed any design for their approach. So the team should detail their implementation and design for the reader to know what they plan to implement.,1216828,1,8089
" Design appears to be sound, however, it is unclear where the NLP algorithm is supposed to go. As in, will the 1st iteration use another service to analyze with the button, and then a 2nd iteration will add the local NLP algorithm?",1216790,1,8033
The design seems to be following DRY principle. ,1215628,-1,8033
"The design includes functionality, but does not explain how the data will flow.",1216107,1,8089
I don't think the authors plan to add methods to a wrong class. They seem to be working on the right class namely Review and its associated view page review.html.erb that exactly pertains to their project. The response time might potentially increase with this new feature. But fortunately the team has proposed to work on optimizing the suggestion algorithm so that it does not take forever to execute. The team has done a good job on the design documentation.,1215868,-1,8033
"The design appears to be sound, and wouldn't conflict with the existing classes or methods. ",1216433,-1,8033
The design covers the functionalities but there seem to be no concrete solutions for the same. Some more explanations was expected.,1215446,1,8089
"2 html files require change, i don't think it will affect anything.",1216730,-1,8033
Yes it completes functionality.,1216947,-1,8089
Yes the design seems to follow all of the functionalities required. It looks like they have gone through the Project description in a good manner.,1217139,-1,8089
The design incorporates all of the functionality required.,1216848,-1,8089
" No, the design approach is very high-level over-view. An MVC design pattern is an obvious conclusion for incorporating any functionality in a web application, but more precise details of the design approach from the team can help the reader in a long way in gaining understanding.",1215970,1,8089
The team has suggested reasonable changes to address the problem statement but have not included any details. The team should elaborate on the implementation they plan to do.,1216829,1,8089
The explanations are incomplete and do not provide sufficient reasoning.,1216108,1,8089
The authors could have listed out the issues followed by solutions with a diagram and some supporting screenshots. This makes the review easier.,1215447,1,8089
"I think the files that the authors plan to modify seems to be quite appropriate. As to the 'smell' of the code that can be ascertained only when they have started writing the code. So far though the design seems sound. There have however been no mention of the existence of any gems. I think the authors should explore that avenue as well as that would probably simplify their task. For example:- I found the gem sentimental that categorizes the phrases into positive, negative and neutral. I think this is something the authors can look into.",1216124,1,8033
"No design has been yet proposed by the author, however i feel the author is on track to make the right changes by looking at the files intended to be modified.",1215721,1,8033
"The team has done a good job in explaining the project and its purpose with the design and files that need to be changed. However,  Test plan is provided.",1216807,-1,8027
More effort should be expended on the design.The current explanation talks only about changes in the view. It would be better if the solution is explained at greater depth.,1216865,1,8033
The issue and the it's implementation has not been explained that well especially the project design and testting,1217009,1,8027
"More explanation regarding the solution would be helpful, explaining which files must be changed, etc.  ",1216058,1,8089
Test plan is blank... The diagrams are good but a little more writing on what you are planning to do would have been nice,1215842,1,8027
As the design document section is missing I cannot review the quality of their proposed design.,1216855,1,8033
Team needs to work upon adding more content in the document. Project design needs to be explained more with text and bullets. Team should add Test Plan.,1214966,1,8027
"Changes proposed by authors are good. But, they are explained in detail.",1216948,1,8089
Can elaborate more on the problem statement and the approach that you are planning to take,1215180,1,8027
The proposed changes sounds good to me. But as I mentioned screenshots help in a better understanding of the problem statement. Moreover a more detailed doc would have been better.,1217140,1,8089
"Here, the most important thing, the problem statement is missing. Secondly, no test plan has been mentioned. So, this makes the document incomplete.",1216495,1,8027
Testing plan is empty.,1215130,1,8027
Test plan missing. Links section empty(placeholder could have been provided or don't mention it at all). No design proposed.,1216672,1,8027
the project describes the project requirement in detail. the project statement is clear. the team has also included the design/flow which they will be following in order to achieve the desired results. the testing strategy is currently missing from the wiki. the team should inlclude the test plan in the documentation.,1215502,1,8027
"Detailed design and test plan lacks. For introduction part, the explanation is not clear enough and a little bit confusing. It is better to add more explantation about what the project is and point out the exact purpose clearly.",1215365,1,8027
Explained the project and its purpose with the design and files that need to be changed.  Test plan section is created but no description or plan is given.,1216762,1,8027
It gives purpose and design but no test plan.,1215155,1,8027
Not much has been talked about the methods to be added. but the files specified seems right,1217156,1,8033
Nice flow chart,1215300,-1,8088
There is a lot of visual help which is good but project design could have been expanded upon more,1217029,1,8088
The design has pretty much covered all the functionalities in the doc.,1216808,-1,8027
Design document does not seem complete. Problem statement is explained well. But project design or test plan is not mentioned.,1214981,1,8088
Hard to tell as very little explanation given.,1217010,1,8027
"Yes,  Design incorporates almost all the functionalities that should be tackled as per problem statement. ",1214967,-1,8027
"Yes, they are trying to incorporate all the requirements",1215181,-1,8027
Yes it incorporates all of the functionality required,1216158,-1,8027
"Well, a small paragraph on implementation has been given, but that does not quite serve the purpose. Though, there are UML diagrams which explain the flow.",1216496,1,8027
Yes.,1215131,-1,8027
No design provided. Use case diagrams have the functionality explained.,1216673,-1,8027
the team did a great work in understanding the requirements and have included the design for all the requirement mentioned in the requirement document.,1215503,-1,8027
"The deign gives some use cases for this project, but compared to all the functionality required for this project, it is not enough. More detailed description about the design of other things need to be added, such as model, view.",1215366,1,8027
The design has pretty much covered all the requested functionality. ,1216763,-1,8027
I do not think that the design will increase the response time of the system. Suggestion: I did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality. That would have been useful. The test plan does mention  ViewSuggestionMetricsForReviewSegment though. If this is the method name then it does not follow snake casing. ,1214949,1,8033
"The project purpose is stated, but not extremely clearly. It seems that in the ""Introduction"" part, there's just copy-pasted messages from the question statement. The flowchart in the introduction part is good, but where should this checkbox be implemented? It seems that here it should only be implemented in the instructor/administrator end, instead of students end. But that's not clearly stated in the project purpose part. The project design is also not very detailed. The title "" Do Some Changes"" doesn't seems to be very serious, but apart from that, the implementation details are also copy pasted from the online project requirements. the two picture of before and after illustration looks nice enough. It's good that the team has found some extra sources that would allow them to get this before and after picture.  The testing plan is not stated at all...",1214941,1,8088
The quality is of explanation is good and easy to follow. The team might want to add some low-level details for the code changes.,1216809,1,8027
"I think the testing plan is missing, others are good.",1216550,1,8088
The solutions and implementations have very little explanation. Even though the UML are helpful they should provide more text,1217011,1,8027
These explanations feel kinda minimalist,1215844,1,8027
The design document gives details about the problem statement and the expected outcome of the project. The project design for enforcing the deadlines is missing from the wiki.,1215900,1,8088
Design plan of the document only explains algorithm or flow for the code change. Team should explain the changes from existing system  to proposed solution with some texts.,1214968,1,8027
"Yes, they include project purpose, project design. It would be better if they include the testing plan.",1216707,1,8088
You can explain more on what actually are you planning to change.,1215182,1,8027
"The flowchart in the design doc explains their problem purpose clearly. Few improvements could be : The document didnt contain testing plan Project purpose i.e, introduction can be more detailed      ",1216490,1,8088
"As mentioned above, the document lacks a lot of details. The proposed changes have not been mentioned.",1216497,1,8027
"The project includes the problem statement. The team has described the problem statement in detail and has also provided visual aids. However, the team could have also included the way in which they implement these changes. ",1215487,1,8088
The chart is very clear.,1215132,-1,8027
Problem statement and the expected flow are clearly explained. I somehow feel that the name of this project and the requirements(problem statement) are not matching.   Other missing items: Test plans UML diagrams(except flow diagram). Low-level design details.,1216460,1,8088
No changes proposed.,1216674,-1,8027
"The document explains what the problem statement is. However, the purpose of the project could have been explained. The flowchart for the project is shown visually shown but the project design is not extensively explained. Test plan is not provided in the documentation.",1215731,1,8088
the team has explained the implementation design/strategy in detail. the design was explained with all the required details and was very easy to understand.  ,1215504,-1,8027
The mockups do explain where the team intends to add the 'Analyze' button. It however makes no explanation of where the analysis will be shown.,1214828,1,8033
The team only provides use cases. These cases gave me a brief insight of the flow but more literally explantation may need.,1215367,1,8027
UML diagrams are not included,1216035,1,8033
"The document mostly copies from the description provided by instructor and lacks the essential parts like design and test plan. Although some instructions provided, it is not clear enough and cannot help readers to figure out what the project is about and what's the purpose.",1215335,1,8088
Have explained the problem and its functionality is described but missing proposal for code changes. ,1216764,1,8027
UML diagrams are not provided. Please add it.,1215629,1,8033
"1. The grammar in introduction may need improvement to be more understandable. 2. For abbreviations, it would be better to give explanations to help others understand.",1215157,1,8027
The design document looks incomplete with only the introduction and project purpose sections that are mostly copy pasted from the problem statement provided. The proposed design seems to be limited to just an image. Also please consider changing the title 'Do Some Changes' to 'Problem Statement' or something more appropriate.,1216545,1,8088
"There is no detailed documentation provided by the author on changes. Just few DB data points and controller functionality (very generic). So, it hard to visualize a solution",1215971,1,8089
The documentation lacks the detailed design that they are planning to implement so it would be tough to answer the above question.,1216830,1,8089
Not everything,1215301,-1,8088
Yes it looks good,1217030,-1,8088
The design has explained the use cases with proper diagrams. Although more information is required to see any of the above-mentioned issues.,1216810,1,8027
The project design has not really been expanded upon so not able to tell,1217012,1,8027
Yes. Document incorporate all the functionalities mentioned in the problem statement assign. ,1214982,-1,8088
The reuse of the questionaire class is smart to reduce duplication. Otherwise the minimal explanations make it hard to judge,1215845,1,8027
"According to the project requirement https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Br9hm-SWIvl5ibWSfRVjmiYTQl5j27l8slWhv2iUCqQ/edit#heading=h.654oe3xw5p73  The design has nearly copy pasted all the textual explanation from here, but there's a lot of details that are remained unexplained - is the underlying functionality already implemented, and there's just an UI change that remains to be done? If yes, where is the underlying functionality? In which file? How is it implemented? If not,  then the corresponding implementation is missing in this design document.",1214942,1,8088
"1. Team technically understand the change and proposed solution does not lead to adding methods in wrong classes. 2. New design should not make the code smelly. 3. Changes are logical and proposed solution is reasonable enough. No gem required. 4. It should not increase response time. 5. No, the plan is nice and should be taken forward. ",1214969,-1,8027
"The design includes adding a checkbox field to the view, and based on whether the box is checked or not, students are allowed to or not to do reviews in the second round. This is the main functionality of the project. However, the authors do not mention how they are planning to implement this.",1215901,1,8088
"The team has included 2 screenshots of the review UI. The first one depicts the existing look and the 2nd one shows that they plan to include a new button that is responsible for analyzing the segmented text corresponding to each rubric where the student has reviewed and also display a pop-up message showing the results of suggestion metrics like volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics.  The team has also shown the user story in Connextra format and also described to scenarios- one happy path and one where no text is typed into the segmented text box input.  The team could have made the document even more visually palatable with flow chars / UML diagrams for Use case or Sequence diagram to support the feature and the scenarios they plan to implement.",1215869,1,8033
They include the interface required. They should include more details about how the functionality should be implemented.,1216708,1,8088
The design document contains all the functionality required.,1216491,-1,8088
"The team has used screenshots to explain their plan, but haven't used any diagrams, like UML, or flowchart to describe their flow.",1216434,1,8033
Try to give a class diagram inorder to explain your implementation,1215183,1,8027
"screenshots are added, which are enough to tell what they will be doing in the front end. a bit more can be explained on backend part by giving code snippets.",1216731,1,8033
"The team could explain the ""design""/solution in a more comprehensive way. The team has only pasted the description given in the google doc ",1215488,1,8088
"The flow has been explained through UML diagram. But, the proposed solution has not been given.",1216498,1,8027
The design does incorporate the functionalities required. It is descriptive and easy to understand.,1216461,-1,8088
No problem found.,1215133,-1,8027
The design incorporates all the functionality which are required. ,1215732,-1,8088
No design proposed.,1216675,-1,8027
The authors did not provide any design for the project.,1215336,1,8088
The changes are not yet suggested in the documentation. Only the files that will be changed are mentioned.,1215505,1,8027
"Since the document is mostly copy pasted from the problem statement, it covers what needs to be done. But it has not discussed about how it needs to be done. Adding the exact changes to be made makes it easier to understand the solution proposed.",1216546,1,8088
Not detailed design was provided. These information was not included.,1215368,1,8027
The authors have provided a mock-up of their final design which seems pretty good. However what's missing is UML diagrams. Something that would help understand the flow of functionality would be useful.,1216125,1,8033
The design has explained the use cases with proper diagrams but design to implement them is not absent.,1216765,1,8027
The screenshots posted give a clear picture of the intended output. It would be nice to have a design diagram.,1215722,-1,8033
Not clear,1215302,1,8088
"The design is specified to a certain extent, but does not provide where the changes will take place.",1216109,1,8089
It would be better to add more diagrams.,1216866,-1,8033
Not a lot of textual explanation given but the diagrams look adequate,1217031,1,8088
There are no such design explanations on which I can improve or suggest on. It would have been great if there were some more explanations.,1215448,1,8089
Changes proposed by authors are viable.,1216949,-1,8089
"The proposed design looks fine for now, but more details are required in order to make a better judgement. So I think that more effort should be expended.",1217141,1,8089
"Author does not explain the approach they are going to use. Team should add project purpose, project design to show case how they are going to tackle the issue.",1214983,1,8088
"The changes being proposed here are not comprehensive. It just talks about adding an option ""allow students to join review later"" but it doesn't say how. It also doesn't say whether it's a change in the administrator end or where. Also, as being stated in the above question, is the underlying functionality already implemented, and there's just an UI change that remains to be done? If yes, where is the underlying functionality? In which file? How is it implemented? If not,  then the corresponding implementation is missing in this design document.",1214943,1,8088
The authors have only mentioned about adding a checkbox field to the view. More changes will be required in order to enforce the deadlines on the students. Suggestion: Add a section called Design Plan to the wiki and mention a rough idea of how you are going to approach the project.,1215902,1,8088
"They include the interface required. They should include more details about their design, like how to implement and what need to be changed.",1216709,1,8088
I think more effort should be expended on the design. The addition of MVC suggested in the solution is vaguely explained. ,1216850,1,8089
The explanations were inadequate and could have been given more elaborately written. The document just contains the details given in the user story document by professor. More content can be added and the flow of logic can be added.  ,1216492,1,8088
"As stated above, it is difficult to understand the team's own solution to the given issue. The team could provide the paths to the files that they think should be changed. It would increase the readability of the documentation.",1215489,1,8088
It was easy to follow. ,1216462,-1,8088
The changes are explained by the authors. The quality of the explanation can be improved. Authors could have explained the changes a little more elaborately. The explanation is a little high level.,1215733,1,8088
The only changes stated in the document was copied from the description. It is not enough to explain what exact changes the team will provide and how they will be done. ,1215337,1,8088
The authors have provided a minimal explanation of the changes to be made. They have mentioned about the UI changes and not discussed further. It would be good to include the underlying changes. The team has identified a view file under the potentially modified files. They have not explored the controller and other files that need to be modified in order to support this. A design document needs to holistically portray your design and so it will be great if such details could be included.,1216547,1,8088
They have very well stated of about the purpose of their project. they have properly mentioned about the flow of their project which includes the flow chart for their project and also have specified of what kind of graphs they would prefer to show the visualization to the instructor. They have mentioned about how they will proceed in test case but haven't specified which files needs to be test inclusion of that would make the doc more complete,1215979,1,8080
"The authors have provided a mock up screen of the proposed solution. which clarifies how their solution will look like. However, the use of visual aids seems to be inadequate since, they have not added any class diagram, use-case or sequence diagram to elaborate their solution in depth. Suggestion: You might want to add a diagram for your proposed design pattern as suggested above to improvise your write-up",1216856,1,8033
"Wrtie up clearly explains the project purpose, what changes needs to be made, however including a mock test plan would have been better.",1215698,1,8080
"1)    Not indicated 2)     Not very clear from the documentation- no detailed explanation of design provided. 3)      Not enough details provided to conclude 4)     Not enough details provided to conclude  5)     Yes,the team needs to extend their effort on documenting the design better. Pl",1215972,1,8089
"Most of parts are included, but they should include more details in their doc.",1216999,1,8080
The team has done a good job trying to show with pictures what their changes will look like in the front- end. No UML has been provided.,1217157,1,8033
Can't comment on it right now,1215303,-1,8088
Adequate diagrams are given. Explanation of problem statement done well.,1216211,-1,8033
No visual aids are included. feel the team should include more visual aid to help the reader in understanding their problem and its implementation.,1216831,1,8089
Looks fine,1217032,-1,8088
"No visual aids are provided, rendering the explanations somewhat confusing.",1216110,1,8089
"Team can explain the algorithm they are going to follow or mention part of files they are going to make changes in. As changes do not seem heavy , it should not increase system response time. Team needs to put more efforts expended on the design and explain the efforts.",1214984,1,8088
There are no UML diagrams or screenshots. Please include the same in the following submissions to make the design document stronger.,1215449,1,8089
The team has a well composed design document. they have structured there design document into well written sub parts like design purpose and visualizations and files to be changed. They could have written there testing plan in a more elaborate manner by mentioning what kind of testing frame works will be used and what functionalities will be tested. The could have also added some use cases.,1216470,1,8080
"I believe a lot more effort should be expeneded on the design. As being addressed above, there are a lot of questions that are not addressed at all in this document. The formatting is not nice either. ",1214944,1,8088
"No design has been yet proposed by the author, however the goal of the project has been well described. Most of the write-up is the same as mentioned in the Google doc. Suggestion: Expand more on what changes need to be done in order to achieve the end result.",1215903,1,8088
"Design document has all the necessary information like project design, test plan. The team has gone through their topic deeply and can be seen by their illustration of their implementation. Also, they have included code snippets which show thoroughness of their approach ",1217024,-1,8080
They have included the initial design. It's suggested that they include more details about the design.,1216710,1,8088
"The design doc contains project purpose, project design and testing plan in the wiki. The wiki contains mock visualizations which make it easy to understand the project proposal and how are they planning to do. The design flow as a flow chart adds to the ease of understanding. The test plan explains about the technologies that they are planning to use for testing. Suggestion:  The test plan could say what should be done in testing than just the technologies to be used for a particular part of code. For ed, we plan to have a dummy small data and see if the graphs output the visualizations correctly, if the sum id being counted to 100% of the class participation etc... the stacked version could also have been represented for better understanding.",1215190,1,8080
The change is little and consists of only one html file. Shouldnt make the code smelly,1216493,1,8088
The team has not submitted code that should be added/implemented.  Suggestion: the team can add code snippets in the documentation along with the file names in which the changes should be done.,1215490,1,8088
Code level details are not covered in the doc. But the changes suggested follow the desired requirements. ,1216463,1,8088
"The document shows the flow of work really well.However, I would like to suggest to put more of test planning and the tools and technologies that will be used. This will enhance the quality of the document to a great extent.",1215325,1,8080
The authors have added the methods in the right class. The code is refactored properly. Appropriate gems have been used. The new system does not increase the response time and is efficient. More effort could have been put in the documentation by providing more UML diagrams and also by designing a test plan.,1215734,1,8088
"The design doc is good and provides a clear picture about the objective of the project. However,It would also be nice to know what features would be tested in the test plan.",1214768,1,8080
No detailed design was provided.,1215338,1,8088
All necessary sections are present.,1216687,-1,8080
The authors have talked about only the UI and not the underlying code. So it is difficult to assess the quality of the change. As far as the UI is concerned the authors have taken a right direction to place the checkbox. Providing further details about the proposed solution including the changes  needed in the controller code to support the UI change will help explain it.,1216548,1,8088
The design document contains the project purpose and the changes proposed by the team. The design flow gives an overview of the bar graphs that the team plan to generate for selected criterias. The introduction section however should largely focus on the project description. ,1214753,1,8080
No UML diagrams,1215304,1,8088
"The documentation covered almost everything from project purpose, design flow as well as some info on what files will be changed in the project.  Suggestion: I feel that the test plan was a bit vague. Some more details should have been provided. For example- What all features will be tested. Or maybe some info about edge cases and different scenarios that will be covered. ",1214881,1,8080
Yes visual aid has been provided in the form of Flow charts and screen shots. UML could added.,1217033,1,8088
A use case diagram is provided in the documentation. The team should add a class diagram as well to give an idea of the low-level implementation.  ,1216811,1,8027
Yes the UML diagram have been correctly implemented and help in understanding their approach,1217013,-1,8027
"Team has added a diagram that explains the problem statement and its effects, very well. Team could add UML diagrams to explain the application, changes, sequence of actions, state , actors involved.",1214985,1,8088
"The write-up is well written but is missing a few things - the original problem description, how will the changes being proposed will be implemented etc.",1215220,1,8080
The diagrams are very very large on the webpage. Consider making them half the size.,1215846,1,8027
There's a flow chart about how the end result look like. But the flow chart only tells a user story. There's no detailed implementation plan in this flow chart. 3):  some diagrams are too high-level design and do not provide enough details. applies here.,1214945,1,8088
"Team has majorly include diagrams for the code change and algorithm flows. Team should add UML diagrams to explain flow of the application change, sequence of actions, actors involved. ",1214970,1,8027
"Yes, gives clear understanding using the use case diagram",1215184,-1,8027
"The authors have included a flowchart which concisely explains the functionality that the authors are going to add. They have also included 2 screenshots of the UI, showing the end result in the 'after' image. UML diagrams are not included. Please add, will give an understanding of how the implementation will be done.",1215904,1,8088
The diagrams is detailed and easy to understand. But it is a bit too long. The team can simplify it.,1216711,1,8088
"UML diagrams are drawn well to explain the flow. So, the diagrams help in explaining the project flow.",1216499,-1,8027
"Screenshots which were included was explanatory. More figures such as logic flow, wireframes etc can be added for better understanding.",1216494,-1,8088
Visual aids are great.,1215134,-1,8027
Yes the design incorporates all of the functionalities,1215980,-1,8080
Use case diagrams explain the requirements properly but no system design related diagram or mock ups are given.,1216676,1,8027
Incorporates intended functionality.,1215699,-1,8080
"No diagrams are present, would help reviewers better understand what is going on.",1216060,1,8089
The team has submitted diagrams and screenshots that explain what is expected from the solutions.  ,1215491,-1,8088
"Yes, their design has all of the functionality that are required.",1217000,-1,8080
Wireframes have been given stating what the end product will look like. But I did not find any UML diagrams or tables.  Suggestion: The team could have mentioned use case diagrams or a flow chart explaining the flow of the functionality.,1214950,1,8033
"The document contains a flow diagram that analyzes the system's requirements and expected flow. However, it can certainly make use of other UML diagrams in the expected flow section to give more clarity about the requirements and the sequence of actions. ",1216464,-1,8088
The team did a great work in explaining the requirement with the help of flow chart which helped in better understanding of the requirements and proposed design.,1215506,-1,8027
"A flow chart is depicted in the documentation. However, other UML diagrams could have been represented to show the structure and the sequence of the project. The flow chart depicted is a little high level. The total capacity of the project could have been represented by more UML diagrams.",1215735,1,8088
The diagrams are clear enough to help me understand the flow of the project. ,1215369,-1,8027
"The team provided a diagram what feature needs to be added, but it is not adequate.",1215339,1,8088
"Diagrams for use cases are given properly, but the class diagram is missing.",1216766,1,8027
The flow diagram used is basically a pictorial representation of the problem statement and so it does not really add any more value. It would be really helpful if the authors could include a real flow diagram that shows the actual flow of events. The screenshots provided help us to understand what changes the authors are expecting in the UI.,1216549,1,8088
The flow charts are good and help a lot in understanding the work. Again. it would be better to explain the abbreviations.,1215159,1,8027
The design document has included all the functionality that is required by the project description.,1216471,0,8080
Yes,1217025,-1,8080
"The design incorporates and clearly explains flow of diagram for class performance, but not much is included for Integration of review performance. suggestion : The topic of Integration of review performance can be talked about in brief .",1215191,1,8080
"The writeup shows very little since the work has not yet been started. Therefore it does not clearly incorporates what all functionalities will be required. However, there are some mentioned in proposed changes area.",1215326,1,8080
The design has a good design flow diagram which is clear and concise.,1214769,-1,8080
Yes the design incorporated all functionality required. But more explanation is needed around which graph they intend to show.,1216688,1,8080
The design follows the basic functionality expected by proposing a bar graph solution for the select criteria. It could incorporate the rubrics that the team are planning to target. The flow in general does help to understand the project.,1214754,1,8080
The design document incorporated all the functionalities that the project is supposed to be implementing.  No suggestions. ,1214882,-1,8080
Yes,1215221,-1,8080
"Unfortunately there were no visual aids provided, even though they went through the plan in a good way but few diagrams would definitely help.",1217142,1,8089
It would be better to add some UML diagrams.,1216851,-1,8089
No UML diagran,1215973,1,8089
There are no visual aids given. Maybe some flow charts or screenshots can be added to help people understand the project.,1215169,1,8089
"The explanation is quite well documented such as including the flow chart , kind of bar graphs they would prefer and the files that they will update. Adding of screenshots of the flow of the website would make it more easy to understand for a leyman.",1215981,1,8080
Changes suggested look good.,1215700,-1,8080
"The overall quality of the explanations are good, but they should include more details about their design, which may not be easy to understand.",1217001,1,8080
the team has mentioned all the files that will be changed and have also written a paragraph stating what are the proposed changes. The team could also document the changes that are being made to individual code files stating the changes done using code snippets and the reason why the changes are being made. Also they can talk about what design patterns principle are being used to incorporate the functionality that is being proposed. The team could also use CRC cards to depict the proposed code changes. This will not only help readers understand the report better but also help the team in dividing work between the team members and fast tracking the completion of project.,1216472,1,8080
"The team has well explained what are they going to change. Though I didn't get how are they going to do the proposed changes. Since they are going to introduce a new feature, they have focussed more on explaining how to use the new feature. ",1217026,1,8080
"The changes proposed for the Class performance is adequate and explains the files to be changed, what changes from the controller perspective and views perspective. no particular suggestions proposed",1215192,-1,8080
Right the project is in its initial phase. The overall changes proposed by the authors are now very unclear about how they are going to work.,1215327,1,8080
The team proposed to add a bar graph to give a pictorial view of the scores and indicate the performance of students.,1214770,-1,8080
"More explanation around only those two graphs are being considered is needed. While its early in the project, at least what changes will be made to a file could have been mentioned.",1216689,1,8080
proposed changes needs more explanation at the files and system specifically what files needs to be changed and how ,1216179,1,8080
"The changes proposed by the team include implementing a bar chart, stacked or single. Based upon the project description, it is advised that the team look for other alternatives like pie chart that would help to span the results with a minimal look.       ",1214755,-1,8080
A simple enough explanation has been provided for the functionality.  No suggestions.,1214883,-1,8080
Could not find any explanations regarding the changes proposed.,1215222,1,8080
For Now the design proposed looks perfect.,1215982,-1,8080
Design flow looks good.,1215701,-1,8080
"Their designs are great, but some designs may be complicated.",1217002,1,8080
The authors seem to have studied the code well and have thought of a good plan to implement the project. They also seem to follow DRY principles while adding and changing code. Also the new design flow is quite simple and easy to understand which can be implemented without any high degree of convoluted code.,1216473,-1,8080
"The proposed solution sounds good. They haven't really mentioned the changes in turn of programmer language. I couldn't visualize how are they going to make changes. They have mentioned few html.erb file but I think they would need put a good amount of work to implement the new feature. I think the team could have been more precise in their approach, for example, they could have included what all new methods they need to add or modify the existing one.",1217027,1,8080
"The design changes as described are sound, they are mostly on Javascript for the visualization and dont potentially make the code ""smelly""",1215193,-1,8080
"So far whatever is discussed seems to go in the right direction.However, not much research is done so far. I would suggest them to quickly start researching about how they are going to work and how will the technologies they plan to use work.",1215328,1,8080
The author is clear with the intended output for the project but what actual changes are to be made is not yet clear as work on the project might not have started yet.,1214771,1,8080
"Since the graphs will be constructed dynamically for the entire class as whole, the impact on response time needs to be considered in case there are a large number of entries to process as this could involve database calls.",1216690,1,8080
The team has given a design flow that underlines the basic way in which they are planning to target the issue at hand. It can make use by giving an example as to how the output might look and the document must also describe the tools that would be used for achieving the task.,1214756,1,8080
The design looks good enough. It mostly deals with html.erb files to accommodate the graph and some database filtering in the controllers.I do not think that the design will increase the responses time of the system. Suggestion: If the details regarding how the graph will be implemented or any gem will be used should have been given. I did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality. That too would have been useful. ,1214884,1,8080
"No plan provided, cannot comment.",1215223,1,8080
"The UML diagram included here is a flow chart diagram , which explains the process of how the instructor will be able to see the visualization and is easy to understand the flow",1215983,-1,8080
Design flow diagram is included indicating the flow which is good.,1215702,-1,8080
"The UML diagrams is great, which is clear and easy to understand.",1217003,-1,8080
The have included a detailed design flow representation and have also included the visualizations. The could have added Lo-Fi UI cards to depict changes to views which will help them visualize the changes and also help instructors in suggesting improvements at an early stage which will help reduce unnecessary code changes in latter stages of the project.,1216474,1,8080
One flow chart and one chart graph are included. I find the chart incomplete and confusing too. I wasn't able to relate how this is going to help real scenario. The better way would be to use a use case diagram or take example of our current class programs.,1217028,1,8080
The team has attached a bar chart for visualization which helps in understanding their purpose. Suggestion : More visual aids could have been added. The stacked bar chart as mentioned earlier . More mockups could have been added.,1215194,1,8080
"There are no UML diagrams as such in the writeup.However, there is a flowchart which somewhat gives a clear view how they plan to do the things.",1215329,1,8080
The design diagram is good and it would also be helpful to have a few screenshots of the current expertiza view.,1214772,1,8080
Diagram for stacked chart missing from the design document.,1216691,1,8080
NO UML diagram,1216181,1,8080
The team has provided a flow diagram that helps to infer the structural outline of the project. The scope of the project can be perceived from the diagram.,1214757,-1,8080
A flowchart and graph has been shown in the documentation.  Suggestions: I feel that there should have been mockups of the screens where the functionality will actually appear. Team should have shown how the solution would look like on the expertiza page. There could have been use case diagrams too. ,1214885,1,8080
Two graphs provided provide a good understanding of the process and what expected visualization should be. More diagrams would have been helpful.,1215224,-1,8080
There are no visual aids to support the document.I would suggest them to design a flow chart that can show their design planning.,1215697,1,8028
No diagrams provided.,1216424,1,8028
No diagrams included in the document. Adding some diagrams to explain what the system is and how the design will look like will be better.,1215394,1,8028
"There is a webpage linked which is helpful, but I do not see any other visual aids. It would be better to have some screenshots to help the reader understand your project.",1214980,1,8028
Testing plan not included.  ,1215964,1,8040
The sections included for this design document cover the intent of the group to find and solve the bugs required for their project. I am not sure that the Introduction section reads as an introduction but more as a project problem statement. If this is an introduction more should be included as to what is the purpose of the project and what this current introduction content means. ,1214814,1,8040
The wiki page is prepared with a good research on the topic. Just test plans are left to be added.,1215210,1,8040
Test Plan is not present.,1216989,1,8040
Include testing plan if possible,1215440,1,8040
"The team did a good job in explaining the problem statements for each issue and providing their proposed solutions. The purpose of the project is clear from the document as is a composite of several independent issues. The problem is that testing plan is missing from the project. I would suggest starting from the most basic test cases that check the functionality (e.g. one spec per issue) and then elaborating from there. Moreover, while fixing some issues like #1008 and #1065 consists of a small modification to the existing code, there are other cases where the design decisions are not provided and it would be better for the team to include some justifications and possible discussions of design patterns. The document extensively uses diagrams that depict application flows for each use case which is impressive.",1215056,1,8040
The team has presented a detailed explanation of  all the topics in the documentation,1215305,-1,8040
Following can be added.  Project Introduction & Motivation Description of Project,1216585,-1,8040
Everything looks great as they have added the uml diagrams ad explained everything in detail. Test plan is missing which can be added as they are solving a lot of issues in this project.,1216667,1,8040
The document is very well-written. Just the test plan is missing.,1216355,1,8040
The document includes the problem statements and proposed solutions of all the issues. All the proposed solutions have test plans as well.,1216515,-1,8040
Project purpose and project design are present and really detailed! Test plan was absent though...,1215492,1,8040
"The design document is extremely well written. The project purpose is mentioned, although it looks similar to what is already mentioned in the Google design document. I would suggest the team to add their own understanding of the project, how this project is helpful to the system ? Why are these changes/project necessary ? Additionally I would also suggest the team to add a test plan section to their documentation. Any bugs fixed need to be tested thoroughly for edge cases as well as core fucntionality. ",1216340,1,8040
"The project design is well presented and solves all issues. However, testing plan and project purpose are missing. You could have given at-least a basic high level overview of testing in the end, Overall good effort!",1216126,1,8040
The design does corporate all the functionalities required.,1215965,-1,8040
"Yes, the doc covers every functionality and detailed description of the approach to deal with the issue. ",1215211,-1,8040
The design proposes solutions for all the issues. Every issue is well described and flow diagrams are provided for the solutions,1216127,-1,8040
"They have each listed bug explained, at the very least, and most have a resolution pathway. A+.",1215493,-1,8040
"The document incorporates all of the functionalities as mentioned in the google design document. The team have made sure to list, explain, and provide proposed solutions for each bug to be fixed. Good Job guys !!!",1216341,-1,8040
"Yes, I think it includes everything, all the functionalities required. ",1216516,-1,8040
The design incorporates all the functionality required. Suggestion: Including screenshots or screen-mockups would make the document easier to understand.,1216356,-1,8040
Yes they have incorporated everything. They have explained the solutions as well.,1216668,-1,8040
It lists out all the functionalities in the problem solution and looks very clear and very elaborate with codes and diagrams.,1216586,-1,8040
The team has included all the 5 issues as stated in the project description google doc. The team has provided solutions for all these issues as well. The solutions are descriptive and easy to follow,1215306,-1,8040
The issues are addressed thoroughly. But probablty the issue on staggered deadline needs to be handled carefully the solution might cause other code effects need to cover all the individuals involved,1215441,1,8040
The design document separately describes every distinct issue and in some cases even provides possible finalized fixes to the source code.,1215057,-1,8040
"The changes proposed by the authors are reasonable, they do not introduce any clutter or inconsistencies to the code. However, issues #1017 and #1072 do not have a clear solution. In one case changes to the assignment controller are proposed but it cannot be inferred how adequate those changes will be.",1215058,1,8040
The authors have listed all the proposed changes in the problem solution. I was able to understand it without any trouble.  Overall quality of the proposals is good.,1216587,-1,8040
"Its good, can be more elaborative. Also in sections where you have added the code changes, you ca add comments to the code as well for better understanding.",1216669,1,8040
The document is very impressive and provides detailed description of all the proposed changes. Explanations and steps given are easy to follow. No suggestions.,1216357,-1,8040
"Well, after reading all the proposed solutions, I think they look good and the explanation behind all of them are satisfactory as well.",1216517,-1,8040
"For the bugs which have explanations, the proposed fixes and explanations of the problem are sound. I'd like more info on bugs #1017 and #1072, as they only have the flow.",1215494,-1,8040
"The good thing about this wiki is that the proposed solution sections is brilliantly explained. The team have clearly mentioned all filenames where they propose to make changes, drawn diagrams to illustrate the flow control, and added snippets of code where necessary. Brilliant",1216342,-1,8040
The explanations are well written and describe the workflow well. There could have been a little more detail in the explanation as some of the statements are very high level.,1216128,-1,8040
"The changes mentioned seems to be well thought and written as they are well explanatory. With adequate description, the doc covers all the issues.",1215212,-1,8040
"A fix for the second and fourth issues is missing at the current moment. If this is included as in the other issues then the document will adequately propose solutions. Also, perhaps more elaboration on the 3rd fix on how the columns are not being copied over (I know the code is pasted but a simple worded explanation would be nice too).",1214816,1,8040
Overall work is done good. But Explanations are bit lengthy and somewhat hard to follow. Ther is no need to mention the existing code.Which simplymmakes the documentation lengthier.,1215966,1,8040
The design looks a bit complicated and will increase the response time of the system. It can make the code smelly. Too complicated code handled in issue 1 which could be refactored.,1215967,1,8040
The designs proposed makes some sense as they are backed up with diagrams to make them very clear of their approach.,1215213,-1,8040
"The design is well though of however instead of writing the time difference logic, gems could have been used which are well tested and bug free.",1216129,1,8040
"Honestly in my opinion, the team has given a lot of thought into how to fix the bugs. The design/proposed solutions look completely logical and should fix the bugs with no/least redundancy. It also looks like the team has already managed to fix a few bugs as well. Kudos to them.",1216343,-1,8040
"I would appreciate a little more detail on bugs #1017 and #1072, which have a flow established, but no code snippets.",1215495,1,8040
The proposed solution would be the best approach to tackle the issues in my opinion. They would not make the code smelly or complicated.,1216518,-1,8040
For now design plan looks good enough.,1216358,-1,8040
"I don't think the authors plan to add methods to the wrong class. They are modifying the right files. The new design does not appear to potentially make the code ""smelly"". But for few issues you haven't added any files which you'll be modifying, only the uml is given, you can add them before the final submission.",1216670,1,8040
It appears to be sound.    ,1216588,-1,8040
"The team has provided solutions for all the issue but one. For issue#1017, the team has only provided a flow chart(description of the issue graphically) but the code which needs to be changed/added should be looked upon.    Suggestion: The team can mention the way in which they attempt to tackle the issue by mentioning the files and the logic behind the proposed solution.",1215308,1,8040
"The designs that the authors have proposed are consistent with the code and do not introduce any obvious problems. However, the design decisions for issues #1017 and #1072 are missing and therefore cannot be assessed. I would suggest including the discussion of the specific parts of the source code that are going to be addressed in this project. Posting the exact solution is not necessary.",1215059,1,8040
The diagrams that are provided in the document visualize the workflows of different actors that pertain to the given issues. They are definitely helpful for the reader to understand the scope of the problem that is being addressed.,1215060,-1,8040
The team has provided flowcharts which makes it easier to understand their solution. The provided diagrams seem enough for the reader to understand the solution.,1215309,-1,8040
Visual aids are used properly and very helpful in understanding. UML diagrams follow the convention. Everything looks proper.,1216589,-1,8040
"Uml looks good, explains whats happening.",1216671,-1,8040
Flowchart is included in the document but there is no screenshot or mock-up screens. ,1216359,1,8040
They have included flowcharts for each proposed solution. The flowcharts can clearly explain the work flow.,1216519,-1,8040
"All the diagrams are great, and none feel extraneous.",1215496,-1,8040
The diagrams provided clearly explain the flow control of the proposed solutions. The team even mentions preconditions needed for the flow control. the only suggestion I have is that the team could also add a low-fi sketch or screenshot of how the view would like after before/after Issue #1008 is fixed.,1216344,-1,8040
Flow diagrams are well thought of and explain the workflow well. Adequate details are given for each diagram.,1216130,-1,8040
"Diagrams are proper, precise and detailed to understand the behaviour of the system (currently and after making changes). Good effort in making the diagram and wiki.",1215214,-1,8040
"issue 1065 uml diagram is too high level so it does not provide enough details, Rest all diagrams follow the standards and are easy to understand.",1215968,1,8040
So far the idea is clearly articulated. Few things which are not defined are explicitly stated in the doc.,1214891,1,8019
What is wrong with the current implementation is clearly not stated.,1214893,1,8019
The design looks fine but no explanation as to why this is done? Is it already existing or is this a new feature?,1214894,-1,8019
The UML is good. Liked the way they have clearly mentioned the functions.,1214895,-1,8019
The step by step instructions are detailed and is good.,1214913,-1,8019
Yes the design looks complete,1214911,-1,8019
Implementation details haven't been added yet but that's fine as it hasn't been started yet.,1214914,-1,8019
A very nice UML diagram is added explaining the cases.,1214915,-1,8019
"Document is explained well with clear understanding of the issue. Problem statement, design plan is explained well. Team can work on adding test plans. As well as well diagrams and screenshots to make the document more explanatory.",1215001,1,8019
Yes. The design document incorporates all the functionalities stated in problem statement. ,1215002,-1,8019
"Document is explained well. Also the flow of document is good. Team can add screenshots of existing documents, also some diagram to explain the solution well.",1215003,-1,8019
"1. Authors solution do not seem to create methods to wrong classes. 2. New design code does not make the code ""smelly"". 3. No new gem required. Explained solution is adequate. 4. Proposed design should not hamper system performance. 5. Well efforts expended on the design  ",1215004,-1,8019
"No UML diagrams included in the document. Please include application flow diagram, state diagram or sequence diagram or Use Case diagrams to make the document for readable.  ",1215005,1,8019
The problem statement is not clear,1215290,1,8019
It's not a great explanation,1215292,0,8019
The implementation plan is not there,1215293,1,8019
No UML diagrams,1215294,1,8019
"The team has explained the problem statement well  and has done job in explaining the flow for every user with diagrams for them. However, the team needs to add the design approach and the testing plan for the project.",1215635,1,8019
The design has not been stated explicitly so its difficult to comment only with the flow and UML diagrams whether it is appropriate and the best way to address the issue.,1215636,1,8019
Team has not proposed any solution for fixing the issue. They should add their approach in the documentation.,1215637,0,8019
The team has done a commendable job in creating a very detailed UML diagram and explaining the case of every user very well.,1215639,-1,8019
The team has not addressed the project design approach and the proposed implementation details in the documentation.,1215638,1,8019
"Test plan is to be added, but the purpose and the design are coherent and easy to follow.",1215610,-1,8019
"Includes everything, as far as I can tell.",1215611,-1,8019
The proposed flows and project tasks are sufficiently detailed that I can understand the relationship between the issue and how they're going to solve it in each step.,1215612,-1,8019
"I don't have any issues with the design, looking forward to seeing some code snippets to understand it better.",1215613,-1,8019
"Only a single UML diagram is present, but I'd have appreciated a couple of flow charts to accompany the expected flows.",1215614,1,8019
"The high-level design which is needed to start with the work looks prominent. As the project proceeds, few intricacies resulting due to design conflicts, scalability need to be addressed as and when required. But the team has laid out a solid foundation to begin with.",1215688,-1,8019
Authors have a clear idea of what details need to be included to make the audience understand the purpose of the project. The design document is sufficient to get the basic idea and implementation.,1215689,0,8019
The authors have explained the workflow very well with respect to the different types of users involved in the particular feature. The language is simple to follow.,1215690,-1,8019
Use case diagram adds extra weight to the design since the visuals always help the reader to relate the project well.,1215692,-1,8019
"The problem statements and design have been explained. But the team could have explained how they have planned to carry out the changes. Though this could be a vague idea, it could have been added. Likewise with the test plan too.",1216222,1,8019
"The design document describes the problem statement, the approach towards the goal and the flow expected for the given issue. Certain improvements can be made to the introduction by providing a brief overview of the project details instead of introducing the Expertiza environment. The team plans on updating the test plan after implementation.",1216286,1,8019
The design does incorporate the functionality required of making reviews public allowing the students to toggle the visibility of review submitted. It is descriptive and easy to understand.,1216287,-1,8019
The proposals given by the team are reasonable and adequately cover the features to be established during the course of the project. The changes suggested follow the desired requirements. ,1216288,-1,8019
The design proposed by the team looks complex in terms of the functionalities desired. They must backup these changes by providing a pictorial representation of the task like the one described in the documentation. This can help to understand the project in a better way.,1216289,1,8019
"The document contains a UML Use Case Diagram that analyze the system's requirements and describes the actors involved and the relationship between them. It helps to understand the overview of the project details. However, it can certainly make use of a flow diagram in the Expected Flow section that gives more clarity about the sequence of actions. The flow diagram can follow from the use case diagram to show the tasks performed by the actors in a serial order.  ",1216290,1,8019
"The test plan is not yet done. Rest, I could see that the document is very much complete.",1216475,1,8019
The design includes almost all functionalities. Very well shown in the implementation diagrams.,1216476,0,8019
"Though an approach has been mentioned of the proposed changes, but they do not have a test plan.",1216477,1,8019
"As mentioned in their Approach section, the team decided on adding some functionalities like checkboxes and views. I find these changes perfect for the problem statement given.",1216478,-1,8019
They have used a USE case diagram to explain flow. I found it quite understandable and all the steps are clearly drawn out in the diagram. It clearly explains the steps required to approach a situation.,1216479,-1,8019
"Except for the test plan, the design doc seems to have all the important details. The team should add a test plan before starting in order to go for a test-driven development. ",1216747,1,8019
"I think the design perfectly captures the view part. However, it looks a bit high level. I think more low level and model related details can be added. For e.g. what design pattern would be used, the tables that will be affected. ",1216748,1,8019
The explanations are very clear and easy to follow. They give the idea of how team intends to approach the feature.,1216749,-1,8019
"I think overall it looks good. However, a bit more low-level details may give better insight about such issues.",1216750,-1,8019
I think the UML diagram can be improved further by adding the classes that are related to the use cases separately.  ,1216751,1,8019
Test Plan is not present.,1216981,1,8019
"Yes, it does",1216982,-1,8019
Created a great visual aid which helps us explain the plan.,1216985,-1,8019
"Document is very well written and contains all the details like problem statement, solution, files to be modified, testing plan.",1215630,-1,8021
The write-up is very minimal. I think it should elaborate made ,1217074,-1,8021
"The project purpose is stated in detail, in the Introduction part. Starting from the background and problem statement ( to improve the quality of report views""). The purpose is stated in five different small goals separately: make changes in view submissions, view scores, view review report, author feedback report and teammate review report five different parts. In terms of project purpose, it's comprehensive and detailed. As for project design, it is carefully outlined in the ""Solution"" and ""Modification of files"" part. I think the project design might needs a bit more description, in terms of what steps needs to do first, and what steps needs to be done next. It seems that all the changes are for the UI, but is there any UI that can be served as a pattern, for the usage of others? Or is there any implementation of one UI dependent on the implementation of another? Here, I think there needs to be more detailed steps. The testing plan includes detailed steps in terms of how to test the implementation as a  end user. I like it very much because it is both succinct and very intuitive. It will be good to add some sample pictures when the project is over and some pictures that display the functionality becomes available.",1214931,1,8021
"It says what they will do, but it seems high level. Would appreciate some diagrams or mockups",1214839,-1,8021
"The team has done a good job in listing down the project requirements and design. However I suggest the testing plan be improved. In place of giving steps on how a reviewer should test the project, the team should instead list how they wish to write tests for the functionality added, for example-: list down a dummy set of data in any one report view, mention how they would like to write a test for this. Say using capybara, and then how to corroborate the result from the view.",1216375,1,8021
The doc seems complete. All aspects of the problem statement are covered and test plan is also included. A use-case diagram will be useful to add.,1216450,1,8021
Design doc contains everything in clear explanation,1216116,-1,8021
The authors can add the project's purpose (why this feature is important/helpful). The authors have mentioned the plan to use tablesorter jQuery to sort the table but No design plan is included. I suggest the team to remove the introduction to expertiza since it was clearly mentioned in the requirements to not include it.,1215255,1,8021
"The design doc for now, specifies only the issues. No approach has been given yet on prospective solutions  ",1216631,1,8021
"The design document has clearly mentioned the problem statement and the subtasks that need to be performed. However, it looks a bit incomplete to me. Suggestions: Try adding what were your proposed approaches and a clear reasoning as to why did you choose a particular approach. You can simply remove the statement on Expertiza, as the professor has clearly advised us to avoid doing it.  ",1214926,1,8021
"The design document is comprehensive and covers most of the relevant topics. General problem statement is defined clearly and then divided into multiple specific subtasks which will be addressed by the project. The solution to the problem specifies the library that will be utilized in the implementation and classifies several types of sorting that needs to be done. This is followed by the files that will be modified in the scope of this project. The primary problem is that the document does not provide any extensive discussion about the possible design decisions and implementation strategies. It is stated that scripts have been added at the top of the file to sort the contents of table. I would suggest elaborating on the specifics, what functions are called and how will the javascript function be tied to the html table contents.",1215225,1,8021
"The team provided sufficient information on the project purpose and design. The test plan is adequate.        It would be better, to provide a solid reasoning for incorporating different sorting. Few sorting implementations, ie) by name and team are intuitive. But the need to sort the Author feedback report and teammate review report, in the way suggested by the team, the reasoning is not very apparent. Need more problem statement elaboration.  ",1216021,1,8021
"The document mentions the tools of JQuery sorting table, in fact which API or any sample code that can be referenced to is expected in the document. Also, this project seems to focus on the view part of Expertiza, so the test plan should be more detailed, cover more edge case. ",1216732,1,8021
It incorporates all the functionalites.,1215631,-1,8021
"Though the pull request has been passed, but the writeup does not explain the details of the implementation, like what sorting algorithm the team has implemented using jQuery etc. The design part of the writeup is very hollow, and needs further refinement.",1217075,-1,8021
"Yes, all the functionalities, including viewing submission, viewing scores, viewing review report, author feedback report, teammate review report are all available. I believe a more intuitive, detailed explanation or description might be even more useful, while describing the functionalities in the design. Here, such design is still just simply stated as the project goal.",1214932,1,8021
The wiki is detailed enough that it mentions all the functinoalities required in the project. The team has made sure to not miss out on any functionality and they even took out time to list the column names in each report they would add the sort feature to. Good work guys.,1216376,-1,8021
I think the authors have incorporated most of the functionality in the design document.,1216451,-1,8021
Design document contains all the functionality required.,1216117,-1,8021
Please add more details about the solution. How to code for that functionality is yet to be thought of.,1216632,-1,8021
"Yes, as per the solution provided, it does seem that the design incorporates the required functionality. It considers sorting on all the specified fields. Suggestions: Since you have mentioned the use of jQuery tablesorte, you may also add explanation as to what is tablesorter and try explaining atleast for one field (e.g. name) as to how does it work to sort the entries.    ",1214927,-1,8021
"The design document lists every issue that is being addressed in the project, providing comprehensive details on the functionality that is required for each one.",1215226,-1,8021
" Yes, their design seems to cover all the intended functionality requested for the project. But how the team will achieve the few not so straight-forward sorting such as the one indicated in Author feedback report is not clear to conclude, their approach will achieve the intended functionality    ",1216022,1,8021
Changes look good.,1215632,-1,8021
"The explaiantions provided by the author are at a very high level view, and needs further drilling down into the implementation.",1217076,1,8021
"The changes being proposed including the modification of 6 files: submission, team title, view, review-report, feedback report, and teammate review report. I think the lists of modifications are comprehensive. But more details needs to be stated: How should we change this list_submissions.html.erb file? Should we only change some lines or should we change the entire pattern? In which file will the sorting be implemented? there does have information on how to sort by JQuery, but there's not yet information, in terms of which file, which part needs to be changed.  ",1214933,1,8021
could use more detail,1214841,-1,8021
"The proposed changes section of the wikipedia clearly mentions the column names the team would implement sort on. But, how they want to implement the sort could be explained a little more in detail. They mention they would use tablesorter JQuery, but I would suggest to add some sort of a pseudocode that would explain better how exactly does the sorting work.",1216377,1,8021
It is easy to follow the changes that the authors have proposed.,1216452,-1,8021
Adequate explanation was given,1216118,-1,8021
The explanations can be more detailed. Overall understandable.,1215257,1,8021
Solutions have been proposed. How they are going to do that is not mentioned.,1216633,-1,8021
Team have shared the link for the TableSorter which explains the functionality,1215839,-1,8021
The authors have taken efforts to identify the right places for making the identified changes. It seems that they have already done some changes. Suggestions: I feel that the proposed changes on a high level. You might want to go a level deeper to explain what will your changes be like. You might also consider adding use case for your changes. ,1214928,1,8021
The authors provide a list of files that will be modified in the scope of this project and a high level overview of what needs to be done. The rationale behind using a tablesorter jQuery library and defining the code in the script seems reasonable but the team needs to discuss more details to further clarity the solution. ,1215227,-1,8021
"It states the internal jQuery library they plan to use to achieve the sorting, again more details on implementations are required to be documented to assess the quality of the solution.",1216023,1,8021
need some diagram or prototype. ,1216734,-1,8021
Mainly needs html files to be changed and they have mentioned them which looks good ,1215633,-1,8021
"As mentioned above, the design part is pretty weak for a writeup, and needs to be further worked upon.",1217077,-1,8021
"I believe more effort should be expended on the design. Currently, it is still not so comprehensive. A lot of details can be added in terms of how each file should be modified and how the sorting will be implemented.",1214934,1,8021
"The design proposed by the authors appears to be sound. Since this project is only to sort the views, there will be no code added to either the models or controllers. I hope the team only adds one sorting function per view and allows that one function to handle sorting for different columns in that view.",1216378,-1,8021
"I don't think the authors plan to add methods to the wrong class. They are modifying the right files. The new design does not appear to potentially make the code ""smelly"". The team is using one of the existing gems in their design.",1216453,-1,8021
"The solution looks like it doesnt add any overhead and the doesnt make the code ""smelly""",1216119,-1,8021
The solution seems right.,1215258,-1,8021
The team has not mentioned about how they are planning to do the changes.,1216634,-1,8021
"I think that the authors have identified changes in the html.erb files, which looks right to me. As it only deals with the sorted view of instructor reports, the changes must go in the views part of the application.  Suggestion: You can try to add a bit of information on whether your changes include addition of new code, deletion of existing code, or just slightly modifying or extending the existing code and justify it. Query: Do you plan on creating  a drop-down like option to choose from which type of sorting is to be performed? If yes, it is an add-on user-friendly feature.",1214929,1,8021
"The authors talk about adding the tablesorter class to the html table and using javascript scripts for further action. There are no apparent problems with this strategy, however I would suggest for the team to elaborate and provide more details on the implementation. For example, it is not possible to understand what the javascript part will look like, how many functions will be used or how they will interact with html.",1215228,1,8021
"1)     The team has already identified the files to be changed, which is a good thing. It looks like, all changes will be handled in the client-side, so not applicable 2)     I assume, as it is nowhere mentioned, they would be writing a custom js file, the team plans to repeat some of the custom written code, if same functionality is required in 2 different file, which could violate DRY. Team might need to consider such possibility. 3)     NO, the team is already optimizing by leverage some JavaScript libraries. 4)     It would as user opts to sort, but here it seems to be a necessary evil. 5)     Yes, the team can elaborate more on their design approach and provide visual aids to help reader understand the sorting intended better.    ",1216024,1,8021
how to encapsulate that sorting table for future use?,1216735,1,8021
No UML diagram.,1215634,1,8021
"The author has not used any UML diagram, nor any other forms of pictorial representation. ",1217078,1,8021
"Although the textual explanation is succinct and nice, there's not yet diagrams or other visual aids available. I think a diagram that depicts the workflow might be very helpful.",1214935,1,8021
no visuals at all,1214843,1,8021
"Unfortunately the team has missed out on adding any visual aids to the document. I would suggest that where you list all the column names which would be sorted in each view, also add a screenshot of how that view looks at the present moment, and a low-fi sketch of how the view would look after the changes have been implemented.",1216379,1,8021
"The authors have not included any diagrams. Though the purpose and proposed changes are understood, the team could have mentioned use case diagrams or a flow chart explaining the flow of the functionality.",1216454,1,8021
"Although screenshots are available on the Projects page, it would have been easier to visualize if the page mockups were added in the design document too.",1216120,1,8021
No use of any visual aids.,1215259,1,8021
There are no diagrams present. It would have been great if a screenshot of a test case or flow diagram was given.,1216635,1,8021
Did not find any diagrams in the Wiki.,1215841,1,8021
"Although the write-up explains the things clearly, visual aids will leverage your proposed changes. Suggestions: You can include UML diagrams like use cases, application flow to elaborate more on your additional changes. You can mock the changes ( editing html page to show proposed changes) which will really help in a better understanding of your design.      ",1214930,1,8021
"Unfortunately no visual aids are provided in the design. I would suggest providing the simplified UML diagram that does not necessarily capture all of the classes that interact with the ones that will be modified by the team, but the ones that the team finds will be most relevant to the reader.",1215229,1,8021
NO UML diagram,1216025,1,8021
They have very well stated of about the purpose of their project. they have properly mentioned about the flow of their project which includes the flow chart for their project and also have specified of what kind of graphs they would prefer to show the visualization to the instructor. They have mentioned about how they will proceed in test case but haven't specified which files needs to be test inclusion of that would make the doc more complete,1215979,1,8090
"Wrtie up clearly explains the project purpose, what changes needs to be made, however including a mock test plan would have been better.",1215698,-1,8090
"Most of parts are included, but they should include more details in their doc.",1216999,1,8090
The team has a well composed design document. they have structured there design document into well written sub parts like design purpose and visualizations and files to be changed. They could have written there testing plan in a more elaborate manner by mentioning what kind of testing frame works will be used and what functionalities will be tested. The could have also added some use cases.,1216470,1,8090
The team has done a fantastic job in explaining the design in the initial stage. They have the current scenario and what they plan to do in the project.,1216994,-1,8029
It is extremely detailed!! Eagerly awaiting updates on implementation and on Code Snippets as and when they happen!,1217143,-1,8029
The design document is comprehensive and detailed. However there are several parts where the team is not yet sure of what exactly they want to. The document misses out on mention which model/controller they will be making changes to.,1216677,1,8029
Nice wiki page,1215275,-1,8029
The design doc is fulfilled and written pretty well.,1215195,-1,8029
The design doc is completed and gives exact information on what authors are gonna do.,1216971,-1,8029
" This wiki is dope. They analyze the requirements for the GitHub metrics they would need, and walked the reader through their design considerations. It seems like they have a thorough understanding about how to do this project.",1216867,-1,8029
Well done on adding almost everything. ,1216400,-1,8029
The document is complete. The authors have mentioned each functionality in detail. Also the test plan in explained thoroughly.,1216445,-1,8029
"The document is well-written. They have described the plan of action along with the different routes they would need to explore in order to complete the task at hand. They also gems that can be used and API to query if gems were not allowed. They have a section called the testing plan, however that doesn't look like a traditional testing plan. It just shows the navigation path that different users would take.",1215683,1,8029
"A very well written document, great job ",1215260,-1,8029
All the required part is in the document,1216792,-1,8029
"I think the diagrams shown include where you intend to add the metrics, but not how all the metrics will be incorporated, in the next phase make sure to include details for each of these :  Total number of commits. Number of files changed. Lines of Code added Lines of code modified. Lines of code deleted. LOCs that survived until final submission - (exclude from MVP due to the complexity and lower priority). ",1216995,1,8029
Yes. Detailed UI mockups were very impressive! The use case diagrams and explanations are well written!,1217144,-1,8029
"Yes, The document covers very required functionality.",1216678,-1,8029
Yes.,1215196,-1,8029
"Yes, it does",1216972,-1,8029
Get the GitHub pull metrics and show 'em to a person! That person being an instructor!,1216868,-1,8029
Yes,1216401,-1,8029
Includes all the functionality. ,1216446,-1,8029
The design doc does mention all of the functionality that the team is supposed to implement along with the different ways they can implement the same.,1215684,-1,8029
"Yes, as far as i understand the document cover all the functionality given mentioned. all the github metrics mentioned in the requirements doc  ",1215261,-1,8029
 The design contains all of the functionality required.  ,1216793,-1,8029
"The team has proposed many changes. Although, it is not clear which approach or what exact changes they plan to make.",1216996,1,8029
The explanation was perfectly organized and flowing. Could not have been any better! A sample request response of GitHub metric API would've made it more amazing!,1217145,-1,8029
"The authors do not mention the model they will be making additions to. I would suggest the team to consider a new controller, since adding new code to an existing controller may not be OO design.",1216679,1,8029
The authors proposed in a great detail.,1215197,-1,8029
Explanation is quite easy to understand.,1216973,-1,8029
" They clearly understand this software design process and Expertiza than me, so I trust their judgement.",1216869,-1,8029
Very good explanation and good work on giving alternatives. It would have been great if the team had added DB design as well but the work done is sufficient. ,1216402,1,8029
They authors have explained it well. They have also mentioned which gems eg Oktokit (Ruby toolkit for GitHub Api) that they plan on using.,1216447,-1,8029
The explanation given by the authors was pretty straightforward. Looking at the explanations it looks like the authors have thought about different aspects of the problem statement and also of different ways to implement the GitHub metrics integration feature along with the side effects of implementing it in a particular way. e.g one would think that adding the metrics to the database would be a sound solution but given the nature of an open source project and the fact that students would commit beyond the deadline the authors have thought not to add the metrics to the database which is sound and reasonable.,1215685,-1,8029
very good. authors have provided all explanations with adequate screen shots and now and after screens ,1215262,-1,8029
 The team explained them design very well. It is easy to follow their idea.  ,1216794,-1,8029
They have listed various possibilities to get the task done. The Use Case and UML diagrams also help here. Suggestion : Please add the places where you want to make/have made the changes. ,1216997,1,8029
The authors mention gems that they could potentially use. but they do not mention where they'd be adding the associated code.,1216680,1,8029
No problem found. They are trying to implement the DRY principle.,1215198,-1,8029
"As far as I can tell, it does not appear that the authors will add unnecessary classes and potentially smell up the code base.",1216870,-1,8029
Design is good.,1216403,-1,8029
The design is well explained. Need clarification on below: 1) How will this GitHub metrics will be used to grade the student. So how will the final marks for a particular be calculated using the data from GitHub.,1216448,1,8029
The design seems to be good. It is still not very clear of the path for implementation or the files that they plan to add and the methods in said files however that is fine considering that this is just the initial stage and not much can be said since we haven't advanced to the implementation stage yet.  The authors seem to doubt whether they are allowed to use any existing gem. I think they should go ahead and use the gems.,1215686,1,8029
class level details are missing but i suspect that can be because this is the first phase doc. they have mentioned use of existing gems that need investigation,1215263,1,8029
 All the design looks reasonable right now.  ,1216795,-1,8029
The team has done a wonderful job in including UML diagrams and visual aids.,1216998,-1,8029
The visual aids have been well put together. ,1216681,-1,8029
The chart is also in a great detail.,1215199,-1,8029
Visual aids are present which perfectly helps us explain the plan authors have proposed.  ,1216975,-1,8029
 Super legit use case diagrams. Some of their pictures even had colours! I liked that!,1216871,-1,8029
Proper use case diagram have been added. For next submission team can add UML diagrams.,1216404,1,8029
Uses UML diagrams and images to explain where the changes will be made.,1216449,-1,8029
There are different diagrams being used: 1. Use case diagram which describes the flow of how different users would navigate to the GitHub metric pages. 2. Mockup of their implementation which details the presence of a separate tab for GitHub metrics integration. They also plan to add some graphs which i think would be very useful to the instructors.,1215687,-1,8029
Yes the doc has use case diagrams and screen shots. this is very good and eases understanding,1215264,-1,8029
 Both the use case diagram and the screenshot they provide helped me understand their purpose.  ,1216796,-1,8029
The Design document states all the required things right from project design to test plan. Files that will be changed along with how functionality will work/flow are included in the doc clearly.  Suggestion: great work! no suggestions required.,1216187,-1,8048
" The problem statements are much detailed, but they could be more concise. The test plan could probably be elaborated for better explanation. ",1216212,1,8048
the design covers all tthe major aspects well. I feel that the testing plan could be explained and elaborated in a much better way.,1215345,1,8048
The design doc is complete. All the relevant sections have been added.,1215673,-1,8048
Document looks complete.,1217095,-1,8048
"The wiki explains the problem statement very well along with the proposed solution which seems reasonable. But the wiki does not include any test plans as of now. There are a few test cases which can be used to write the test plan, for eg. not adding drop deadline for the assignment itself and assigning each topic a drop deadline and check the behaviour of the system.",1215200,1,8048
"The design doc clearly explains the project purpose, project design and the test plan.",1215435,-1,8048
"Design is very nicely explained with flowchart makes the design flow very clear. Suggestion : If a screenshot of actual screen where the change needs to be made is added, that would be perfect.",1214971,-1,8048
The document is quite comprehensive in its descriptions of the design proposal.,1215885,-1,8048
"Design document has all the necessary information like project design, test plan. The team has gone through their topic deeply and can be seen by their illustration of their implementation. Also, they have included code snippets which show thoroughness of their approach ",1216091,-1,8048
The design documents contain all required part. ,1216797,-1,8048
Impressive write-up. Flow-charts and UML diagrams are well-explained. Detailed explanation of problem statement and solution to be implemented.,1216722,-1,8048
lack of group members.  The design process is not very clear.,1215415,1,8048
"Yes, the document incorporates all the functionality,ensuring nothing is missed.",1216188,-1,8048
The design incorporates all the required functionality to a good extent.,1215346,-1,8048
"Yes, it does.",1215674,-1,8048
The doc focusses on eliminating the issue and does not shower any light on the design of the system.,1215201,1,8048
Yes the design incorporates all the functionality required. All the issues are explained clearly and their required solutions are also given.,1215436,-1,8048
Yes all the issues mentioned in the project description are covered along with their proposed Solution. Good Job,1214972,-1,8048
"Design document has outlined the project requirement and issues. They have proposed a solution to each problem. they have even figured the files and methods to be modified. Overall, it looks good.",1216092,-1,8048
The design contains all of the functionality that required. ,1216798,-1,8048
"Yes, it is complete",1216723,-1,8048
The explanation provided is on point to the requirement of the project. All the steps piece up the project completely. No suggestions.,1216189,-1,8048
The overall quality of explanations is precise and clear. Isssue 3 and the test plan can be addressed in more detail. How the testing will be performed must be addressed.,1215347,1,8048
The Issue 2 explanation ans Issue 1 solution 2 explanation is a bit hard to follow or seems to be at a high level. It needs to be broken down. All other descriptions are easy to follow. It would have been more helpful if some screenshots of the tables or the screen shots of the screens were included.,1215675,1,8048
"Very clear, very well organized.",1217097,-1,8048
proposed changes are well explanatory but every function change is in sign_up_sheet controller whereas there are many references present in a few models and other controllers as well,1215202,1,8048
"The explanations given show that they have put thought into their project however in Issue 1 solution 2, they are not clear about the path ahead. They have vaguely stated that the solution might be complex.",1215437,1,8048
The flowchart makes it very clear.,1214973,-1,8048
Everything is explained well and easy to understand.,1215887,-1,8048
The team has explained the solution with flow charts and code snippets. They have even considered the feasibility of their solution which is a good thing as this is a big project so feasibility is a big factor. ,1216093,-1,8048
They explained their plan very well. Both the visual aid and the word they use are very clear. ,1216799,-1,8048
Adequate information given on implementing the solution. Flow charts are impressive.,1216724,-1,8048
Great efforts have been taken to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it. The design will definitely increase the response time. Suggestion: Information about the methods that will be implemented is not given in the design document Availability of such info would have been helpful.,1216190,-1,8048
The only issue i feel is iapproach to issue 1 is a bit  complex  or not clear which may lead to increasing the response time of the system.,1215348,1,8048
"Though I couldn't follow everything, overall, the design seems to do the right thing.",1215676,-1,8048
As stated above all the references needs to be checked as signup sheet controller is populating the database and every field should be available to maintain consistency.,1215203,-1,8048
" More effort could have been expended on the design because in some places, they are not sure of the direction and just state that they might have to look into the code and discuss with the professor.",1215438,1,8048
There is nothing wrong in current design. Looks good. Suggestion: However Since I have already worked on a similar assignment so I know that similar issue has already been resolved for drop topic deadline. You can reuse the entire code and just change deadline type. Have a look at OSS project topic- 1843.  Check with the Professor once.,1214974,-1,8048
All proposed changes seem to be in line with good coding practices and the expertiza system guidelines.,1215888,-1,8048
Their solution sounds good. ,1216094,-1,8048
The design they have right now looks good to me. It does not have any issue. ,1216800,-1,8048
not show which method,1215418,-1,8048
The use of flowcharts describe the functioning of the project exceptionally. Suggestion: Including screen mockups to your doc will add more weight to it.,1216191,-1,8048
Clearly defined UML (+1),1216216,-1,8048
Uml diagrams mentioned are excellent and to the mark.,1215349,-1,8048
The UML diagrams does seems to be a bit at a high level. I couldn't get a clear idea of how it would actually be implemented.,1215677,1,8048
Diagrams are very clear and well explained!,1217099,-1,8048
No diagrams shown,1215204,-1,8048
One of the best wikis I have reviewed with good diagrams and explanations. The flow diagrams are really good. Kudos,1215439,-1,8048
The diagrams follow the conventions and are detailed and self explanatory. Suggestion : Test Plan is not so clear. Especially the second testcase where it is stated that the dates will be changed accordingly. What dates will be changed and how should be mentioned. A similar flow-chart  will make it very clear as to what you plan to test. ,1214975,1,8048
The flowcharts used are very good and do a great job of conveying the intended purpose of each solution presented.,1215889,-1,8048
They have used UML diagram and flowcharts which aided in understanding their approach and the logic,1216095,-1,8048
Their visual aid is well designed and high quality. It helps the reader understand their total design very well. ,1216801,-1,8048
UML diagrams are well formed. Flow charts are easy to understand. Looks like the team has thoroughly understood the problem statement. ,1216726,-1,8048
no such things like UML.,1215419,-1,8048
"The design document looks really good. All sections are properly described, screenshots included. A possible uml or workflow diagram would have been appreciated.",1215420,-1,8071
All the features are mentioned in the design document. It explains the background and the approach that they are going to take to create the view aggregating all the information.,1216415,-1,8071
Very well maintained and explained,1216600,-1,8071
The document is complete and well structured. They have also incorporated the prototype comments and mentor's feedback. ,1215295,-1,8071
"This documentation is the first one to clearly give a background for the project, out of all the documentations that I have reviewed until now. Kudos to the team for taking that extra mile. They have clarified the purpose of this project under the Task heading as: to provide a holistic insight into the performance of each student in a class as an objective. The project design includes the view and controller section that projects the requirements of the project. I like how the team has listed all the information to be presented in the Grade Summary. The documentation finally contains the Test plan, where they propose to do controller tests to check if the correct model method is called and if the objects of appropriate datatype are returned and also if the correct view is rendered. They have also listed 2 feature tests to see if the correct information is being rendered on the view. The team could have added more such tests like: to test if the sorting functionality works fine",1216961,-1,8071
The document is well made with necessary snapshots.,1216227,-1,8071
The design doc submitted is pretty neat and contains all the necessary information to understand the requirements of the project.,1216405,-1,8071
The design doc is clear and well written. The authors have done a great job explaining the project's purpose and their design plan with the use of LoFi sketch and prototype for the required view. I would suggest the team to include files that are involved for this project. Overall good work!,1215230,-1,8071
The design doc is complete and clearly includes all details about the project.,1215653,-1,8071
"Complete, and well-explained. Impressed by 'Background' paragraph. Also, the screenshot of problem statement and solution is thorough.",1216485,-1,8071
This design documentation is very crisp and clear. Explained in detail and well organized.,1214743,-1,8071
"Yes, the design document does incorporate all the functionality. There are proposed test plans, so expecting more screenshots with test cases in it.",1215421,-1,8071
Yes. It includes all the functionality.,1216416,-1,8071
Yes. it incorporates with the functionality ,1216601,-1,8071
yes,1215296,-1,8071
The design does incorporate all of the functionalities. One suggestion that I can give in the context of the design is that the documentation could have covered the list of files that they plan to work on and the current version of that code. They could have shown a UML diagram of the flow of activities for a lucid understandability ,1216962,-1,8071
"Yes, according to the given link, the design has incorporated all the requirements and mentioned their test plan as well",1216406,-1,8071
"The design incorporates all the primary functionality, however adding a UML diagram would make it much better",1215654,-1,8071
"Yes, I do not find any information missing.",1216486,-1,8071
The authors have incorporated all the functionalities required.,1214744,-1,8071
"The proposed changes look good, explanations are clear. Also, mentioned the continuous talk with mentor to come up with a prototype. Suggest you to include screenshots of some positive and negative tests in the future submissions.  ",1215422,-1,8071
Adequate explanation is provided. They also mention what tests are feasible to be performed.,1216417,-1,8071
"yes, all of them are implemented with good quality of explanation",1216602,-1,8071
Explanations are very clear and simple to understand.,1215297,-1,8071
"The authors have proposed to create a view for Grade Summary with the details pertaining to the assignment grades, topics, review scores and total scores for each student which gets rendered when a 360 Assessment tab icon is clicked. This change seems logical. They have also depicted a LowFI sketch of the projected page and screenshot of a rough prototype. These changes seem logical to me. I wonder if they are going to reuse any existing code that they cited as prior work in the background. The documentation could have added specifics of the files that they wish to modify or create.",1216963,1,8071
"The explanation is good, and they have managed to get in a prototype UI as well. My only concern with the design is, if there are a lot of assignments the page might become very wide and will require a horizontal scroll bar to access all the data for the user.",1216229,1,8071
The proposed implementation design is elaborate and clearly defines what the team plans on doing. ,1216407,-1,8071
Got confused in between about the proposed solution,1214801,1,8071
"The explanations are succinct. However, in the Controllers section, it is unclear which controller in expertiza project the authors are referring to. The authors could mention the name of the controller(s) they intend to change and also possible method(s) that might be added to it. ",1215232,1,8071
The explanation is good and more information on which files would be changed would be more helpful.,1215655,-1,8071
Very well explained solution with LoFi sketch.,1216487,-1,8071
The explanation is very detailed and easy to understand. ,1214745,-1,8071
The team has proposed a prototype where in the code might have some kinds of sorting of data. I hope the code for this does not violate the DRY principle in any case.,1215423,1,8071
Design appears to be good.  ,1216418,-1,8071
Well designed,1216603,-1,8071
Proper design as well as test features are mentioned.,1215298,-1,8071
"The authors have not specified any implementation specific detail pertaining to the specific controller classes that they propose to modify. So I am not in a position to comment if they are making changes in the wrong class or if it will make the code smelly. The design looks precise and there is no need of any additional gems.  The response time of the system should typically not take so long unless the view is rendering extraordinarily many student and assignment information. The team could implement an effective searching algorithm or use of an efficient data structure to store the student grade information. Or, they could possibly use filters to generate only relevant students (say under a specific course, year at a given University ) The authors have put in good effort in the design documentation except for minor additions (like code modifications, file changes and UML diagrams) which can be easily incorporated by the next review.",1216964,1,8071
They might like to elaborate more on how they plan to use the hash of students to retrieve the specific information of the assignments. For eg. what models will you be using to query the DB.,1216230,1,8071
"According to me, the given design incorporates all the expected outcomes without disturbing the current functionality.",1216408,-1,8071
"The overall look of the page is well explained. However, I could not understand the back-end design plan, as in how/where the team will be adding such features in the code.",1215233,1,8071
"The authors view of the final result is clear, but it is not yet clear on how the project is going to be implemented. i.e what files are going to be changed.",1215656,1,8071
Looks like a lot of effort will go into the VIEW,1214812,-1,8071
"This is the only place I found the authors could improve. There is no mention of the actual files that need to be modified. They have detailed out the change that they propose, but no mention of actual files and the code change. It would be further increase the clarity of the solution if you could include that too.",1214746,1,8071
The diagrams are missing in the document. Although much of it is explained in the screenshots. A possible diagram would make the document stronger.,1215424,1,8071
The document explains where the changes will be made and also gives screenshots of the appropriate views.,1216419,-1,8071
Screenshots are helpful to understand the flow,1216604,-1,8071
Screenshots and visual ques are provided to the user,1215299,-1,8071
The authors have put in a good amount of effort in creating LowFI sketch (table) of the Grade Summary view with mock data. They have included a rough prototype of the intended view with all student and assignment information. The documentation also shows the Manage Courses view which contains the 360 Assessment icon that links to the Grade Summary page. One suggestion is that the team could have touched upon some implementation detail like showing the code flow as a flowchart or even useful UML diagrams for usecases.,1216965,1,8071
Missing a UML. But loved the addition of the LoFI sketch.,1216231,1,8071
"The team hasn't put any diagram to explain their design, they've just explained it theoretically.",1216409,1,8071
"The doc does not have any UML diagrams. However, the use of mockup screens are helpful to understand what the project is about.",1215234,1,8071
The screenshots posted on the wiki page provide a clear picture of what the team seeks to achieve.,1215657,-1,8071
Very well explained with sketches and UML diagrams. The diagrams are detailed and easy to understand.,1216489,-1,8071
"Even thought there aren't any UML diagrams, the team has added a wire frame design of the proposed page and it has helped in visualizing the solution.",1214747,-1,8071
Yes.,1214917,-1,8039
No detaiiled design on how to do proposed solution no visuals ,1214844,1,8045
"Both the project purpose and the project design are not very well stated.  In terms of project purpose, although I was expecting it to appear in the introduction part, it actually did not. The part just stated a high-level abstract goal, being transmitting the conflicting message to the grader. But it's not at all stated in detail. So I went to the proposed solution to find the project purpose. In the proposed solution section, Neither project purpose nor project design was well put. It talks about changes that are expected to be implemented in the file. But they are not talked about in detail. This sentence: ""loop through each review not for calculating the average but to compare the new review score with each review score""    seems to be not so easy to be understood. The project design seems also to be in the proposed solution section. There's no detailed modification plan, workflow statement, or anything.  The testing plan looks succinct and helpful enough for a tester to use and check the functionality. ",1214951,1,8045
"The requirement here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Br9hm-SWIvl5ibWSfRVjmiYTQl5j27l8slWhv2iUCqQ/edit#heading=h.654oe3xw5p73  totally appeared in the design document. This is very good because there's a high-level goal being stated. However, the ""important files"" part which includes the Open github issue, delayed mailer, response controller and response model, only model is mentioned and the other four are not mentioned at all. It should be great if all of these can be mentioned.",1214952,1,8045
There's no diagrams or any other visual aids available. I would suggest adding at least some workflow diagram.,1214955,1,8045
"5) more effort should be expended on the design. I think there are a lot of problems in the design. The changes to the controller, where the notification is implemented, such questions are not addressed. Also, the questions listed in the above answers are not addressed.",1214954,1,8045
"The changes being proposed is not comprehensive. The changes in the controller is not mentioned at all. The current issue and end picture are also very hard to follow. I have the following questions: 1. How will the UI look like when the conflict- mentioning implementation is resolved? Or only email notification and no changes in the UI? 2. I cannot understand clearly the meaning of this sentence: ""loop through each review not for calculating the average but to compare the new review score with each review score"".",1214953,1,8045
"The team has well explained the problem statement along with the application flow which makes it easier to understand about the project. They has also described the method which discusses their proposed implementation. However, it would be helpful to add more details on the design approach they have chosen. The team has also proposed a short test plan on a very high level, which makes senses as this is very early level of the project, but its suggested to add more diverse test cases to it as it would help in handling all the cases during the development of functionality of  self review extension.",1215663,1,8104
The design related information is missing. The team has mentioned the problem statement and application flow. They need to add UML diagrams and in the first stage at least the proposed changes are expected.,1214849,1,8104
"The design documents looks very crisp and clear. The work flow, proposed solutions and test plans are all listed. Good work. A screenshot or two of the test cases would have made it even better.",1215410,1,8104
The problem statement is not clear,1215280,1,8104
"The design document is good which covers every aspects from project purpose to the test cases . However, there are some things which I found incomplete. In the problem statement they should first of mention a proper definition  of what is meant by self review as the term is a bit ambiguous and in the flow diagram they have mentioned the flow which represents the UI aspect of the the project and not the flow of how the task would be implemented and thus the flow diagram must be changed ",1216011,1,8104
The doc is well written with all the necessary explanation. More detailed test plan would suffice the need of the document,1216757,1,8104
"I don't think anything is missing from their document, but it is in general ""lite"". I would prefer a few more details on how they plan to limit reviews from being viewed until a self-review is complete, or which places they plan on making changes. ",1214896,1,8104
"The problem statement is nicely explained with the help of flowchart. However some screenshot of the screens where changes need to be made as well a similar flow diagram for solution will be helpful. Test Plan is not stated in details. It just mentions Bullet Points.  In Test Driven Development, adequately defining the test cases is as important as developing a solution as per the problem statement. This should be corrected.",1217034,1,8104
There are no sections titled project design or project purpose.,1216610,1,8104
The project is complete and sound enough in its approach and the implementations and the test plan has been well devised and just shy of application.,1215405,-1,8104
No everything is properly described.,1216565,-1,8104
The doc is very succinct and well written!  ,1216192,-1,8104

Visual aids are absent from the write-up. Suggestions: Use cases for email notification can be added. Template/design of the new/modified email can be added.  Any relevant design pattern diagram can be added.,1215000,1,8045
The team has included all the topics required for the documentation.,1215310,-1,8045
The team has discussed the solution which is required for fixing the issue but has not proposed any design for their approach.,1215664,1,8104
The authors have explained the changes in a brief manner which are easy to understand,1215312,-1,8045
"The explanation is descriptive and explains the logic behind the solution which is think should work. However, I believe that team should can add the explanation about the files and classes they tend to make changes in. The team can now focus on implementation of the code.",1215313,-1,8045
"In my opinion, they have included the application flow but where in Expertiza they are implementing this logic seems to be missing. They should include the same in round 2 when they have completed the implementation.",1214850,1,8104
Unfortunately the visual aids are missing.,1215314,1,8045

Yes all the requirements mentioned in the Problem Statement are considered. Also the corresponding solutions are explained . A flow diagram or screenshots explaining the solution jsut like the problem statement is explained would have been helpful.,1217035,1,8104
Could have been explained more,1215385,1,8045
"Yes, their sections Method to calculate Composite Score and Application Flow sections have a flow chart as well as at least a targeted section of the code which they have planned to work upon. ",1215406,-1,8104
Not descriptive,1215386,1,8045
"No, not all, but major of all functionalities.",1216566,-1,8104
Not much described to rate over,1215387,1,8045
The design incorporates all of the functionality required. ,1216813,-1,8104
Needs to work a bit on the plan,1215388,1,8045
No diagrams to refer to,1215389,1,8045
The team has suggested reasonable changes to address the problem statement and has given explanation for each solution they have proposed for the implementation.,1215665,-1,8104
"Yes, in my opinion the team has understood the topic well and clearly listed all the functionality as described in the design document. Good Job !!",1215808,-1,8045
"The authors do not have a section for proposed changes. Hence, it is not completely clear which changes they are proposing and which changes are already existing. ",1214851,1,8104
"The project purpose is well defined and clearly explains what this project aims to do. The team also identifies the strategies they wish to adopt to fix the issue. This explanation is clear and concise. However, I would also suggest the team to add a basic test plan, on how they would test the functionality they add. Also I suggest them to list down the list of files they would be changing.",1215807,-1,8045
The explanations are good. But a layout in the issue-solution form listed sequentially would have looked better.,1215412,1,8104
"The authors propose changes in an extremely concise manner. The idea that the team proposes to follow seems logical, but I would suggest them to include a dummy example or sample pseudocode so that the english explanantion is backed up with an idea of the code as well. Such as this-: 1) Review X is submitted 2) Loop through Review 1......n If abs(Review n score - Review X score) >= (some value) store Review n URL in list  ",1215809,-1,8045
The author has given a proper explanation of how the things will be implemented by specifying the files that needs to be modified along with how they are going to merge the grades,1216013,1,8104
"The authors propose a sound logic to improve the functionality required. However, I would suggest the team to think about looping over each and every review. This may increase the response time of the system. Perhaps more interaction with the instructors could help the team come up with a less complex solution.",1215810,-1,8045
"The team has not provided any visual representation of the work they propose to do. Perhaps the pseudocode mentioned above, could instead be shown as a set of diagrams showing an example for how this fucntionality would be handled when one say 1 Review has a score disparity of more than the threshold for existing 2-3 reviews. The idea here is not to add working screenshots, but a Low-Fi diagram would also help in making the documentation visually more representative.",1215811,1,8045
The changes are much that is required just some calculated approach of the score which the author has mentioned and seems will be working,1216759,-1,8104
The document seems complete.,1216036,-1,8045
"Similar to my earlier comment, I found this document lacking on details. I also don't think their explanation for deriving the ""score"" to be sufficient. Their explanation is expressed as code, not as a mathematical equation.",1214898,1,8104
Some screenshots of actual emails sent and proposed format of the new email would be helpful,1216040,1,8045
"Could be more specific, especially with test plan.",1216167,-1,8045
Just overview is presented which is explained properly. The technical design is not explained in depth.,1217036,-1,8104
Changes are not proposed to a suitable extent as they have mostly elaborated on the problem statement. It yet remains for them to implement them and explain in explicit details their action plan to arrive at the solution.  ,1215407,1,8104
"The design is rather straightforward, incorporates all the functionality required.",1216456,-1,8045
Changes are suggested in a well manner but could have been explained in more details.,1216567,-1,8104
"The explanations are brief and to the point, thought that seems to be due to the nature of the problem statement itself.",1216457,-1,8045
The changes are clearly stated and represented. ,1216194,-1,8104
"The new design loops through all existing reviews to compare new review scores with the original ones, and stores the URL of a specific iteration if its limit is exceeded. By waiting for all reviews to be looped in before sending email, it may increase the response time of the system.",1216458,1,8045
"I think you explained the change they want to make clear, but maybe you can state which file you want to make and how you guys want to change that file. ",1216814,1,8104
"No visual aids, UML diagrams, or table/screen mockups were provided.",1216459,1,8045
"The team has discussed the implementation details of calculating the composite score. However, as stated above the documentation lacks the detailed design that they are planning to implement.",1215666,1,8104
"Yes, they include project purpose, project design, and testing plan. It's a little short. It's suggested that add more details.  ",1216777,-1,8045
They have mentioned the method to calculate the composite reviews. But where this method is planned to be added in Expertiza is unclear. This needs to be mentioned.,1214852,1,8104
"Yes, they include all the functionality in the wiki page. They can work it better if they add more details and some visual aids.",1216778,-1,8045
The design appears to be complete.,1216780,-1,8045
They did explain what they want to do. It's easy to understand and seems reasonable. They can make it more explicit and clear by making it step by step.,1216779,-1,8045
"It would have been good to show the comparison of the scores calculated with the old model and the new model. This will check if the proposed design is acceptable or just falls in the ""smell"" category.",1215413,1,8104
The design appears to be perfect for now  except for the flow diagram,1216014,-1,8104
This design is good. There are no visual aids. Maybe they can consider use it to make it more detailed.,1216781,-1,8045
The design gives a proper explanation of the behavior of the system/functionality,1216760,-1,8104
The design covers the functionalities but there seem to be no concrete solutions for the same. Some more explanations is expected.,1216773,-1,8045
"From what I can gather, nothing sounds too complicated individually, but the practice of a workflow across multiple pages can become very cumbersome and complex. I don't see any details on how this team plans to mitigate those issues.",1214899,1,8104
Although it looks like a good start the team can still improve on the design by adding a UML diagram and a test plan. There is a need for a low-level design explanation so that others can understand the technical details of the implementation.,1216772,-1,8045
Just few high-level details (very generic) are provided which makes it hard to visualize a solution,1216774,1,8045
The design is specified to a certain extent but does not provide where the changes will take place or what classes or tables will be affected.,1216775,1,8045
This logic to calculate composite score : composite score= Max score -[self review score - peer review score] is basically taking the min scores. Not sure what you are trying to achieve here . It is not a good measure to calculate composite score.,1217037,1,8104
No UML Diagram is provided so can't comment.,1216776,1,8045
"Need improvements, can add design by adding UML diagrams and Test Plans.  Technical details with class diagram to explain the code level implementation would have been better.",1216782,1,8045
Have explained the project as according to the given description.,1216783,-1,8045
Solution and class level details are missing.,1216784,1,8045
The design explains much of the detail about the problem but classes which will be affected or needs changes are not provided.,1216785,1,8045
NO UML diagram is provided so cant comment.,1216786,-1,8045
"The purpose, design are missing in their doc, so it not good.",1217014,1,8045
"As for the designs proposed by the authors it proves to be a redundant check since there is a minimal amount of Design aspect in their doc.  Sure, they have defined an application flow, but that is all there is to it.  1. Nothing about adding a method to any class has been suggested. Only a simple formula for composite score has been written.  2. The design hasn't been implemented to the depth to make it a code let alone make it smelly.  3. Nothing mentioned about the design to make it complicated and the piece of code which they would delve into to ascertain of any pre-existing gems for simplification.  4. This too is hard to reach a conclusion on since not enough details to answer it with certainty.  5. Yes. Absolutely, a much more thorough investigation should be carried out and relevant previous work exploration with help solve the cause.",1215408,1,8104
"No, many functionality are missing in their design.",1217015,1,8045
"Frankly, I can not see their concrete designs from their doc. ",1217017,1,8045
"Yes, the designs appears to be good to me. I believe the diagram shown in wiki helped me to understand their understanding",1216568,-1,8104
The design looks reasonable for me. ,1216815,-1,8104
Their explanations are not detailed and sometimes it's not easy to understand.,1217016,1,8045
They did not write or add proper visual aids to help readers to understand.,1217018,1,8045
The team has provided the application flow diagram which helps to understand the working of the project. It would be helpful to add design details and the diagram for same so that others can understand the implementation as well.,1215667,1,8104
Application flow is present and done well. UML diagrams need to be added.,1214853,1,8104
The application plan diagram has been shown. It distinguishes between Instructor and Student.,1215414,-1,8104
As mentioned above the flow diagram should be completely modified ,1216015,1,8104
Diagrams are explanatory but few but I think they are sufficient,1216761,1,8104
Although it looks like a good start the team can still improve on the design by adding a UML diagram and a test plan. There is a need for a low-level design explanation so that others can understand the technical details of the implementation.,1216772,1,8032
No clarification,1215315,1,8032
"Same comments as earlier. A flow chart diagram is provided, but it provides little benefit and the presentation for the score algorithm is vague and simple. I would like to see more details about the process in an actor diagram.",1214900,1,8104
No UML diagrams or screenshots have been included currently.,1217038,1,8104
No detaiiled design on how to do proposed solution no visuals ,1214844,1,8032
I really like the flow graphs! The helped me understand what you are aiming to do.,1216614,-1,8104
"Both the project purpose and the project design are not very well stated.  In terms of project purpose, although I was expecting it to appear in the introduction part, it actually did not. The part just stated a high-level abstract goal, being transmitting the conflicting message to the grader. But it's not at all stated in detail. So I went to the proposed solution to find the project purpose. In the proposed solution section, Neither project purpose nor project design was well put. It talks about changes that are expected to be implemented in the file. But they are not talked about in detail. This sentence: ""loop through each review not for calculating the average but to compare the new review score with each review score""    seems to be not so easy to be understood. The project design seems also to be in the proposed solution section. There's no detailed modification plan, workflow statement, or anything.  The testing plan looks succinct and helpful enough for a tester to use and check the functionality. ",1214951,1,8032
"Could be more specific, especially with test plan.",1216167,1,8032
There is a hint of visual aid in terms of the section of Application flow for the Instructor and student and thus we can say that it does slightly help get a sense of putting things into perspective.  1. None. Both the diagrams seem important enough for the scope of the project and in conjunction with the intended functionalities. 2. The UML diagram is in line with the conventions and follows suite. 3. The diagram of the instructor can be said to be bordering on one to be too high level and should go a bit more into detail.  ,1215409,1,8104
"The project purpose is well defined and clearly explains what this project aims to do. The team also identifies the strategies they wish to adopt to fix the issue.

The document is complete. The authors have mentioned each functionality in detail. Also the test plan in explained thoroughly.,1216445,-1,8026
"The document is well-written. They have described the plan of action along with the different routes they would need to explore in order to complete the task at hand. They also gems that can be used and API to query if gems were not allowed. They have a section called the testing plan, however that doesn't look like a traditional testing plan. It just shows the navigation path that different users would take.",1215683,1,8026
"A very well written document, great job ",1215260,-1,8026
All the required part is in the document,1216792,-1,8026
"I think the diagrams shown include where you intend to add the metrics, but not how all the metrics will be incorporated, in the next phase make sure to include details for each of these :  Total number of commits. Number of files changed. Lines of Code added Lines of code modified. Lines of code deleted. LOCs that survived until final submission - (exclude from MVP due to the complexity and lower priority). ",1216995,1,8026
Yes. Detailed UI mockups were very impressive! The use case diagrams and explanations are well written!,1217144,-1,8026
"Yes, The document covers very required functionality.",1216678,-1,8026
Yes.,1215196,-1,8026
"Yes, it does",1216972,-1,8026
Get the GitHub pull metrics and show 'em to a person! That person being an instructor!,1216868,-1,8026
Yes,1216401,-1,8026
Includes all the functionality. ,1216446,-1,8026
The design doc does mention all of the functionality that the team is supposed to implement along with the different ways they can implement the same.,1215684,-1,8026
"Yes, as far as i understand the document cover all the functionality given mentioned. all the github metrics mentioned in the requirements doc  ",1215261,-1,8026
 The design contains all of the functionality required.  ,1216793,-1,8026
"The team has proposed many changes. Although, it is not clear which approach or what exact changes they plan to make.",1216996,1,8026
The explanation was perfectly organized and flowing. Could not have been any better! A sample request response of GitHub metric API would've made it more amazing!,1217145,-1,8026
"The authors do not mention the model they will be making additions to. I would suggest the team to consider a new controller, since adding new code to an existing controller may not be OO design.",1216679,1,8026
The authors proposed in a great detail.,1215197,-1,8026
Explanation is quite easy to understand.,1216973,-1,8026
" They clearly understand this software design process and Expertiza than me, so I trust their judgement.",1216869,-1,8026
Very good explanation and good work on giving alternatives. It would have been great if the team had added DB design as well but the work done is sufficient. ,1216402,-1,8026
They authors have explained it well. They have also mentioned which gems eg Oktokit (Ruby toolkit for GitHub Api) that they plan on using.,1216447,-1,8026
The explanation given by the authors was pretty straightforward. Looking at the explanations it looks like the authors have thought about different aspects of the problem statement and also of different ways to implement the GitHub metrics integration feature along with the side effects of implementing it in a particular way. e.g one would think that adding the metrics to the database would be a sound solution but given the nature of an open source project and the fact that students would commit beyond the deadline the authors have thought not to add the metrics to the database which is sound and reasonable.,1215685,-1,8026
very good. authors have provided all explanations with adequate screen shots and now and after screens ,1215262,-1,8026
 The team explained them design very well. It is easy to follow their idea.  ,1216794,-1,8026
They have listed various possibilities to get the task done. The Use Case and UML diagrams also help here. Suggestion : Please add the places where you want to make/have made the changes. ,1216997,1,8026
The authors mention gems that they could potentially use. but they do not mention where they'd be adding the associated code.,1216680,1,8026
No problem found. They are trying to implement the DRY principle.,1215198,-1,8026
"As far as I can tell, it does not appear that the authors will add unnecessary classes and potentially smell up the code base.",1216870,-1,8026
Design is good.,1216403,-1,8026
The design is well explained. Need clarification on below: 1) How will this GitHub metrics will be used to grade the student. So how will the final marks for a particular be calculated using the data from GitHub.,1216448,1,8026
The design seems to be good. It is still not very clear of the path for implementation or the files that they plan to add and the methods in said files however that is fine considering that this is just the initial stage and not much can be said since we haven't advanced to the implementation stage yet.  The authors seem to doubt whether they are allowed to use any existing gem. I think they should go ahead and use the gems.,1215686,1,8026
class level details are missing but i suspect that can be because this is the first phase doc. they have mentioned use of existing gems that need investigation,1215263,1,8026
 All the design looks reasonable right now.  ,1216795,-1,8026
The team has done a wonderful job in including UML diagrams and visual aids.,1216998,-1,8026
The visual aids have been well put together. ,1216681,-1,8026
The chart is also in a great detail.,1215199,-1,8026
Visual aids are present which perfectly helps us explain the plan authors have proposed.  ,1216975,-1,8026
 Super legit use case diagrams. Some of their pictures even had colours! I liked that!,1216871,-1,8026
Proper use case diagram have been added. For next submission team can add UML diagrams.,1216404,-1,8026
Uses UML diagrams and images to explain where the changes will be made.,1216449,-1,8026
There are different diagrams being used: 1. Use case diagram which describes the flow of how different users would navigate to the GitHub metric pages. 2. Mockup of their implementation which details the presence of a separate tab for GitHub metrics integration. They also plan to add some graphs which i think would be very useful to the instructors.,1215687,-1,8026
Yes the doc has use case diagrams and screen shots. this is very good and eases understanding,1215264,-1,8026
 Both the use case diagram and the screenshot they provide helped me understand their purpose.  ,1216796,-1,8026
" This seems complete to me. They have the introduction with a purpose and problem, a ui mockup, and use cases. It does seem odd that the use cases are listed in the test plan.",1216787,1,8047
The purpose of the project is very clear and well outlined. The project design seems to be barely mentioned. There have been mentions of the word 'API' but not which one. So reading the doc I have no clue of how they are going to implement this. However I do know the files that they are going to modify. The test plan has been written in the form of cucumber user stories. I am not entirely sure if it is the correct approach.,1216121,1,8047
"The document specifies the problem statement and the ""analyze"" functionality they want to incorporate. However, the design document seems to be incomplete as they have not talked about the exact identified functionality i.e ""analyze"" and the design document section is empty. Suggestion : You can talk about methods you want to add or existing methods you want to modify and how. I think that you can remove the expertiza introduction section as mentioned by the professor.    ",1216852,1,8047
The design document mentions nothing about evaluation of how long the API takes to return with a JSON.,1214825,1,8047
Few information is missing like specification on NLP and how exactly the implementation would be. Idea is fine but add more details to it.,1215626,1,8047
The design incorporates most of the functionality but it would be better if the actual design is discussed more clearly.,1216863,1,8047
"The authors have provided a high level solution to the problem statement.  They have mentioned that they are going to use an API for suggestion detection, but have not yet identified one. Suggestion: You can survey on the existing APIs and discuss about at least two of them in depth and specify which one you feel is more compatible with expertiza. This will improve your write-up significantly.",1216853,1,8047
The explanation of how the received data will be stored/presented is something I would suggest the team to add. The design document also misses out on where the data will be presented in the view.,1214826,1,8047
"The team has has listed the 2 files that they propose to change namely - the view- app/views/response/response.html.erb and the partial app/views/submitted_content/_self_review.html.erb. However, they could have described what these files currently do and their purpose in the documentation. The authors have embedded screenshots of how the UI of the review page will look after the Analyze button will be included. They have specified that a pop up showing the suggestion metrics pertaining to a review namely - volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics will be generated once the button is clicked.",1215867,1,8047
changes are explained well. suggestion detection algorithm an be explained a bit more or how exactly you will be using it. probably some code snippets would help explaining that.,1216729,0,8047
The current explanation talks only about changes in the view. It would be better if the solution is explained at greater depth.,1216864,1,8047
The authors have not specified any code changes as of now so I can't comment on it. Suggestion: You might want to add any API Adapter class you plan to implement to generalize the solution for any future API implementations.  ,1216854,1,8047
Well done on adding almost everything. ,1216400,-1,8024

"Design document has all the necessary information like project design, test plan. The team has gone through their topic deeply and can be seen by their illustration of their implementation. Also, they have included code snippets which show thoroughness of their approach ",1217024,-1,8090
"The design doc contains project purpose, project design and testing plan in the wiki. The wiki contains mock visualizations which make it easy to understand the project proposal and how are they planning to do. The design flow as a flow chart adds to the ease of understanding. The test plan explains about the technologies that they are planning to use for testing. Suggestion:  The test plan could say what should be done in testing than just the technologies to be used for a particular part of code. For ed, we plan to have a dummy small data and see if the graphs output the visualizations correctly, if the sum id being counted to 100% of the class participation etc... the stacked version could also have been represented for better understanding.",1215190,-1,8090
"The document shows the flow of work really well.However, I would like to suggest to put more of test planning and the tools and technologies that will be used. This will enhance the quality of the document to a great extent.",1215325,-1,8090
"The design doc is good and provides a clear picture about the objective of the project. However,It would also be nice to know what features would be tested in the test plan.",1214768,-1,8090
All necessary sections are present.,1216687,-1,8090
The design document contains the project purpose and the changes proposed by the team. The design flow gives an overview of the bar graphs that the team plan to generate for selected criterias. The introduction section however should largely focus on the project description. ,1214753,1,8090
"The documentation covered almost everything from project purpose, design flow as well as some info on what files will be changed in the project.  Suggestion: I feel that the test plan was a bit vague. Some more details should have been provided. For example- What all features will be tested. Or maybe some info about edge cases and different scenarios that will be covered. ",1214881,1,8090
"The write-up is well written but is missing a few things - the original problem description, how will the changes being proposed will be implemented etc.",1215220,1,8090
Yes the design incorporates all of the functionalities,1215980,-1,8090
Incorporates intended functionality.,1215699,-1,8090
"Yes, their design has all of the functionality that are required.",1217000,-1,8090
The design document has included all the functionality that is required by the project description.,1216471,-1,8090
Yes,1217025,-1,8090
"The design incorporates and clearly explains flow of diagram for class performance, but not much is included for Integration of review performance. suggestion : The topic of Integration of review performance can be talked about in brief .",1215191,1,8090
"The writeup shows very little since the work has not yet been started. Therefore it does not clearly incorporates what all functionalities will be required. However, there are some mentioned in proposed changes area.",1215326,1,8090
The design has a good design flow diagram which is clear and concise.,1214769,-1,8090
Yes the design incorporated all functionality required. But more explanation is needed around which graph they intend to show.,1216688,1,8090
The design follows the basic functionality expected by proposing a bar graph solution for the select criteria. It could incorporate the rubrics that the team are planning to target. The flow in general does help to understand the project.,1214754,-1,8090
The design document incorporated all the functionalities that the project is supposed to be implementing.  No suggestions. ,1214882,-1,8090
Yes,1215221,-1,8090
"The explanation is quite well documented such as including the flow chart , kind of bar graphs they would prefer and the files that they will update. Adding of screenshots of the flow of the website would make it more easy to understand for a leyman.",1215981,1,8090
Changes suggested look good.,1215700,-1,8090
"The overall quality of the explanations are good, but they should include more details about their design, which may not be easy to understand.",1217001,1,8090
the team has mentioned all the files that will be changed and have also written a paragraph stating what are the proposed changes. The team could also document the changes that are being made to individual code files stating the changes done using code snippets and the reason why the changes are being made. Also they can talk about what design patterns principle are being used to incorporate the functionality that is being proposed. The team could also use CRC cards to depict the proposed code changes. This will not only help readers understand the report better but also help the team in dividing work between the team members and fast tracking the completion of project.,1216472,-1,8090
"The team has well explained what are they going to change. Though I didn't get how are they going to do the proposed changes. Since they are going to introduce a new feature, they have focussed more on explaining how to use the new feature. ",1217026,1,8090
"The changes proposed for the Class performance is adequate and explains the files to be changed, what changes from the controller perspective and views perspective. no particular suggestions proposed",1215192,-1,8090
Right the project is in its initial phase. The overall changes proposed by the authors are now very unclear about how they are going to work.,1215327,1,8090
The team proposed to add a bar graph to give a pictorial view of the scores and indicate the performance of students.,1214770,-1,8090
"More explanation around only those two graphs are being considered is needed. While its early in the project, at least what changes will be made to a file could have been mentioned.",1216689,-1,8090
proposed changes needs more explanation at the files and system specifically what files needs to be changed and how ,1216179,-1,8090
"The changes proposed by the team include implementing a bar chart, stacked or single. Based upon the project description, it is advised that the team look for other alternatives like pie chart that would help to span the results with a minimal look.       ",1214755,-1,8090
A simple enough explanation has been provided for the functionality.  No suggestions.,1214883,-1,8090
Could not find any explanations regarding the changes proposed.,1215222,1,8090
For Now the design proposed looks perfect.,1215982,-1,8090
Design flow looks good.,1215701,-1,8090
"Their designs are great, but some designs may be complicated.",1217002,1,8090
The authors seem to have studied the code well and have thought of a good plan to implement the project. They also seem to follow DRY principles while adding and changing code. Also the new design flow is quite simple and easy to understand which can be implemented without any high degree of convoluted code.,1216473,-1,8090
"The proposed solution sounds good. They haven't really mentioned the changes in turn of programmer language. I couldn't visualize how are they going to make changes. They have mentioned few html.erb file but I think they would need put a good amount of work to implement the new feature. I think the team could have been more precise in their approach, for example, they could have included what all new methods they need to add or modify the existing one.",1217027,1,8090
"The design changes as described are sound, they are mostly on Javascript for the visualization and dont potentially make the code ""smelly""",1215193,-1,8090
"So far whatever is discussed seems to go in the right direction.However, not much research is done so far. I would suggest them to quickly start researching about how they are going to work and how will the technologies they plan to use work.",1215328,1,8090
The author is clear with the intended output for the project but what actual changes are to be made is not yet clear as work on the project might not have started yet.,1214771,1,8090
"Since the graphs will be constructed dynamically for the entire class as whole, the impact on response time needs to be considered in case there are a large number of entries to process as this could involve database calls.",1216690,1,8090
The design looks good enough. It mostly deals with html.erb files to accommodate the graph and some database filtering in the controllers.I do not think that the design will increase the responses time of the system. Suggestion: If the details regarding how the graph will be implemented or any gem will be used should have been given. I did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality. That too would have been useful. ,1214884,-1,8090
"No plan provided, cannot comment.",1215223,1,8090
"The UML diagram included here is a flow chart diagram , which explains the process of how the instructor will be able to see the visualization and is easy to understand the flow",1215983,-1,8090
Design flow diagram is included indicating the flow which is good.,1215702,1,8090
"The UML diagrams is great, which is clear and easy to understand.",1217003,-1,8090
The have included a detailed design flow representation and have also included the visualizations. The could have added Lo-Fi UI cards to depict changes to views which will help them visualize the changes and also help instructors in suggesting improvements at an early stage which will help reduce unnecessary code changes in latter stages of the project.,1216474,1,8090
One flow chart and one chart graph are included. I find the chart incomplete and confusing too. I wasn't able to relate how this is going to help real scenario. The better way would be to use a use case diagram or take example of our current class programs.,1217028,1,8090
The team has attached a bar chart for visualization which helps in understanding their purpose. Suggestion : More visual aids could have been added. The stacked bar chart as mentioned earlier . More mockups could have been added.,1215194,1,8090
"There are no UML diagrams as such in the writeup.However, there is a flowchart which somewhat gives a clear view how they plan to do the things.",1215329,1,8090
The design diagram is good and it would also be helpful to have a few screenshots of the current expertiza view.,1214772,-1,8090
Diagram for stacked chart missing from the design document.,1216691,1,8090
NO UML diagram,1216181,1,8090
The team has provided a flow diagram that helps to infer the structural outline of the project. The scope of the project can be perceived from the diagram.,1214757,-1,8090
A flowchart and graph has been shown in the documentation.  Suggestions: I feel that there should have been mockups of the screens where the functionality will actually appear. Team should have shown how the solution would look like on the expertiza page. There could have been use case diagrams too. ,1214885,-1,8090
Two graphs provided provide a good understanding of the process and what expected visualization should be. More diagrams would have been helpful.,1215224,-1,8090
The design is likely to increase the response time since API requests take time. It is essential to implement a system that keeps track of these API responses and disables this functionality when the API is unresponsive beyond and unreasonable time.,1214827,1,8047
" Design appears to be sound, however, it is unclear where the NLP algorithm is supposed to go. As in, will the 1st iteration use another service to analyze with the button, and then a 2nd iteration will add the local NLP algorithm?",1216790,1,8047
I don't think the authors plan to add methods to a wrong class. They seem to be working on the right class namely Review and its associated view page review.html.erb that exactly pertains to their project. The response time might potentially increase with this new feature. But fortunately the team has proposed to work on optimizing the suggestion algorithm so that it does not take forever to execute. The team has done a good job on the design documentation.,1215868,1,8047
"I think the files that the authors plan to modify seems to be quite appropriate. As to the 'smell' of the code that can be ascertained only when they have started writing the code. So far though the design seems sound. There have however been no mention of the existence of any gems. I think the authors should explore that avenue as well as that would probably simplify their task. For example:- I found the gem sentimental that categorizes the phrases into positive, negative and neutral. I think this is something the authors can look into.",1216124,1,8047
More effort should be expended on the design.The current explanation talks only about changes in the view. It would be better if the solution is explained at greater depth.,1216865,1,8047
As the design document section is missing I cannot review the quality of their proposed design.,1216855,1,8047
Everything has been described well and in details.,1217004,1,8068
I do not think that the design will increase the response time of the system. Suggestion: I did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality. That would have been useful. The test plan does mention  ViewSuggestionMetricsForReviewSegment though. If this is the method name then it does not follow snake casing. ,1214949,1,8047
The document is well structured and provides all required information. ,1215285,0,8068
"The design doc is well written , but they haven't specified any test plans. They've explained the steps well, but haven't written anything about tests.",1216370,1,8068
The mockups do explain where the team intends to add the 'Analyze' button. It however makes no explanation of where the analysis will be shown.,1214828,1,8047
"There is no mention of testing, also code change related details have not been included. Otherwise the document is very good.",1216520,1,8068
UML diagrams are not included,1216035,1,8047
UML diagrams are not provided. Please add it.,1215629,1,8047
"test plan is specified, but UML is missing. They have added the ER diagram though, which i don't think is required here.",1216712,1,8068
"The team has included 2 screenshots of the review UI. The first one depicts the existing look and the 2nd one shows that they plan to include a new button that is responsible for analyzing the segmented text corresponding to each rubric where the student has reviewed and also display a pop-up message showing the results of suggestion metrics like volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics.  The team has also shown the user story in Connextra format and also described to scenarios- one happy path and one where no text is typed into the segmented text box input.  The team could have made the document even more visually palatable with flow chars / UML diagrams for Use case or Sequence diagram to support the feature and the scenarios they plan to implement.",1215869,1,8047
"The document clearly states what is missing and how they are planning to implement that thing , they state how many new criterion are they going to add to the search feature, However, I would suggest them to include how will they implement it. There is no explanation of how things will be done.",1215350,1,8068
"The team has used screenshots to explain their plan, but haven't used any diagrams, like UML, or flowchart to describe their flow.",1216434,1,8047
The design document gives a clear picture of the intended functionality of the project but it should have included test cases or what would be tested.,1215758,-1,8068
The authors have provided a mock-up of their final design which seems pretty good. However what's missing is UML diagrams. Something that would help understand the flow of functionality would be useful.,1216125,1,8047
The design document describes the problem statement and the expected flow. But the approach section doesn't have any technical implementation details. It just explains the flow that is going to be implemented. Test plan is missing.,1216425,1,8068
"Project purpose and the proposed solution is defined in the documentation. However, the test plan is not stated in the documentation.",1215067,1,8068
It would be better to add more diagrams.,1216866,1,8047
"The authors have provided a mock up screen of the proposed solution. which clarifies how their solution will look like. However, the use of visual aids seems to be inadequate since, they have not added any class diagram, use-case or sequence diagram to elaborate their solution in depth. Suggestion: You might want to add a diagram for your proposed design pattern as suggested above to improvise your write-up",1216856,1,8047
"The project purpose and possible solutions are clearly described in this design doc. However, the author only talked about the solution but no exactly what they need to do to implement the solutions. Also, there is no testing plan.",1214986,1,8068
The team has done a good job trying to show with pictures what their changes will look like in the front- end. No UML has been provided.,1217157,1,8047
Yes everything is incorporated.,1217005,-1,8068
Wireframes have been given stating what the end product will look like. But I did not find any UML diagrams or tables.  Suggestion: The team could have mentioned use case diagrams or a flow chart explaining the flow of the functionality.,1214950,1,8047
Yes.,1215286,-1,8068
"Yes, they've included all functionalities.",1216371,-1,8068
The design document covers all the possible cases and should be fine.,1216521,-1,8068
The writeup does not talk about the functionalities . However they include what is missing and what they will include.,1215351,1,8068
The design incorporates all the basic functionality.,1215759,0,8068
The quality of explanation is good and adequate.,1217006,-1,8068
search questionnaire and search reviews don't have detailed explanation of what should be done.,1216482,1,8068
"The explanations seem very clear. Although, splitting the ER diagram into 1 or 2 more sections would have made the design simple to understand in my opinion.",1215287,1,8068
"The explanation of changes is good enough that it states what all needs to be added/re-implemented, but it does not elaborate on some technical aspects.",1216372,1,8068
it could be better if you tell in which files you'll be making those changes and if you'll create new functions or make change in existing functions.,1216714,1,8068
"The authors have proposed changes that they are planning to implement. However, they have not included how they will go on to implement these changes. ",1215352,1,8068
The changes proposed are good and clearly meet the objectives of the project.,1215760,-1,8068
need more detail of design to show any future suggestion ,1216483,1,8068
"Code snippets are not mentioned, but design is properly done.",1215288,1,8068
"Overall, the design proposed seems good.",1216373,-1,8068
can't say in what file they'll make change as its not specified in the document. You can add what changes you'll be making and explain a little more for better understanding.,1216715,1,8068
"The authors do not talk much about the technical aspects of how they are going to implement their work. The new design they proposed however seem to go on the right track. However, not much research is done till now.",1215353,-1,8068
"Did not see much info on the files or classes the changes proposed, so its hard to comment here",1215855,1,8068
Code level details are not covered in this doc. But the high-level approach looks fine to me.,1216428,1,8068
"The authors need to provide more detailed procedures about how they going to implement their solutions, instead of the results after they done it.",1214989,1,8068
"The diagram show relationships between different models involve in the project, helped to give a clear vision of what should be implement. But no implementation design is visible. ",1216484,1,8068
uml is missing but er diagram is given. you can add a uml diagram it explains things better. ,1216716,1,8068
Not required for this project,1214798,0,8068
"They have depicted their working strategy through an ER diagram. However, I would suggest them to include more UML diagrams to enhance understandability. Also, the ER diagram is somewhat incomplete.",1215354,1,8068
"I feel the diagram is more complex, team could have gone with some usecase/UML/CRC diagrams",1215856,1,8068
Just one ER diagram. Add use case and activity/flow diagrams.,1216429,-1,8068
"The authors have visually represented the system by depicting the method through an ER diagram. However, the diagram is a little high level and does not completely explain the flow of the system.",1215071,1,8068
"There is an ER diagram helps the reviewer understand the relationship between different sets. Maybe more screenshot can be provided to show where is the search bar, etc.",1214990,-1,8068
The team have done a good job explaining their project. But I feel the team should have detailed their explanation of the implementation more. Also more test cases should have been included in more detail.,1214763,1,8061
"The design document was clear and concise; however, I would like to see more details on how routes.rb and the views will be edited to pull static strings from the en.yml file. The test plan section is not detailed enough.",1215860,1,8061
The entire project flow is well documented along with the basic structural requirements. The document aligns with the plan of action and showcases the exact purpose of the project.,1215145,-1,8061
The project design doc is complete and specifies both issues and prospective solutions.,1216248,-1,8061
The doc mentions the changes to be made in a detailed way along with a proper stepwise explanation of the solution or the approach to be taken plus the screenshots which help in better understanding.,1215215,-1,8061
"All parts are presented, but need little fore explanation in test plan part. ",1216590,1,8061
Good work. Good documentation,1216595,-1,8061
Although it looks like a good start the team can still improve on the design by adding a UML diagram and a test plan. There is a need for a low-level design explanation so that others can understand the technical details of the implementation.,1216772,1,8082
No clarification,1215315,1,8082
"Both the project purpose and the project design are not very well stated.  In terms of project purpose, although I was expecting it to appear in the introduction part, it actually did not. The part just stated a high-level abstract goal, being transmitting the conflicting message to the grader. But it's not at all stated in detail. So I went to the proposed solution to find the project purpose. In the proposed solution section, Neither project purpose nor project design was well put. It talks about changes that are expected to be implemented in the file. But they are not talked about in detail. This sentence: ""loop through each review not for calculating the average but to compare the new review score with each review score""    seems to be not so easy to be understood. The project design seems also to be in the proposed solution section. There's no detailed modification plan, workflow statement, or anything.  The testing plan looks succinct and helpful enough for a tester to use and check the functionality. ",1214951,1,8082
No detaiiled design on how to do proposed solution no visuals ,1214844,1,8082
"Could be more specific, especially with test plan.",1216167,1,8082
"The project purpose is well defined and clearly explains what this project aims to do. The team also identifies the strategies they wish to adopt to fix the issue. This explanation is clear and concise. However, I would also suggest the team to add a basic test plan, on how they would test the functionality they add. Also I suggest them to list down the list of files they would be changing.",1215807,1,8082
The document seems complete.,1216036,-1,8082
"The purpose, design are missing in their doc, so it not good.",1217014,1,8082
"Yes, they include project purpose, project design, and testing plan. It's a little short. It's suggested that add more details.  ",1216777,-1,8082
Could have been explained more,1215385,-1,8082
The team has included all the topics required for the documentation.,1215310,-1,8082
"The authors have included all the necessary sections of the design document. However, the document seems to be a very high-level explanation of the problem statement and proposed solutions. Suggestion: You can try elaborating more on the problem statement and the current scenario of the project. e.g. Try explaining what is the threshold for sending an email notification to the users.",1214996,1,8082
"Need improvements, can add design by adding UML diagrams and Test Plans.  Technical details with class diagram to explain the code level implementation would have been better.",1216782,1,8082
The design covers the functionalities but there seem to be no concrete solutions for the same. Some more explanations is expected.,1216773,1,8082
Not explained properly,1215316,1,8082
"The requirement here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Br9hm-SWIvl5ibWSfRVjmiYTQl5j27l8slWhv2iUCqQ/edit#heading=h.654oe3xw5p73  totally appeared in the design document. This is very good because there's a high-level goal being stated. However, the ""important files"" part which includes the Open github issue, delayed mailer, response controller and response model, only model is mentioned and the other four are not mentioned at all. It should be great if all of these can be mentioned.",1214952,1,8082
"Yes, in my opinion the team has understood the topic well and clearly listed all the functionality as described in the design document. Good Job !!",1215808,-1,8082
"No, many functionality are missing in their design.",1217015,1,8082
"Yes, they include all the functionality in the wiki page. They can work it better if they add more details and some visual aids.",1216778,-1,8082
Not descriptive,1215386,1,8082
"The authors have provided a brief design approach of storing the URL and looping it into an email notification, so that instructor would be able to identify which review has been mapped to it. Improvisation: You can try adding information about new functions you wish to add, and if yes, which of the files identified by the mentor do you want to add the function to. This will increase the depth of your design document.",1214997,1,8082
"The design is rather straightforward, incorporates all the functionality required.",1216456,-1,8082
Have explained the project as according to the given description.,1216783,-1,8082
Just few high-level details (very generic) are provided which makes it hard to visualize a solution,1216774,1,8082
No changes,1215317,1,8082
"The changes being proposed is not comprehensive. The changes in the controller is not mentioned at all. The current issue and end picture are also very hard to follow. I have the following questions: 1. How will the UI look like when the conflict- mentioning implementation is resolved? Or only email notification and no changes in the UI? 2. I cannot understand clearly the meaning of this sentence: ""loop through each review not for calculating the average but to compare the new review score with each review score"".",1214953,1,8082
"The authors propose changes in an extremely concise manner. The idea that the team proposes to follow seems logical, but I would suggest them to include a dummy example or sample pseudocode so that the english explanantion is backed up with an idea of the code as well. Such as this-: 1) Review X is submitted 2) Loop through Review 1......n If abs(Review n score - Review X score) >= (some value) store Review n URL in list  ",1215809,-1,8082
Their explanations are not detailed and sometimes it's not easy to understand.,1217016,1,8082
They did explain what they want to do. It's easy to understand and seems reasonable. They can make it more explicit and clear by making it step by step.,1216779,-1,8082
Not much described to rate over,1215387,-1,8082
The authors have explained the changes in a brief manner which are easy to understand,1215312,-1,8082
"It looks to me from the document that the authors are clear about their implementation. Suggestion: They can elaborate more by specifying how do they intend to store the URLs to the reviews, how are they identifying the two distinctly different reviews. They can also add a basic flow of their proposed solution. This will enhance the explanation.",1214998,-1,8082
"The explanations are brief and to the point, thought that seems to be due to the nature of the problem statement itself.",1216457,-1,8082
Solution and class level details are missing.,1216784,1,8082
The design is specified to a certain extent but does not provide where the changes will take place or what classes or tables will be affected.,1216775,1,8082
No plan introduced,1215318,1,8082
"5) more effort should be expended on the design. I think there are a lot of problems in the design. The changes to the controller, where the notification is implemented, such questions are not addressed. Also, the questions listed in the above answers are not addressed.",1214954,1,8082
"The authors propose a sound logic to improve the functionality required. However, I would suggest the team to think about looping over each and every review. This may increase the response time of the system. Perhaps more interaction with the instructors could help the team come up with a less complex solution.",1215810,-1,8082
"Frankly, I can not see their concrete designs from their doc. ",1217017,1,8082
The design appears to be complete.,1216780,-1,8082
Needs to work a bit on the plan,1215388,-1,8082
"The explanation is descriptive and explains the logic behind the solution which is think should work. However, I believe that team should can add the explanation about the files and classes they tend to make changes in. The team can now focus on implementation of the code.",1215313,-1,8082
"The new design does not talk about any methods or class definitions, thus I cannot comment on this. Suggestion: You can add more information on methods or any usage of design patterns in order to make the review effective and useful.",1214999,1,8082
"The new design loops through all existing reviews to compare new review scores with the original ones, and stores the URL of a specific iteration if its limit is exceeded. By waiting for all reviews to be looped in before sending email, it may increase the response time of the system.",1216458,1,8082
The design explains much of the detail about the problem but classes which will be affected or needs changes are not provided.,1216785,1,8082
No UML Diagram is provided so can't comment.,1216776,1,8082
No UML diagrams,1215319,1,8082
There's no diagrams or any other visual aids available. I would suggest adding at least some workflow diagram.,1214955,1,8082
"The team has not provided any visual representation of the work they propose to do. Perhaps the pseudocode mentioned above, could instead be shown as a set of diagrams showing an example for how this fucntionality would be handled when one say 1 Review has a score disparity of more than the threshold for existing 2-3 reviews. The idea here is not to add working screenshots, but a Low-Fi diagram would also help in making the documentation visually more representative.",1215811,1,8082
Some screenshots of actual emails sent and proposed format of the new email would be helpful,1216040,-1,8082
They did not write or add proper visual aids to help readers to understand.,1217018,1,8082
This design is good. There are no visual aids. Maybe they can consider use it to make it more detailed.,1216781,1,8082
No diagrams to refer to,1215389,1,8082
Unfortunately the visual aids are missing.,1215314,1,8082
Visual aids are absent from the write-up. Suggestions: Use cases for email notification can be added. Template/design of the new/modified email can be added.  Any relevant design pattern diagram can be added.,1215000,1,8082
"No visual aids, UML diagrams, or table/screen mockups were provided.",1216459,1,8082
NO UML diagram is provided so cant comment.,1216786,1,8082
"The team has well explained the problem statement along with the application flow which makes it easier to understand about the project. They has also described the method which discusses their proposed implementation. However, it would be helpful to add more details on the design approach they have chosen. The team has also proposed a short test plan on a very high level, which makes senses as this is very early level of the project, but its suggested to add more diverse test cases to it as it would help in handling all the cases during the development of functionality of  self review extension.",1215663,1,8109
The team have done a good job explaining their problem statement and implementation. But the documentation does not include the testing plan. The team should write about the tests they plan to implement.,1216842,1,8018
The design data includes most of the important information required to understand the teams plan.,1214824,-1,8046
The doc seems complete. All aspects of the problem statement are covered and test plan is also included. A UML diagram may prove to be useful.,1216031,-1,8046
" This seems complete to me. They have the introduction with a purpose and problem, a ui mockup, and use cases. It does seem odd that the use cases are listed in the test plan.",1216787,1,8046
Good job on UI and test cases. Kindly add UML diagram.,1215625,-1,8046
"The project documentation looks complete with clear details about the purpose- to enable the students to better analyze their review based on the suggestion metrics (like volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics). They have delineated the design that includes the files that the team proposes to change (the view- app/views/response/response.html.erb and the partial app/views/submitted_content/_self_review.html.erb), the screenshot of the existing UI of the review section and how the UI would look after the project with the inclusion of a button to analyze and they have specified that a popup displaying the suggestion metrics will emerge when the button is clicked.  I specifically like how the Test plan includes their feature in the Connextra format. They have mentioned 2 scenarios- one where the student clicks the button without entering text in which case the popup alerts the reviewer saying no text for analysis and the regular scenario when the user clicks the analyze button after entering text in which case the popup displays the suggestion metrics. I wish to suggest an additional scenario where the user can intuitively test the quality of the suggestion metrics, based on the review input. Like for example, there can be test cases which show that the suggestion algorithm detects generic reviews that might be seemingly relevant to the topic but add no customization to the project being reviewed (like how some reviewers menially copy paste the same format of the review to all projects with just minor changes). Overall the team has done a great job with the documentation and I look forward to see the implementation of this project in the upcoming review.  ",1215865,-1,8046
"The design document contains some extra information, such as a whole paragraph about expertiza, which I think can be skipped and more importance should be put on the design part.",1216430,1,8046
"looks great. test plan , screenshots are all given. uml is missing but i don't think its required as the changes are in html.",1216727,-1,8046
The purpose of the project is very clear and well outlined. The project design seems to be barely mentioned. There have been mentions of the word 'API' but not which one. So reading the doc I have no clue of how they are going to implement this. However I do know the files that they are going to modify. The test plan has been written in the form of cucumber user stories. I am not entirely sure if it is the correct approach.,1216121,1,8046
The design doc is complete and clearly indicates the project objectives. The test plan indicates what aspects are to be tested and screenshots of the proposed analyze button are also posted.,1215718,-1,8046
Project purpose and testing plan are nicely explained in the design doc. It would be better if the project design is more elaborateive.,1216862,1,8046
"The document specifies the problem statement and the ""analyze"" functionality they want to incorporate. However, the design document seems to be incomplete as they have not talked about the exact identified functionality i.e ""analyze"" and the design document section is empty. Suggestion : You can talk about methods you want to add or existing methods you want to modify and how. I think that you can remove the expertiza introduction section as mentioned by the professor.    ",1216852,1,8046
The document is complete and very clear.,1217153,-1,8046
The design document gives details about the problem statement and gives an idea about what is to be done in the project. It specifies what files will be modified and the test plan also contains 2 scenarios mentioned. No suggestions.  ,1214946,-1,8046
The design document mentions nothing about evaluation of how long the API takes to return with a JSON.,1214825,1,8046
"Yes, I think the document includes everything as expected.",1216032,-1,8046
" Yes, the wiki appears to incorporate all of the required functionality. We want students to know if they're giving helpful feedback, and we want the NLP algorithm to be local to the Expertiza project to decrease its reaction time. They have at least shown that they are going to add buttons. ",1216788,-1,8046
Few information is missing like specification on NLP and how exactly the implementation would be. Idea is fine but add more details to it.,1215626,1,8046
I could not spot the problem statement of the proposed project in the Google doc containing the list of Problem statements. But on reading the team's design documentation on the wiki page I'm quite satisfied with the functionality that they plan to include. In addition to elucidating the main functional requirement of the project namely- the implementation of the suggestion algorithm the team has also proposed a non-functional requirement of improving the performance and response time of the time it takes to generate the suggestion through the web service.,1215866,-1,8046
"Yes, the design document incorporates the plan to implement the functionalities as stated in the problem statement.",1216431,-1,8046
yes all changes are incorporated and explained well.,1216728,-1,8046
As mentioned before the document is good for most of the part except that key aspects of the implementation are missing which leaves me wondering about how exactly they are going to do this. I would like more details on this so called 'API',1216122,1,8046
The design incorporates most of the functionality required. It would be nice to have a design diagram.,1215719,-1,8046
The design incorporates most of the functionality but it would be better if the actual design is discussed more clearly.,1216863,1,8046
"The authors have provided a high level solution to the problem statement.  They have mentioned that they are going to use an API for suggestion detection, but have not yet identified one. Suggestion: You can survey on the existing APIs and discuss about at least two of them in depth and specify which one you feel is more compatible with expertiza. This will improve your write-up significantly.",1216853,1,8046
"Yes, they have discussed about all the functionality",1217154,-1,8046
Yes. ,1216208,-1,8046
The design document incorporated all the functionalities that the project is supposed to be implementing.  No suggestions. ,1214947,-1,8046
The explanation of how the received data will be stored/presented is something I would suggest the team to add. The design document also misses out on where the data will be presented in the view.,1214826,1,8046
I am able to understand the purpose of the project.,1216033,-1,8046
 Add a button to these questions to analyze them for their helpfulness. Seems clear to me.,1216789,-1,8046
Please add more information on the NLP algorithm team is trying to use.,1215627,-1,8046
"The team has has listed the 2 files that they propose to change namely - the view- app/views/response/response.html.erb and the partial app/views/submitted_content/_self_review.html.erb. However, they could have described what these files currently do and their purpose in the documentation. The authors have embedded screenshots of how the UI of the review page will look after the Analyze button will be included. They have specified that a pop up showing the suggestion metrics pertaining to a review namely - volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics will be generated once the button is clicked.",1215867,1,8046
"The explanation is pretty good, I particularly found the images explaining what all they are going to add pretty intuitive.",1216432,-1,8046
changes are explained well. suggestion detection algorithm an be explained a bit more or how exactly you will be using it. probably some code snippets would help explaining that.,1216729,-1,8046
"The authors have mentioned including 'Analyze' buttons for sentiment analysis of different parts of the comments. I think the rationale for this is very good because if they were to send all of the comments at once as input to the API, the results would be a mix of the sentiments of all the different comments and would therefore not be accurate. Also this way, I think that the response time of the system would not be affected by a whole lot.",1216123,-1,8046
The explanation is good and clearly indicates the project objectives.,1215720,-1,8046
The current explanation talks only about changes in the view. It would be better if the solution is explained at greater depth.,1216864,1,8046
The authors have not specified any code changes as of now so I can't comment on it. Suggestion: You might want to add any API Adapter class you plan to implement to generalize the solution for any future API implementations.  ,1216854,-1,8046
The explanations are lucid.,1217155,-1,8046
More explanation on how to proceed with the implementation could have been added. Could have also added technologies to be used.,1216209,1,8046
"A simple enough explanation has been provided for how the functionality will be working.  Suggestion: I feel that the approach that the team will take to implement the functionality should have been explained more elaborately. For example what different possible methods will be implemented. Or how the web service will be used, or what kind of data the web service will provide for suggestion detection. ",1214948,1,8046
The design is likely to increase the response time since API requests take time. It is essential to implement a system that keeps track of these API responses and disables this functionality when the API is unresponsive beyond and unreasonable time.,1214827,-1,8046
" Design appears to be sound, however, it is unclear where the NLP algorithm is supposed to go. As in, will the 1st iteration use another service to analyze with the button, and then a 2nd iteration will add the local NLP algorithm?",1216790,1,8046
The design seems to be following DRY principle. ,1215628,-1,8046
I don't think the authors plan to add methods to a wrong class. They seem to be working on the right class namely Review and its associated view page review.html.erb that exactly pertains to their project. The response time might potentially increase with this new feature. But fortunately the team has proposed to work on optimizing the suggestion algorithm so that it does not take forever to execute. The team has done a good job on the design documentation.,1215868,0,8046
"The design appears to be sound, and wouldn't conflict with the existing classes or methods. ",1216433,-1,8046
"2 html files require change, i don't think it will affect anything.",1216730,-1,8046
"I think the files that the authors plan to modify seems to be quite appropriate. As to the 'smell' of the code that can be ascertained only when they have started writing the code. So far though the design seems sound. There have however been no mention of the existence of any gems. I think the authors should explore that avenue as well as that would probably simplify their task. For example:- I found the gem sentimental that categorizes the phrases into positive, negative and neutral. I think this is something the authors can look into.",1216124,1,8046
"No design has been yet proposed by the author, however i feel the author is on track to make the right changes by looking at the files intended to be modified.",1215721,-1,8046
More effort should be expended on the design.The current explanation talks only about changes in the view. It would be better if the solution is explained at greater depth.,1216865,1,8046
As the design document section is missing I cannot review the quality of their proposed design.,1216855,1,8046
Not much has been talked about the methods to be added. but the files specified seems right,1217156,-1,8046
I do not think that the design will increase the response time of the system. Suggestion: I did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality. That would have been useful. The test plan does mention  ViewSuggestionMetricsForReviewSegment though. If this is the method name then it does not follow snake casing. ,1214949,-1,8046
The mockups do explain where the team intends to add the 'Analyze' button. It however makes no explanation of where the analysis will be shown.,1214828,1,8046
UML diagrams are not included,1216035,1,8046
UML diagrams are not provided. Please add it.,1215629,1,8046
"The team has included 2 screenshots of the review UI. The first one depicts the existing look and the 2nd one shows that they plan to include a new button that is responsible for analyzing the segmented text corresponding to each rubric where the student has reviewed and also display a pop-up message showing the results of suggestion metrics like volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics.  The team has also shown the user story in Connextra format and also described to scenarios- one happy path and one where no text is typed into the segmented text box input.  The team could have made the document even more visually palatable with flow chars / UML diagrams for Use case or Sequence diagram to support the feature and the scenarios they plan to implement.",1215869,1,8046
"The team has used screenshots to explain their plan, but haven't used any diagrams, like UML, or flowchart to describe their flow.",1216434,1,8046
"screenshots are added, which are enough to tell what they will be doing in the front end. a bit more can be explained on backend part by giving code snippets.",1216731,1,8046
The authors have provided a mock-up of their final design which seems pretty good. However what's missing is UML diagrams. Something that would help understand the flow of functionality would be useful.,1216125,-1,8046
The screenshots posted give a clear picture of the intended output. It would be nice to have a design diagram.,1215722,-1,8046
It would be better to add more diagrams.,1216866,-1,8046
"The authors have provided a mock up screen of the proposed solution. which clarifies how their solution will look like. However, the use of visual aids seems to be inadequate since, they have not added any class diagram, use-case or sequence diagram to elaborate their solution in depth. Suggestion: You might want to add a diagram for your proposed design pattern as suggested above to improvise your write-up",1216856,1,8046
The team has done a good job trying to show with pictures what their changes will look like in the front- end. No UML has been provided.,1217157,1,8046
Adequate diagrams are given. Explanation of problem statement done well.,1216211,-1,8046
Wireframes have been given stating what the end product will look like. But I did not find any UML diagrams or tables.  Suggestion: The team could have mentioned use case diagrams or a flow chart explaining the flow of the functionality.,1214950,1,8046
"The team has done a good job in explaining the project and its purpose with the design and files that need to be changed. However,  Test plan is provided.",1216807,1,8100
The issue and the it's implementation has not been explained that well especially the project design and testting,1217009,1,8100
Test plan is blank... The diagrams are good but a little more writing on what you are planning to do would have been nice,1215842,1,8100
Team needs to work upon adding more content in the document. Project design needs to be explained more with text and bullets. Team should add Test Plan.,1214966,1,8100
Can elaborate more on the problem statement and the approach that you are planning to take,1215180,1,8100
"Here, the most important thing, the problem statement is missing. Secondly, no test plan has been mentioned. So, this makes the document incomplete.",1216495,1,8100
Testing plan is empty.,1215130,1,8100
Test plan missing. Links section empty(placeholder could have been provided or don't mention it at all). No design proposed.,1216672,1,8100
the project describes the project requirement in detail. the project statement is clear. the team has also included the design/flow which they will be following in order to achieve the desired results. the testing strategy is currently missing from the wiki. the team should inlclude the test plan in the documentation.,1215502,1,8100
"Detailed design and test plan lacks. For introduction part, the explanation is not clear enough and a little bit confusing. It is better to add more explantation about what the project is and point out the exact purpose clearly.",1215365,1,8100
Explained the project and its purpose with the design and files that need to be changed.  Test plan section is created but no description or plan is given.,1216762,1,8100
It gives purpose and design but no test plan.,1215155,1,8100
The design has pretty much covered all the functionalities in the doc.,1216808,-1,8100
Hard to tell as very little explanation given.,1217010,-1,8100
"Yes,  Design incorporates almost all the functionalities that should be tackled as per problem statement. ",1214967,-1,8100
"Yes, they are trying to incorporate all the requirements",1215181,-1,8100
Yes it incorporates all of the functionality required,1216158,-1,8100
"Well, a small paragraph on implementation has been given, but that does not quite serve the purpose. Though, there are UML diagrams which explain the flow.",1216496,1,8100
Yes.,1215131,-1,8100
No design provided. Use case diagrams have the functionality explained.,1216673,-1,8100
the team did a great work in understanding the requirements and have included the design for all the requirement mentioned in the requirement document.,1215503,-1,8100
"The deign gives some use cases for this project, but compared to all the functionality required for this project, it is not enough. More detailed description about the design of other things need to be added, such as model, view.",1215366,1,8100
The design has pretty much covered all the requested functionality. ,1216763,-1,8100
The quality is of explanation is good and easy to follow. The team might want to add some low-level details for the code changes.,1216809,1,8100
The solutions and implementations have very little explanation. Even though the UML are helpful they should provide more text,1217011,1,8100
These explanations feel kinda minimalist,1215844,1,8100
Design plan of the document only explains algorithm or flow for the code change. Team should explain the changes from existing system  to proposed solution with some texts.,1214968,1,8100
You can explain more on what actually are you planning to change.,1215182,1,8100
"As mentioned above, the document lacks a lot of details. The proposed changes have not been mentioned.",1216497,1,8100
The chart is very clear.,1215132,-1,8100
No changes proposed.,1216674,1,8100
the team has explained the implementation design/strategy in detail. the design was explained with all the required details and was very easy to understand.  ,1215504,-1,8100
The team only provides use cases. These cases gave me a brief insight of the flow but more literally explantation may need.,1215367,1,8100
Have explained the problem and its functionality is described but missing proposal for code changes. ,1216764,1,8100
"1. The grammar in introduction may need improvement to be more understandable. 2. For abbreviations, it would be better to give explanations to help others understand.",1215157,1,8100
The design has explained the use cases with proper diagrams. Although more information is required to see any of the above-mentioned issues.,1216810,1,8100
The project design has not really been expanded upon so not able to tell,1217012,-1,8100
The reuse of the questionaire class is smart to reduce duplication. Otherwise the minimal explanations make it hard to judge,1215845,-1,8100
"1. Team technically understand the change and proposed solution does not lead to adding methods in wrong classes. 2. New design should not make the code smelly. 3. Changes are logical and proposed solution is reasonable enough. No gem required. 4. It should not increase response time. 5. No, the plan is nice and should be taken forward. ",1214969,-1,8100
Try to give a class diagram inorder to explain your implementation,1215183,-1,8100
"The flow has been explained through UML diagram. But, the proposed solution has not been given.",1216498,1,8100
No problem found.,1215133,-1,8100
No design proposed.,1216675,1,8100
The changes are not yet suggested in the documentation. Only the files that will be changed are mentioned.,1215505,1,8100
Not detailed design was provided. These information was not included.,1215368,1,8100
The design has explained the use cases with proper diagrams but design to implement them is not absent.,1216765,1,8100
A use case diagram is provided in the documentation. The team should add a class diagram as well to give an idea of the low-level implementation.  ,1216811,1,8100
Yes the UML diagram have been correctly implemented and help in understanding their approach,1217013,-1,8100
The diagrams are very very large on the webpage. Consider making them half the size.,1215846,1,8100
"Yes, gives clear understanding using the use case diagram",1215184,-1,8100
"Team has majorly include diagrams for the code change and algorithm flows. Team should add UML diagrams to explain flow of the application change, sequence of actions, actors involved. ",1214970,1,8100
"UML diagrams are drawn well to explain the flow. So, the diagrams help in explaining the project flow.",1216499,-1,8100
Visual aids are great.,1215134,-1,8100
Use case diagrams explain the requirements properly but no system design related diagram or mock ups are given.,1216676,1,8100
The team did a great work in explaining the requirement with the help of flow chart which helped in better understanding of the requirements and proposed design.,1215506,-1,8100
The diagrams are clear enough to help me understand the flow of the project. ,1215369,-1,8100
"Diagrams for use cases are given properly, but the class diagram is missing.",1216766,1,8100
The flow charts are good and help a lot in understanding the work. Again. it would be better to explain the abbreviations.,1215159,1,8100
Everything has been described well and in details.,1217004,-1,8094
"at current state, the design doc has project problem, project solution, and design diagram, and each section has detailed description of the project. ",1216480,-1,8094
The document is well structured and provides all required information. ,1215285,-1,8094
"The design doc is well written , but they haven't specified any test plans. They've explained the steps well, but haven't written anything about tests.",1216370,1,8094
"There is no mention of testing, also code change related details have not been included. Otherwise the document is very good.",1216520,1,8094
"test plan is specified, but UML is missing. They have added the ER diagram though, which i don't think is required here.",1216712,1,8094
The document explains what was asked for,1215375,-1,8094
"The document clearly states what is missing and how they are planning to implement that thing , they state how many new criterion are they going to add to the search feature, However, I would suggest them to include how will they implement it. There is no explanation of how things will be done.",1215350,1,8094
The design document gives a clear picture of the intended functionality of the project but it should have included test cases or what would be tested.,1215758,1,8094
The design document describes the problem statement and the expected flow. But the approach section doesn't have any technical implementation details. It just explains the flow that is going to be implemented. Test plan is missing.,1216425,1,8094
"Project purpose and the proposed solution is defined in the documentation. However, the test plan is not stated in the documentation.",1215067,1,8094
"The project purpose and possible solutions are clearly described in this design doc. However, the author only talked about the solution but no exactly what they need to do to implement the solutions. Also, there is no testing plan.",1214986,1,8094
Yes everything is incorporated.,1217005,-1,8094
"All functions required are stated in the design document, which include search for user, assignment, questionnaire, and reviews. ",1216481,-1,8094
Yes.,1215286,-1,8094
"Yes, they've included all functionalities.",1216371,-1,8094
The design document covers all the possible cases and should be fine.,1216521,-1,8094
Yes it does. They have explained the propose solution as well for each issue.,1216713,-1,8094
"Yes, almost everything seems perfect, only a little more explaination is required",1215376,1,8094
The writeup does not talk about the functionalities . However they include what is missing and what they will include.,1215351,1,8094
The design incorporates all the basic functionality.,1215759,-1,8094
"Yes, almost all types of search functionalities are covered.",1216426,-1,8094
The design implements all the defined functionality elaborately.,1215068,-1,8094
"Yes, the design incorporates all of the functionality required and also gives the possible solutions.",1214987,-1,8094
The quality of explanation is good and adequate.,1217006,-1,8094
search questionnaire and search reviews don't have detailed explanation of what should be done.,1216482,1,8094
"The explanations seem very clear. Although, splitting the ER diagram into 1 or 2 more sections would have made the design simple to understand in my opinion.",1215287,1,8094
The proposed search features are good. If all of them are implemented it should more than suffice.,1216522,-1,8094
it could be better if you tell in which files you'll be making those changes and if you'll create new functions or make change in existing functions.,1216714,1,8094
"The authors have proposed changes that they are planning to implement. However, they have not included how they will go on to implement these changes. ",1215352,1,8094
The changes proposed are good and clearly meet the objectives of the project.,1215760,-1,8094
Team has given information on how it will work after the the project is done. Could have given more detail on Design using UML diagrams and Files invovled in the Project,1215854,1,8094
Good explanations. Easy to follow.,1216427,-1,8094
"The changes proposed by the authors are elaborate overall. They have defined the changes extensively. However, the ""Search for Reviews"" section could have elaborated more about the search functionality. The authors could have explained what could be searched and how the search functionality can be used a little more elaborately. ",1215069,1,8094
"The authors explain the project pretty well, they also provide a diagram to show the relationship between different sets. However, the solution can be more detailed and maybe cover some edge cases.",1214988,1,8094
need more detail of design to show any future suggestion ,1216483,1,8094
"Code snippets are not mentioned, but design is properly done.",1215288,1,8094
"Overall, the design proposed seems good.",1216373,-1,8094
They didn't add the code change details or the files in which they might work. That's still fine as those details can be filled once the implementation is done.,1216523,1,8094
can't say in what file they'll make change as its not specified in the document. You can add what changes you'll be making and explain a little more for better understanding.,1216715,1,8094
"Yes, the changes are completely feasible",1215378,-1,8094
"The authors do not talk much about the technical aspects of how they are going to implement their work. The new design they proposed however seem to go on the right track. However, not much research is done till now.",1215353,1,8094
"The author has not yet presented how the work is going to be done, as work on the project might not have started yet.",1215761,1,8094
"Did not see much info on the files or classes the changes proposed, so its hard to comment here",1215855,1,8094
Code level details are not covered in this doc. But the high-level approach looks fine to me.,1216428,1,8094
The authors have added the methods in the right classes. The new design is properly refactored and the gems are relevantly used. The new design might potentially increase the response time of the system because of advanced search option.,1215070,1,8094
"The authors need to provide more detailed procedures about how they going to implement their solutions, instead of the results after they done it.",1214989,1,8094
Yes they have provided an UML diagram which follows convention and explains their approach,1217008,-1,8094
"The diagram show relationships between different models involve in the project, helped to give a clear vision of what should be implement. But no implementation design is visible. ",1216484,1,8094
The team has added sufficient diagrams for the reader,1215289,-1,8094
The diagrams are succinct and well-understood.,1216374,-1,8094
"The ER Diagram is very well done. It encompasses all the classes and their attributes. Also the use of different shapes like diamond, square etc is great. ",1216524,-1,8094
uml is missing but er diagram is given. you can add a uml diagram it explains things better. ,1216716,1,8094
The E-R diagram seems to deliver the task,1215379,-1,8094
Not required for this project,1214798,-1,8094
"They have depicted their working strategy through an ER diagram. However, I would suggest them to include more UML diagrams to enhance understandability. Also, the ER diagram is somewhat incomplete.",1215354,1,8094
There is an ER diagram which defines the relationships in the system.,1215762,-1,8094
"I feel the diagram is more complex, team could have gone with some usecase/UML/CRC diagrams",1215856,1,8094
Just one ER diagram. Add use case and activity/flow diagrams.,1216429,1,8094
"The authors have visually represented the system by depicting the method through an ER diagram. However, the diagram is a little high level and does not completely explain the flow of the system.",1215071,1,8094
"There is an ER diagram helps the reviewer understand the relationship between different sets. Maybe more screenshot can be provided to show where is the search bar, etc.",1214990,1,8094
The problem statement is not clear,1215280,1,8109
The design related information is missing. The team has mentioned the problem statement and application flow. They need to add UML diagrams and in the first stage at least the proposed changes are expected.,1214849,1,8109
"The design documents looks very crisp and clear. The work flow, proposed solutions and test plans are all listed. Good work. A screenshot or two of the test cases would have made it even better.",1215410,1,8109
No everything is properly described.,1216565,-1,8109
The doc is very succinct and well written!  ,1216192,-1,8109
"The design document is good which covers every aspects from project purpose to the test cases . However, there are some things which I found incomplete. In the problem statement they should first of mention a proper definition  of what is meant by self review as the term is a bit ambiguous and in the flow diagram they have mentioned the flow which represents the UI aspect of the the project and not the flow of how the task would be implemented and thus the flow diagram must be changed ",1216011,1,8109
The doc is well written with all the necessary explanation. More detailed test plan would suffice the need of the document,1216757,1,8109
"I don't think anything is missing from their document, but it is in general ""lite"". I would prefer a few more details on how they plan to limit reviews from being viewed until a self-review is complete, or which places they plan on making changes. ",1214896,1,8109
"The problem statement is nicely explained with the help of flowchart. However some screenshot of the screens where changes need to be made as well a similar flow diagram for solution will be helpful. Test Plan is not stated in details. It just mentions Bullet Points.  In Test Driven Development, adequately defining the test cases is as important as developing a solution as per the problem statement. This should be corrected.",1217034,1,8109
There are no sections titled project design or project purpose.,1216610,1,8109
The project is complete and sound enough in its approach and the implementations and the test plan has been well devised and just shy of application.,1215405,-1,8109
"All the required part is in their design. However, maybe you can add a little more detail to your test plan. ",1216812,1,8109
The design incorporates all of the functionality required. ,1216813,-1,8109
"No, not all, but major of all functionalities.",1216566,1,8109
"Yes, their sections Method to calculate Composite Score and Application Flow sections have a flow chart as well as at least a targeted section of the code which they have planned to work upon. ",1215406,-1,8109
Yes it incorporates all the required functionalities along with the test cases,1216012,-1,8109
"Yes, the required functionality is covered with details in the document.",1216758,-1,8109
"Yes, I believe they have included all of the required functionality. ",1214897,-1,8109
Yes all the requirements mentioned in the Problem Statement are considered. Also the corresponding solutions are explained . A flow diagram or screenshots explaining the solution jsut like the problem statement is explained would have been helpful.,1217035,1,8109
The team has discussed the solution which is required for fixing the issue but has not proposed any design for their approach.,1215664,1,8109
"Yes, the functionalities are present. It would have been good if the issues were listed sequentially following its solutions.",1215411,1,8109
"In my opinion, they have included the application flow but where in Expertiza they are implementing this logic seems to be missing. They should include the same in round 2 when they have completed the implementation.",1214850,1,8109
The changes are clearly stated and represented. ,1216194,-1,8109
"I think you explained the change they want to make clear, but maybe you can state which file you want to make and how you guys want to change that file. ",1216814,1,8109
The team has suggested reasonable changes to address the problem statement and has given explanation for each solution they have proposed for the implementation.,1215665,-1,8109
"The authors do not have a section for proposed changes. Hence, it is not completely clear which changes they are proposing and which changes are already existing. ",1214851,1,8109
The explanations are good. But a layout in the issue-solution form listed sequentially would have looked better.,1215412,1,8109
The author has given a proper explanation of how the things will be implemented by specifying the files that needs to be modified along with how they are going to merge the grades,1216013,-1,8109
The Design document states all the required things right from project design to test plan. Files that will be changed along with how functionality will work/flow are included in the doc clearly.  Suggestion: great work! no suggestions required.,1216187,-1,8060
" The problem statements are much detailed, but they could be more concise. The test plan could probably be elaborated for better explanation. ",1216212,1,8060
the design covers all tthe major aspects well. I feel that the testing plan could be explained and elaborated in a much better way.,1215345,1,8060
The design doc is complete. All the relevant sections have been added.,1215673,-1,8060
Document looks complete.,1217095,-1,8060
"The wiki explains the problem statement very well along with the proposed solution which seems reasonable. But the wiki does not include any test plans as of now. There are a few test cases which can be used to write the test plan, for eg. not adding drop deadline for the assignment itself and assigning each topic a drop deadline and check the behaviour of the system.",1215200,-1,8060
"The design doc clearly explains the project purpose, project design and the test plan.",1215435,-1,8060
"Design is very nicely explained with flowchart makes the design flow very clear. Suggestion : If a screenshot of actual screen where the change needs to be made is added, that would be perfect.",1214971,1,8060
The document is quite comprehensive in its descriptions of the design proposal.,1215885,-1,8060
"Design document has all the necessary information like project design, test plan. The team has gone through their topic deeply and can be seen by their illustration of their implementation. Also, they have included code snippets which show thoroughness of their approach ",1216091,-1,8060
The design documents contain all required part. ,1216797,-1,8060
Impressive write-up. Flow-charts and UML diagrams are well-explained. Detailed explanation of problem statement and solution to be implemented.,1216722,1,8060
lack of group members.  The design process is not very clear.,1215415,1,8060
"Yes, the document incorporates all the functionality,ensuring nothing is missed.",1216188,-1,8060
The design incorporates all the required functionality to a good extent.,1215346,-1,8060
"Yes, it does.",1215674,-1,8060
The doc focusses on eliminating the issue and does not shower any light on the design of the system.,1215201,1,8060
Yes the design incorporates all the functionality required. All the issues are explained clearly and their required solutions are also given.,1215436,-1,8060
Yes all the issues mentioned in the project description are covered along with their proposed Solution. Good Job,1214972,-1,8060
"Design document has outlined the project requirement and issues. They have proposed a solution to each problem. they have even figured the files and methods to be modified. Overall, it looks good.",1216092,-1,8060
The design contains all of the functionality that required. ,1216798,-1,8060
"Yes, it is complete",1216723,-1,8060
The explanation provided is on point to the requirement of the project. All the steps piece up the project completely. No suggestions.,1216189,-1,8060
The overall quality of explanations is precise and clear. Isssue 3 and the test plan can be addressed in more detail. How the testing will be performed must be addressed.,1215347,1,8060
The Issue 2 explanation ans Issue 1 solution 2 explanation is a bit hard to follow or seems to be at a high level. It needs to be broken down. All other descriptions are easy to follow. It would have been more helpful if some screenshots of the tables or the screen shots of the screens were included.,1215675,1,8060
"Very clear, very well organized.",1217097,-1,8060
proposed changes are well explanatory but every function change is in sign_up_sheet controller whereas there are many references present in a few models and other controllers as well,1215202,1,8060
"The explanations given show that they have put thought into their project however in Issue 1 solution 2, they are not clear about the path ahead. They have vaguely stated that the solution might be complex.",1215437,1,8060
The flowchart makes it very clear.,1214973,-1,8060
Everything is explained well and easy to understand.,1215887,-1,8060
The team has explained the solution with flow charts and code snippets. They have even considered the feasibility of their solution which is a good thing as this is a big project so feasibility is a big factor. ,1216093,-1,8060
They explained their plan very well. Both the visual aid and the word they use are very clear. ,1216799,-1,8060
Adequate information given on implementing the solution. Flow charts are impressive.,1216724,-1,8060
Great efforts have been taken to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it. The design will definitely increase the response time. Suggestion: Information about the methods that will be implemented is not given in the design document Availability of such info would have been helpful.,1216190,1,8060
The only issue i feel is iapproach to issue 1 is a bit  complex  or not clear which may lead to increasing the response time of the system.,1215348,1,8060
"Though I couldn't follow everything, overall, the design seems to do the right thing.",1215676,-1,8060
As stated above all the references needs to be checked as signup sheet controller is populating the database and every field should be available to maintain consistency.,1215203,1,8060
" More effort could have been expended on the design because in some places, they are not sure of the direction and just state that they might have to look into the code and discuss with the professor.",1215438,1,8060
There is nothing wrong in current design. Looks good. Suggestion: However Since I have already worked on a similar assignment so I know that similar issue has already been resolved for drop topic deadline. You can reuse the entire code and just change deadline type. Have a look at OSS project topic- 1843.  Check with the Professor once.,1214974,1,8060
All proposed changes seem to be in line with good coding practices and the expertiza system guidelines.,1215888,-1,8060
Their solution sounds good. ,1216094,-1,8060
The design they have right now looks good to me. It does not have any issue. ,1216800,-1,8060
not show which method,1215418,-1,8060
The use of flowcharts describe the functioning of the project exceptionally. Suggestion: Including screen mockups to your doc will add more weight to it.,1216191,1,8060
Clearly defined UML (+1),1216216,-1,8060
Uml diagrams mentioned are excellent and to the mark.,1215349,-1,8060
The UML diagrams does seems to be a bit at a high level. I couldn't get a clear idea of how it would actually be implemented.,1215677,1,8060
Diagrams are very clear and well explained!,1217099,-1,8060
No diagrams shown,1215204,1,8060
One of the best wikis I have reviewed with good diagrams and explanations. The flow diagrams are really good. Kudos,1215439,-1,8060
The diagrams follow the conventions and are detailed and self explanatory. Suggestion : Test Plan is not so clear. Especially the second testcase where it is stated that the dates will be changed accordingly. What dates will be changed and how should be mentioned. A similar flow-chart  will make it very clear as to what you plan to test. ,1214975,1,8060
The flowcharts used are very good and do a great job of conveying the intended purpose of each solution presented.,1215889,-1,8060
They have used UML diagram and flowcharts which aided in understanding their approach and the logic,1216095,-1,8060
Their visual aid is well designed and high quality. It helps the reader understand their total design very well. ,1216801,-1,8060
UML diagrams are well formed. Flow charts are easy to understand. Looks like the team has thoroughly understood the problem statement. ,1216726,-1,8060
no such things like UML.,1215419,1,8060
"The document clearly specifies the problem statement. It seems good enough. They have mentioned the API they are planning to use as well as the files to be modified. However, I would like more details on this API and how they plan to integrate it into their project.",1215708,1,8061

Although it looks like a good start the team can still improve on the design by adding a UML diagram and a test plan. There is a need for a low-level design explanation so that others can understand the technical details of the implementation.,1216772,1,8107
No clarification,1215315,-1,8107
"Both the project purpose and the project design are not very well stated.  In terms of project purpose, although I was expecting it to appear in the introduction part, it actually did not. The part just stated a high-level abstract goal, being transmitting the conflicting message to the grader. But it's not at all stated in detail. So I went to the proposed solution to find the project purpose. In the proposed solution section, Neither project purpose nor project design was well put. It talks about changes that are expected to be implemented in the file. But they are not talked about in detail. This sentence: ""loop through each review not for calculating the average but to compare the new review score with each review score""    seems to be not so easy to be understood. The project design seems also to be in the proposed solution section. There's no detailed modification plan, workflow statement, or anything.  The testing plan looks succinct and helpful enough for a tester to use and check the functionality. ",1214951,1,8107
No detaiiled design on how to do proposed solution no visuals ,1214844,1,8107
The changes are much that is required just some calculated approach of the score which the author has mentioned and seems will be working,1216759,-1,8109
"Similar to my earlier comment, I found this document lacking on details. I also don't think their explanation for deriving the ""score"" to be sufficient. Their explanation is expressed as code, not as a mathematical equation.",1214898,1,8109
Just overview is presented which is explained properly. The technical design is not explained in depth.,1217036,1,8109
Changes are suggested in a well manner but could have been explained in more details.,1216567,1,8109
Changes are not proposed to a suitable extent as they have mostly elaborated on the problem statement. It yet remains for them to implement them and explain in explicit details their action plan to arrive at the solution.  ,1215407,-1,8109
They have mentioned the method to calculate the composite reviews. But where this method is planned to be added in Expertiza is unclear. This needs to be mentioned.,1214852,1,8109
"The team has discussed the implementation details of calculating the composite score. However, as stated above the documentation lacks the detailed design that they are planning to implement.",1215666,1,8109
"It would have been good to show the comparison of the scores calculated with the old model and the new model. This will check if the proposed design is acceptable or just falls in the ""smell"" category.",1215413,1,8109
The design appears to be perfect for now  except for the flow diagram,1216014,1,8109
The design gives a proper explanation of the behavior of the system/functionality,1216760,-1,8109
"From what I can gather, nothing sounds too complicated individually, but the practice of a workflow across multiple pages can become very cumbersome and complex. I don't see any details on how this team plans to mitigate those issues.",1214899,1,8109
This logic to calculate composite score : composite score= Max score -[self review score - peer review score] is basically taking the min scores. Not sure what you are trying to achieve here . It is not a good measure to calculate composite score.,1217037,1,8109
The design looks reasonable for me. ,1216815,-1,8109
"Yes, the designs appears to be good to me. I believe the diagram shown in wiki helped me to understand their understanding",1216568,-1,8109
"As for the designs proposed by the authors it proves to be a redundant check since there is a minimal amount of Design aspect in their doc.  Sure, they have defined an application flow, but that is all there is to it.  1. Nothing about adding a method to any class has been suggested. Only a simple formula for composite score has been written.  2. The design hasn't been implemented to the depth to make it a code let alone make it smelly.  3. Nothing mentioned about the design to make it complicated and the piece of code which they would delve into to ascertain of any pre-existing gems for simplification.  4.

Absolutely, a much more thorough investigation should be carried out and relevant previous work exploration with help solve the cause.",1215408,1,8109
I really like the flow graphs! The helped me understand what you are aiming to do.,1216614,-1,8109
"The application flow help understands how your design work, but maybe you can add more visual aids to help understand your design more easily. ",1216816,1,8109
The flow diagrams are well written and it is easy to understand just looking at them.,1216196,-1,8109
No UMLs given,1216569,1,8109
There is a hint of visual aid in terms of the section of Application flow for the Instructor and student and thus we can say that it does slightly help get a sense of putting things into perspective.  1. None. Both the diagrams seem important enough for the scope of the project and in conjunction with the intended functionalities. 2. The UML diagram is in line with the conventions and follows suite. 3. The diagram of the instructor can be said to be bordering on one to be too high level and should go a bit more into detail.  ,1215409,1,8109
No UML diagrams or screenshots have been included currently.,1217038,1,8109
As mentioned above the flow diagram should be completely modified ,1216015,1,8109
Diagrams are explanatory but few but I think they are sufficient,1216761,-1,8109
"Same comments as earlier. A flow chart diagram is provided, but it provides little benefit and the presentation for the score algorithm is vague and simple. I would like to see more details about the process in an actor diagram.",1214900,1,8109
The application plan diagram has been shown. It distinguishes between Instructor and Student.,1215414,-1,8109
Application flow is present and done well. UML diagrams need to be added.,1214853,1,8109
The team has provided the application flow diagram which helps to understand the working of the project. It would be helpful to add design details and the diagram for same so that others can understand the implementation as well.,1215667,1,8109
The team has included all the topics required for the documentation.,1215310,-1,8032
"The authors have included all the necessary sections of the design document. However, the document seems to be a very high-level explanation of the problem statement and proposed solutions.

There are no solutions proposed. Just the issues are listed and explained. A possible screenshot or a flow diagram would have been better to catch the proposed solution.,1215397,1,8108
There were no such solutions listed on the basis of which I could suggest some better solutions. A couple of test cases or issue resolutions would have been handful for further suggestions.,1215398,1,8108
There are no diagrams present. It would have been great if a screenshot of a test case or flow diagram was given.,1215399,1,8108
"The project is complete and sound enough in its approach and the implementations and the test plan has been well devised and just shy of application. Even so, in their project they lack two sections of key note, i.e. one is the project design and the solution approach.     ",1215425,1,8108

Changes are not proposed to a suitable extent as they have mostly elaborated on the problem statement.  It yet remains for them to implement them and explain in explicit details their action plan to arrive at the solution.  They have even yet to work on the most important part that is figuring out the solution. ,1215427,1,8108
"As for the designs proposed by the authors it proves to be a redundant check since there is a minimal amount of Design aspect in their doc.  They haven't even defined an application flow.  1. Nothing about adding a method to any class has been suggested. As per them most important things are going to be given in the final doc design.  2. The design hasn't been implemented to the depth to make it a code let alone make it smelly.  3. Nothing mentioned about the design to make it complicated and the piece of code which they would delve into to ascertain of any pre-existing gems for simplification.  4.

The author has not suggested any changes as of now.,1217021,1,8108

The design covers the functionalities but there seem to be no concrete solutions for the same. Some more explanations is expected.,1216773,1,8107
Not explained properly,1215316,-1,8107
"The requirement here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Br9hm-SWIvl5ibWSfRVjmiYTQl5j27l8slWhv2iUCqQ/edit#heading=h.654oe3xw5p73  totally appeared in the design document. This is very good because there's a high-level goal being stated. However, the ""important files"" part which includes the Open github issue, delayed mailer, response controller and response model, only model is mentioned and the other four are not mentioned at all. It should be great if all of these can be mentioned.",1214952,1,8107
"Yes, in my opinion the team has understood the topic well and clearly listed all the functionality as described in the design document. Good Job !!",1215808,1,8107

"Yes, they include all the functionality in the wiki page. They can work it better if they add more details and some visual aids.",1216778,-1,8107
Not descriptive,1215386,-1,8107
"The authors have provided a brief design approach of storing the URL and looping it into an email notification, so that instructor would be able to identify which review has been mapped to it. Improvisation: You can try adding information about new functions you wish to add, and if yes, which of the files identified by the mentor do you want to add the function to. This will increase the depth of your design document.",1214997,-1,8107
"The design is rather straightforward, incorporates all the functionality required.",1216456,-1,8107
Have explained the project as according to the given description.,1216783,-1,8107
Just few high-level details (very generic) are provided which makes it hard to visualize a solution,1216774,-1,8107
No changes,1215317,-1,8107
"The changes being proposed is not comprehensive. The changes in the controller is not mentioned at all. The current issue and end picture are also very hard to follow. I have the following questions: 1. How will the UI look like when the conflict- mentioning implementation is resolved? Or only email notification and no changes in the UI? 2. I cannot understand clearly the meaning of this sentence: ""loop through each review not for calculating the average but to compare the new review score with each review score"".",1214953,1,8107
"The authors propose changes in an extremely concise manner. The idea that the team proposes to follow seems logical, but I would suggest them to include a dummy example or sample pseudocode so that the english explanantion is backed up with an idea of the code as well. Such as this-: 1) Review X is submitted 2) Loop through Review 1......n If abs(Review n score - Review X score) >= (some value) store Review n URL in list  ",1215809,-1,8107
Their explanations are not detailed and sometimes it's not easy to understand.,1217016,1,8107

The authors have explained the changes in a brief manner which are easy to understand,1215312,-1,8107
"It looks to me from the document that the authors are clear about their implementation. Suggestion: They can elaborate more by specifying how do they intend to store the URLs to the reviews, how are they identifying the two distinctly different reviews. They can also add a basic flow of their proposed solution. This will enhance the explanation.",1214998,-1,8107
"The explanations are brief and to the point, thought that seems to be due to the nature of the problem statement itself.",1216457,-1,8107
Solution and class level details are missing.,1216784,1,8107
The design is specified to a certain extent but does not provide where the changes will take place or what classes or tables will be affected.,1216775,1,8107
No plan introduced,1215318,1,8107
"5) more effort should be expended on the design. I think there are a lot of problems in the design. The changes to the controller, where the notification is implemented, such questions are not addressed. Also, the questions listed in the above answers are not addressed.",1214954,1,8107
"The authors propose a sound logic to improve the functionality required. However, I would suggest the team to think about looping over each and every review. This may increase the response time of the system. Perhaps more interaction with the instructors could help the team come up with a less complex solution.",1215810,1,8107
"Frankly, I can not see their concrete designs from their doc. ",1217017,1,8107
The design appears to be complete.,1216780,-1,8107
Needs to work a bit on the plan,1215388,1,8107
"The explanation is descriptive and explains the logic behind the solution which is think should work. However, I believe that team should can add the explanation about the files and classes they tend to make changes in. The team can now focus on implementation of the code.",1215313,1,8107
"The new design does not talk about any methods or class definitions, thus I cannot comment on this. Suggestion: You can add more information on methods or any usage of design patterns in order to make the review effective and useful.",1214999,-1,8107
"The new design loops through all existing reviews to compare new review scores with the original ones, and stores the URL of a specific iteration if its limit is exceeded. By waiting for all reviews to be looped in before sending email, it may increase the response time of the system.",1216458,-1,8107
The design explains much of the detail about the problem but classes which will be affected or needs changes are not provided.,1216785,1,8107
"Design document explains the entire project flow very well. The  objectives/goals are clearly stated in the doc along with the approach which team will be following in future.The  flowchart explains the functionality very well. Overall, the doc is easy to understand.  Suggestion: Team should include test plan in the doc.",1215185,-1,8083
The design document is well planned and does not miss any of the significant details.,1215160,-1,8083
"The write up could've been organized in a better manner and the authors could've given more attention to detail. For example, I see they mention the project E1791 but without a hyperlink, it was a little difficult to reach the documentation of that project (the search bar didn't help matters too). It could've been stated more clearly what requirement the earlier project implemented, and what improvement this one does. Also, the document does not cover testing - even some basic test cases. (A little formatting inconsistency - the heading ""Flowchart"" always has a colon attached to it but none of the other headings do!)",1216956,1,8083
The placement of the document could be changed to make it more readable and the flow of the document to be proper for example the objective should be shifted above the database schema. They have also not included the test cases,1216016,1,8083
"The document seems to be generally well-designed. However, I believe that they have glossed over how a link is said to be ""closed"". They properly described the additional functionality and the challenges they will likely face.",1214886,-1,8083
all basic elements are included.,1216540,-1,8083
"There are no sections titled project purpose, project design, or testing plan. However, much of the information required to create those sections is provided.",1216657,1,8083
the design document seems to be well written and detailed with respect to the objectives that need to be achieved. The team explains well the purpose and project design. they have included the database tables which will be modified. the team could add a testing plan to make the design document look complete.,1216440,-1,8083
The design doc is well written and the points to be completed are clearly expressed.,1216385,-1,8083

"I felt there was just too much overlap and with the doc from previous year: 2017 Project . Even if the current project is to extend a previous one, the documents aren't supposed to be copied almost word to word. The only major addition I see is the last section. None of the diagram correlate to the new changes being made; they are contextual to the older project. Testing plan is missing from the document. From what I know, even the development projects need that section. Even when the older document was used, no references have been provided for it.",1216510,1,8083
"The design document is very thorough, indicating what's the problem, how system works and proposed soluion.",1215245,-1,8083
"The introduction paragraph contains bullets that are identical to E1791 which is surprising.  The flowchart does not cover ""No"" or negative cases and is thus incomplete. What is logged in the DB and how exactly is ""start"" and ""end"" time is very ambiguous.  Apart from a mention of ""merging the data of the details page on the current report page."" in the introduction, I cannot see any further discussion of this particular objective. For auto-save, you could think of using the on-unload event of JavaScript (like onload event). Also, setTimeout doesn't seem to be an efficient idea, since that would make too many number of calls from the page (I guess you would be sending an Ajax request, which is asynchronous). A next call might be made before a previous call response is handled. When you say ""For each time the reviewer starts a review, it will check whether a previous record for this review already exists in the database. If it does exist then it will update the end time of this record"" - what if I open a review that I had done two days back? As soon as I open the page, will it mark end_time as now() .? In that case, does that mean I have done this review for 2 days..?  ",1216957,1,8083
The design incorporates all the required functionalities. The team could have added Use cases or CRC cards to help convey which parts of code they plan to change and how. Overall the team conveys their objectives.,1216441,1,8083
"Yes, they've decided to do all there is in the scope of the project",1216386,-1,8083
Yes the design tries to cover all the requested features.,1214855,-1,8083
No all functionalities are not incorporated. Design and implement a solution that handle GitHub is missing.,1216683,1,8083
Yes the functionality is explained.,1216511,-1,8083
Enough explanation about how the team will tackle the problem statement has been given. Overall explanation is good.  ,1215187,-1,8083
The explanations provided are granular and do not leave any lingering questions in the readers mind.,1215162,-1,8083
"Organization of the document is missing. It quotes a problem statement, presents a flowchart, and states a pair of objective-solutions yet again. From this write up, I could understand that they're trying to do 3 things: log the time that each review takes (by improving an earlier project), auto-save reviews, and merge data of details page on report page. I cannot find these clearly separated.",1216958,1,8083
The explanation given is quite easy to understand and explains the solution to the point,1216018,-1,8083
"While I understand conceptually, I don't believe they explained their changes in appropriate detail. Simply describing additional columns and a flow chart misses the biggest part of these changes which is user experience. How will windows pop-up? What will the new data look like after a review is complete?",1214888,1,8083
The authors propose two changes and have mentioned in detail about the flow in which they will make changes. They could benefit from drawing simple LoFi UI cards to illustrate how the new review page might look like which will benefit them in improving their UI design and proper representation of data before they actually spend the man hours in coding it. Overall the have explained the process in detail  and clean fashion.,1216442,1,8083
The autosave feature is a pain right now and it is buggy(not sure if it is in the scope of this project) so an option can be given to choose autosave the data after a set of intervals like 5/10/15 mins,1214856,1,8083
explanation is good and easy to understand. proposed solution looks good as well. Design and implement a solution that handle GitHub hasn't been explained.,1216684,1,8083
"The Introduction was a little confusing as to what this team is going to do. Rather the ""Objective of the project"" section is what clarifies the change the are doing and from that I was able to understand what already exists. The Objective of the project section contains the proposed solutions when the proposed solutions ought to be a separate section.",1216512,1,8083
The design seems to be precise. The description of the changes are provided in detail.The team also has mentioned about the API that they will use. They have clearly mentioned about the approach that they will use. Enough efforts have been taken by the team to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it. ,1215188,-1,8083
"I think the writing could be done better, with more explanation on why the solutions mentioned in the last paragraph are taken, and what other approaches were considered. Or an explanation of why no alternative exists. With regard to design, explained in detail in a previous comment.",1216959,1,8083
"These changes seem to be appropriate for the objectives they have. Only a small set of files are being changed, and the functionality is isolated well. My only feedback here is that there is likely a place to create helpers or utilities for time tracking.",1214889,1,8083
The authors seem to have understood the project and know what changes need to be made to what files. The changes seem to be targeted to the correct classes and preliminary investigation reveals that it does seem to follow DRY principles. They might want to make their design diagram more simplified which will not only help in making it look readable and also help in implementing the code effectively. This will help in reducing convoluted code.,1216443,1,8083
The design appears to be sound considering the expected outcomes of the project and it doesn't seem that it will create any dependency mismatch as well.,1216388,-1,8083
It isn't clear what all the Review statistics will be shown in the column. If it is just the time spent then that's fine. But if there are other details as well then it needs to be explained how so much data will be shown in a single cell w/o affecting readability.,1216513,1,8083

The purpose is stated in five different small goals separately: make changes in view submissions, view scores, view review report, author feedback report and teammate review report five different parts. In terms of project purpose, it's comprehensive and detailed. As for project design, it is carefully outlined in the ""Solution"" and ""Modification of files"" part. I think the project design might needs a bit more description, in terms of what steps needs to do first, and what steps needs to be done next. It seems that all the changes are for the UI, but is there any UI that can be served as a pattern, for the usage of others? Or is there any implementation of one UI dependent on the implementation of another? Here, I think there needs to be more detailed steps. The testing plan includes detailed steps in terms of how to test the implementation as a  end user. I like it very much because it is both succinct and very intuitive. It will be good to add some sample pictures when the project is over and some pictures that display the functionality becomes available.",1214931,1,8031
"It says what they will do, but it seems high level. Would appreciate some diagrams or mockups",1214839,-1,8031
"The team has done a good job in listing down the project requirements and design. However I suggest the testing plan be improved. In place of giving steps on how a reviewer should test the project, the team should instead list how they wish to write tests for the functionality added, for example-: list down a dummy set of data in any one report view, mention how they would like to write a test for this. Say using capybara, and then how to corroborate the result from the view.",1216375,1,8031
The doc seems complete. All aspects of the problem statement are covered and test plan is also included. A use-case diagram will be useful to add.,1216450,-1,8031
The authors can add the project's purpose (why this feature is important/helpful). The authors have mentioned the plan to use tablesorter jQuery to sort the table but No design plan is included. I suggest the team to remove the introduction to expertiza since it was clearly mentioned in the requirements to not include it.,1215255,-1,8031
Design doc contains everything in clear explanation,1216116,-1,8031
"The design doc for now, specifies only the issues. No approach has been given yet on prospective solutions  ",1216631,1,8031
"The design document has clearly mentioned the problem statement and the subtasks that need to be performed. However, it looks a bit incomplete to me. Suggestions: Try adding what were your proposed approaches and a clear reasoning as to why did you choose a particular approach. You can simply remove the statement on Expertiza, as the professor has clearly advised us to avoid doing it.  ",1214926,1,8031
"The design document is comprehensive and covers most of the relevant topics. General problem statement is defined clearly and then divided into multiple specific subtasks which will be addressed by the project. The solution to the problem specifies the library that will be utilized in the implementation and classifies several types of sorting that needs to be done. This is followed by the files that will be modified in the scope of this project. The primary problem is that the document does not provide any extensive discussion about the possible design decisions and implementation strategies. It is stated that scripts have been added at the top of the file to sort the contents of table. I would suggest elaborating on the specifics, what functions are called and how will the javascript function be tied to the html table contents.",1215225,1,8031
"The team provided sufficient information on the project purpose and design. The test plan is adequate.        It would be better, to provide a solid reasoning for incorporating different sorting. Few sorting implementations, ie) by name and team are intuitive. But the need to sort the Author feedback report and teammate review report, in the way suggested by the team, the reasoning is not very apparent. Need more problem statement elaboration.  ",1216021,1,8031
"The document mentions the tools of JQuery sorting table, in fact which API or any sample code that can be referenced to is expected in the document. Also, this project seems to focus on the view part of Expertiza, so the test plan should be more detailed, cover more edge case. ",1216732,-1,8031
"Unfortunately no visual aids are provided in the design. I would suggest providing the simplified UML diagram that does not necessarily capture all of the classes that interact with the ones that will be modified by the team, but the ones that the team finds will be most relevant to the reader.",1215229,1,8031
NO UML diagram,1216025,1,8031
"Although the write-up explains the things clearly, visual aids will leverage your proposed changes. Suggestions: You can include UML diagrams like use cases, application flow to elaborate more on your additional changes. You can mock the changes ( editing html page to show proposed changes) which will really help in a better understanding of your design.      ",1214930,1,8031
Did not find any diagrams in the Wiki.,1215841,1,8031
There are no diagrams present. It would have been great if a screenshot of a test case or flow diagram was given.,1216635,-1,8031
No use of any visual aids.,1215259,1,8031
"Although screenshots are available on the Projects page, it would have been easier to visualize if the page mockups were added in the design document too.",1216120,1,8031
"The authors have not included any diagrams. Though the purpose and proposed changes are understood, the team could have mentioned use case diagrams or a flow chart explaining the flow of the functionality.",1216454,1,8031
no visuals at all,1214843,1,8031
"Unfortunately the team has missed out on adding any visual aids to the document. I would suggest that where you list all the column names which would be sorted in each view, also add a screenshot of how that view looks at the present moment, and a low-fi sketch of how the view would look after the changes have been implemented.",1216379,-1,8031
No UML diagram.,1215634,1,8031
"The author has not used any UML diagram, nor any other forms of pictorial representation. ",1217078,-1,8031
"Although the textual explanation is succinct and nice, there's not yet diagrams or other visual aids available. I think a diagram that depicts the workflow might be very helpful.",1214935,-1,8031
how to encapsulate that sorting table for future use?,1216735,1,8031
"1)     The team has already identified the files to be changed, which is a good thing. It looks like, all changes will be handled in the client-side, so not applicable 2)     I assume, as it is nowhere mentioned, they would be writing a custom js file, the team plans to repeat some of the custom written code, if same functionality is required in 2 different file, which could violate DRY. Team might need to consider such possibility. 3)     NO, the team is already optimizing by leverage some JavaScript libraries. 4)     It would as user opts to sort, but here it seems to be a necessary evil. 5)     Yes, the team can elaborate more on their design approach and provide visual aids to help reader understand the sorting intended better.    ",1216024,-1,8031
"The authors talk about adding the tablesorter class to the html table and using javascript scripts for further action. There are no apparent problems with this strategy, however I would suggest for the team to elaborate and provide more details on the implementation. For example, it is not possible to understand what the javascript part will look like, how many functions will be used or how they will interact with html.",1215228,-1,8031
Mainly needs html files to be changed and they have mentioned them which looks good ,1215633,-1,8031
"As mentioned above, the design part is pretty weak for a writeup, and needs to be further worked upon.",1217077,1,8031
"I believe more effort should be expended on the design. Currently, it is still not so comprehensive. A lot of details can be added in terms of how each file should be modified and how the sorting will be implemented.",1214934,1,8031
"The design proposed by the authors appears to be sound. Since this project is only to sort the views, there will be no code added to either the models or controllers. I hope the team only adds one sorting function per view and allows that one function to handle sorting for different columns in that view.",1216378,-1,8031
"I don't think the authors plan to add methods to the wrong class. They are modifying the right files. The new design does not appear to potentially make the code ""smelly"". The team is using one of the existing gems in their design.",1216453,-1,8031
"The solution looks like it doesnt add any overhead and the doesnt make the code ""smelly""",1216119,-1,8031
The solution seems right.,1215258,-1,8031
The team has not mentioned about how they are planning to do the changes.,1216634,1,8031
"I think that the authors have identified changes in the html.erb files, which looks right to me. As it only deals with the sorted view of instructor reports, the changes must go in the views part of the application.  Suggestion: You can try to add a bit of information on whether your changes include addition of new code, deletion of existing code, or just slightly modifying or extending the existing code and justify it. Query: Do you plan on creating  a drop-down like option to choose from which type of sorting is to be performed? If yes, it is an add-on user-friendly feature.",1214929,-1,8031
need some diagram or prototype. ,1216734,1,8031
"It states the internal jQuery library they plan to use to achieve the sorting, again more details on implementations are required to be documented to assess the quality of the solution.",1216023,1,8031
The authors provide a list of files that will be modified in the scope of this project and a high level overview of what needs to be done. The rationale behind using a tablesorter jQuery library and defining the code in the script seems reasonable but the team needs to discuss more details to further clarity the solution. ,1215227,1,8031
The authors have taken efforts to identify the right places for making the identified changes. It seems that they have already done some changes. Suggestions: I feel that the proposed changes on a high level. You might want to go a level deeper to explain what will your changes be like. You might also consider adding use case for your changes. ,1214928,1,8031
Team have shared the link for the TableSorter which explains the functionality,1215839,-1,8031
Solutions have been proposed. How they are going to do that is not mentioned.,1216633,1,8031
The explanations can be more detailed. Overall understandable.,1215257,-1,8031
"The changes being proposed including the modification of 6 files: submission, team title, view, review-report, feedback report, and teammate review report. I think the lists of modifications are comprehensive. But more details needs to be stated: How should we change this list_submissions.html.erb file? Should we only change some lines or should we change the entire pattern? In which file will the sorting be implemented? there does have information on how to sort by JQuery, but there's not yet information, in terms of which file, which part needs to be changed.  ",1214933,1,8031
Adequate explanation was given,1216118,-1,8031
It is easy to follow the changes that the authors have proposed.,1216452,-1,8031
"The proposed changes section of the wikipedia clearly mentions the column names the team would implement sort on. But, how they want to implement the sort could be explained a little more in detail. They mention they would use tablesorter JQuery, but I would suggest to add some sort of a pseudocode that would explain better how exactly does the sorting work.",1216377,1,8031
could use more detail,1214841,1,8031
"The explaiantions provided by the author are at a very high level view, and needs further drilling down into the implementation.",1217076,1,8031
Changes look good.,1215632,-1,8031
" Yes, their design seems to cover all the intended functionality requested for the project. But how the team will achieve the few not so straight-forward sorting such as the one indicated in Author feedback report is not clear to conclude, their approach will achieve the intended functionality    ",1216022,1,8031
"The design document lists every issue that is being addressed in the project, providing comprehensive details on the functionality that is required for each one.",1215226,-1,8031
"Yes, as per the solution provided, it does seem that the design incorporates the required functionality. It considers sorting on all the specified fields. Suggestions: Since you have mentioned the use of jQuery tablesorte, you may also add explanation as to what is tablesorter and try explaining atleast for one field (e.g. name) as to how does it work to sort the entries.    ",1214927,-1,8031
Please add more details about the solution. How to code for that functionality is yet to be thought of.,1216632,1,8031
"Though the pull request has been passed, but the writeup does not explain the details of the implementation, like what sorting algorithm the team has implemented using jQuery etc. The design part of the writeup is very hollow, and needs further refinement.",1217075,1,8031
"Yes, all the functionalities, including viewing submission, viewing scores, viewing review report, author feedback report, teammate review report are all available. I believe a more intuitive, detailed explanation or description might be even more useful, while describing the functionalities in the design. Here, such design is still just simply stated as the project goal.",1214932,1,8031
The wiki is detailed enough that it mentions all the functinoalities required in the project. The team has made sure to not miss out on any functionality and they even took out time to list the column names in each report they would add the sort feature to. Good work guys.,1216376,-1,8031
I think the authors have incorporated most of the functionality in the design document.,1216451,-1,8031
Design document contains all the functionality required.,1216117,-1,8031
It incorporates all the functionalites.,1215631,-1,8031
The project's purpose and issues are well stated. But the project design have not been included.,1215984,1,8036
"The project design and the testing plans are well laid out. Solution part does not have any description in it, says it will be given in the detailed design. Could have given some idea on the solution with some flow diagram.",1215395,1,8036
"The project writeup is not complete at this moment, as there are a lot of things missing. Like what the team plan to do, and what concretey are its testing techniques. It only mentions the problem statement, and an overview of testing.",1217019,1,8036
Seems like all parts of the design document need more details. ,1216626,1,8036
Only problem statement is explained and nothing about how the team will design the solution. Please add design and UML diagrams.,1216390,1,8036
"The project is complete and sound enough in its approach and the implementations and the test plan has been well devised and just shy of application. Even so, in their project they lack two sections of key note, i.e. one is the project design and the solution approach.     ",1215425,0,8036
"Implementation details are missing, but the testing plan is ready. ",1216931,1,8036
The doc clearly explains the agenda of the whole project. Seems like the team still needs time to understand and devise a plan to tackle the issues identified.,1216202,1,8036
UML diagrams and the solution proposed by the authors to solve the issues is missing.,1216232,1,8036
Team have decided to give all details after final submission. A Design Doc should be available before starting the Project. I would recommend to provide few details on Project Design (classes involved in the project or application flow etc),1215847,1,8036

It includes all the sections,1216932,-1,8036

No changes proposed.,1216392,1,8036
Changes are not proposed to a suitable extent as they have mostly elaborated on the problem statement.  It yet remains for them to implement them and explain in explicit details their action plan to arrive at the solution.  They have even yet to work on the most important part that is figuring out the solution. ,1215427,1,8036

"As for the designs proposed by the authors it proves to be a redundant check since there is a minimal amount of Design aspect in their doc.  They haven't even defined an application flow.  1. Nothing about adding a method to any class has been suggested. As per them most important things are going to be given in the final doc design.  2. The design hasn't been implemented to the depth to make it a code let alone make it smelly.  3. Nothing mentioned about the design to make it complicated and the piece of code which they would delve into to ascertain of any pre-existing gems for simplification.  4. This too is hard to reach a conclusion on since not enough details to answer it with certainty.  5. Yes.

Test Plan is not present.,1216981,1,8044
Yes the design looks complete,1214911,-1,8044
So far the idea is clearly articulated. Few things which are not defined are explicitly stated in the doc.,1214891,-1,8044
"The high-level design which is needed to start with the work looks prominent. As the project proceeds, few intricacies resulting due to design conflicts, scalability need to be addressed as and when required. But the team has laid out a solid foundation to begin with.",1215688,1,8044
"Yes, it does",1216982,-1,8044
"Includes everything, as far as I can tell.",1215611,-1,8044
Yes. The design document incorporates all the functionalities stated in problem statement. ,1215002,-1,8044
The design has not been stated explicitly so its difficult to comment only with the flow and UML diagrams whether it is appropriate and the best way to address the issue.,1215636,-1,8044
Authors have a clear idea of what details need to be included to make the audience understand the purpose of the project. The design document is sufficient to get the basic idea and implementation.,1215689,-1,8044
The design does incorporate the functionality required of making reviews public allowing the students to toggle the visibility of review submitted. It is descriptive and easy to understand.,1216287,-1,8044
Team has not proposed any solution for fixing the issue. They should add their approach in the documentation.,1215637,1,8044
It's not a great explanation,1215292,-1,8044
"Document is explained well. Also the flow of document is good. Team can add screenshots of existing documents, also some diagram to explain the solution well.",1215003,-1,8044
The proposed flows and project tasks are sufficiently detailed that I can understand the relationship between the issue and how they're going to solve it in each step.,1215612,-1,8044
"Though an approach has been mentioned of the proposed changes, but they do not have a test plan.",1216477,1,8044
The step by step instructions are detailed and is good.,1214913,-1,8044
What is wrong with the current implementation is clearly not stated.,1214893,1,8044
The authors have explained the workflow very well with respect to the different types of users involved in the particular feature. The language is simple to follow.,1215690,-1,8044
The proposals given by the team are reasonable and adequately cover the features to be established during the course of the project. The changes suggested follow the desired requirements. ,1216288,-1,8044
"I think overall it looks good. However, a bit more low-level details may give better insight about such issues.",1216750,1,8044
The team has not addressed the project design approach and the proposed implementation details in the documentation.,1215638,-1,8044
The implementation plan is not there,1215293,1,8044
"1. Authors solution do not seem to create methods to wrong classes. 2. New design code does not make the code ""smelly"". 3. No new gem required. Explained solution is adequate. 4. Proposed design should not hamper system performance. 5. Well efforts expended on the design  ",1215004,-1,8044
"I don't have any issues with the design, looking forward to seeing some code snippets to understand it better.",1215613,-1,8044
"As mentioned in their Approach section, the team decided on adding some functionalities like checkboxes and views. I find these changes perfect for the problem statement given.",1216478,-1,8044
Implementation details haven't been added yet but that's fine as it hasn't been started yet.,1214914,-1,8044
The design looks fine but no explanation as to why this is done? Is it already existing or is this a new feature?,1214894,-1,8044
The design proposed by the team looks complex in terms of the functionalities desired. They must backup these changes by providing a pictorial representation of the task like the one described in the documentation. This can help to understand the project in a better way.,1216289,1,8044
I think the UML diagram can be improved further by adding the classes that are related to the use cases separately.  ,1216751,-1,8044
The team has done a commendable job in creating a very detailed UML diagram and explaining the case of every user very well.,1215639,-1,8044
No UML diagrams,1215294,-1,8044
"No UML diagrams included in the document. Please include application flow diagram, state diagram or sequence diagram or Use Case diagrams to make the document for readable.  ",1215005,1,8044

"Only a single UML diagram is present, but I'd have appreciated a couple of flow charts to accompany the expected flows.",1215614,-1,8044
They have used a USE case diagram to explain flow. I found it quite understandable and all the steps are clearly drawn out in the diagram. It clearly explains the steps required to approach a situation.,1216479,-1,8044
Created a great visual aid which helps us explain the plan.,1216985,1,8044
"The document contains a UML Use Case Diagram that analyze the system's requirements and describes the actors involved and the relationship between them. It helps to understand the overview of the project details. However, it can certainly make use of a flow diagram in the Expected Flow section that gives more clarity about the sequence of actions. The flow diagram can follow from the use case diagram to show the tasks performed by the actors in a serial order.  ",1216290,-1,8044
"The authors have explained the changes to be made to the system, including screenshots of the tables, UML diagrams as well as all the files that will be modified. Suggestion: Although all the details are explained well in the document, by writing the changes proposed to the files in bullet points or by using a diagram the document will be easier to read.",1220167,-1,8031
"They made clear explanation about their task. For example, their provide pictures to show what they need to do.  ",1217188,-1,8031
"   Yes, the team has elaborated their design approach and changes to system in detail. They have mentioned all the file changes and also provided sample code for reader understanding.",1218982,-1,8031
"The design document clearly specifies all the issues that are going to be addressed by this project. UI views are provided which help the reader to better understand the scope of the requirements. Moreover, the authors list the files that are going to be modified and the authors comprehensively describe how the jQuery tablesorter 2.0 library will be used for three types of sorting. One minor improvement would be to highlight the parts associated with introduced changes that link html table with the library for better readability.",1218865,-1,8031
"The authors have explained about their changes neatly, including previous suggestions. They have added detailed description about tablesorter which they plan to implement. The tablesorter is used to sort data for multiple fields for a table, using multi-tbody sorting. They plan to use it in the grades and review_mapping views. They do not plan to implement in their drop-down, but display the sorted data itself on loading the page.  The changes look more clear to me, as they have been able to implement the changes in the table view using multi-tbody sorting for submissions table. I think that introduction to Expertiza is highly unnecessary and should be removed,",1219551,1,8031
Great improvements compared to the previous submission. Now its a Very well written document. Good job team.,1220633,-1,8031
"The team has added uml diagrams, images of related web pages and provided details on jQuery tablesorter that explains well the changes the team plans to make.",1219172,-1,8031
The authors have explained enough about the changes,1220279,-1,8031
The wiki is detailed enough that it mentions all the functionalities required in the project. The team has made sure to explain all the changes they wish to make to the system. They list all columns that need to be sorted and how they will implement the sorting.,1219911,-1,8031
"Yes, the changes are well explained. There are a lot of pictures, snipped screen shots to help explain the changes to be made. There's one issue that the screenshots are not very clear, since it's big. It would look better of the screenshots can be clearer.",1218962,1,8031
"Yes, the authors have significantly improved the writeup, and very adequately explained the changes that they've made.",1219774,-1,8031
The design is very efficient and follows the standardized software engineering practices. ,1219775,-1,8031
"The design is sound because it has plans of file modification, of implemented solution, and very detailed testing plan. The DRY principle might not be well followed, since in each testing, the tester needs to log in as a super_administrator2 again. And there are five testings. ",1218963,1,8031
"the design is sound and easy to understand. The design proposed also sounds logical, i.e to sort team names alphabetically, and grades numerically. To sort by both ascending and descending order.",1219912,-1,8031
"Yes, the design seems to be sound.",1220168,-1,8031
The authors have justified the use of jQuery table sorter by listing its advantages.,1219173,-1,8031
The team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made. the design looks good and easy to implement. ,1220634,-1,8031
"The design appears to be specific to the requirements. For this, they have used a UML design which basically explains the flow of the use-case. They have not used any principles or design patterns. However, there does not seem a need to use any, as their changes are limited to the html view and making a call to the tablesorter using JQuery. As per the document, the design does not make any redundant changes or unnecessary changes to the code. Thus, they have done a good job by optimizing the changes.",1219552,-1,8031
"The authors have improved the part of the document that describes the interactions between html and javascript parts since the 1st round. While this assignment does not require an extensive discussion about the design principles or patterns, it would be better if the document explicitly addressed this topic.",1218866,-1,8031
"Yes, as its sorting, not much scope on design approach. Yet the team has documented well on their approach regarding multi-level sortings that they are undertaking in few pages. They have also considered cross-browser compatibility of their jQuery library, which is a common design miss during client-side changes.",1218983,-1,8031
"This project is not very difficult, so they don't need to follow some principles or patterns.",1217189,-1,8031
"The design is simple, they are adding an external JQuery library to achieve the intended sorting functionality and will be adding custom js to achieve further functionalities. As indicated earlier, not clear as to this custom js will be included in multiple pages.",1218984,1,8031
This their design is very simple and clear.,1217190,-1,8031
"The modifications that are suggested by the team are minimalistic and cover the changes that are necessary for the javascript library to work. While it is possible to infer the majority of changes that will be introduced in this project, it would be better if the authors elaborated on the implementation of all the views as opposed to discussing only the ""view submissions"" table. ",1218867,1,8031
"Yes, the design is as simple as it can be. The current scenario is explained with adequate screenshots, and the changes are explained by stating the field to be used for sorting the table. A mock-up screen of the expected output would have made it even better to understand, however reading the material is sufficient as well. The changes are not complex, as they interact with a single view at a time. The tablesorter function is also called for each view, e.g. view_submissions layout.",1219553,-1,8031
"yes, the design is the simplest I could think about. But it doesn't include how to change the files.  I think it can still be as simple and succinct if the modifications of files can be included. On the other hand, the expected result seems to be too long. There's too many screenshots",1218964,1,8031
"Yes, the design is very simple to understand, and also the implementation is pretty clear and effective.",1219776,-1,8031
"Yes, the solution proposed is simple by using the  jQuery tablesorter gem.",1220169,-1,8031
The design is extremely simple and easy to understand. Good work guys :),1219913,-1,8031
The design looks simple and clear.,1220635,1,8031
The use of jQuery plugin sounds simple and easy to use.,1219174,1,8031
"The screenshots of the expected result and the UML diagram are good, But the screenshots can be smaller to make the page more user-friendly. The UML diagram can be better if it's designed as a design plan diagram instead of a user diagram, which simply states how the reader is to approach this. Or it could be better if we have both.",1218965,-1,8031
"The authors have included a UML diagram which explains a flow of the diagram The document does not strike a balance in the use of visualization. It lacks at illustrating the changes using appropriate use-cases, mock-up screens to show the expected changes as opposed to the current scenario. The mock-up screen can include sorted values of the field whose headers you clicked upon. Also, there is no need of other visualization aids such as class diagrams, as the modifications are limited to views. ",1219554,1,8031
"There is some explanation about the general idea of what needs to be added to implement the new functionality; however, there are several sections missing that give light to the details of implementation and how this is tested to ensure correctness. Adding a description of where and how this new model will be developed with the existing image would  be beneficial for a thorough understanding of the reader. This could also be achieved by rearranging the logic of the sections as sum sections elude to purpose and intent of implementation.",1218952,1,8093
"The authors have provided a high level view of the changes which are suposed to be made to the system. But since the author hasn't implemented anything until now, it is tough to justify the changes proposed by the author.",1219714,1,8093
"The changes are mentioned, but not in a concise section, which I suggest would make the documentation easier to read.",1220222,-1,8093
There are a moderate amount of spelling and grammatical errors.,1219347,1,8093
the document is clear. and they added changes that have been pointed out in the previous review ..good job team!,1220809,-1,8093
"Yes, they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection. They have given proper UML diagrams and then showcased in the ""New Model"", ""New Controller"" and ""New Views"" section. ",1218937,-1,8093
The changes to be made are clearly stated and explained,1219147,-1,8093
The doc explains the entire project agenda very clearly. ,1219182,-1,8093
A detailed explanation would have been better,1217696,1,8093
Testing plan is still missing. The author has given a very high level view of the changes to be incorporated in the system. There is not much of an implementation.,1220663,1,8093
"The team has included all the details required to implement the given requirement. The wiki has complete details related to requirements , analysis of current designs and changes required to achieve the required functionality. overall great job !",1219759,-1,8093
The stated design seems to be appropriate. Following a close representation of the current project bidding structure would prove successful. It would have been beneficial to supply more details on how the design would be implemented and could help in the justification of the choices this team used.,1218953,1,8093
"Yes, the design proposed by the author seem sound enough. However, the author has only given a high level view of the proposed design. The author should delve deeper into the concept more while describing the intended design.",1219715,1,8093
The design is well-considered and design principles are being considered when implementing the design.,1220223,-1,8093
"The design is the strong point and it is easily understandable, New model table idea is good",1220810,-1,8093
The design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the diagram and they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the Workflow and Models section so as to elucidate the problem statement.,1218938,-1,8093
"No implementation plans are proposed, but the design is satisfactory for the user to understand what needs to be done. ",1219148,1,8093
I appreciate the thought of using Delegation pattern. More details on this would have been helpful. Also why was delegation pattern selected in particular? ,1219183,1,8093
It's good.,1217697,-1,8093
The design is sound with appropriate principles and patterns.,1220664,-1,8093
the team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made. the design looks good and easy to implement. great work done !,1219760,-1,8093
"Yes, from a perspective of an outsider, the design seems to be simple enough, easy to understand, and efficient to implement.",1219716,-1,8093
"The design isn't great (as mentioned in the documentation) due to code duplication, but I agree that it may be the easiest way to start - hopefully a better solution can be found in the future to improve DRYness.",1220224,1,8093
"In general, the problem seems to be easy. but design states that  it involves whole new MVC setup which could translate to difficult implementation",1220811,1,8093
"Yes, the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the review section. ",1218939,-1,8093
The team has taken enough efforts to make it as simple as possible to explain the design,1219149,-1,8093
"Yes, the design is simplified and also there is room for some thought that is explicitly stated such as --- not really following the DRY principle and the team is willing to work towards it which is really good.",1219184,1,8093
Some of the diagrams are quite complex to understand.,1217698,1,8093
The design document is easy to comprehend.Have explained in detail about the problem but not about the solution.,1220665,1,8093
the design appears to be simple and is derived from the existing modules /designs. The workflow is easy to understand.,1219761,-1,8093
Visualizations are great for helping to clarify system analysis and relations in this portion of the image. More images on the design and implementation would also be a great addition for further understanding.,1218955,1,8093
"The UML diagrams are supposedly the best part of the writeup. Gives a very lucid and engaging representation of the underlying architecture if the system. Also, clearly depicts the understanding of the problem by the team.",1219717,1,8093
"The visualizations help a bit alongside the descriptions, but aren't really useful for conveying information.",1220225,1,8093
"great visualization on existing expertiza system, I would love to see how the system is going to change after your implementation",1220812,-1,8093
"Yes, the diagrams are clear to show how the system works. But they, are not so lucid so as to show in the diagram how they are going to implement the changes in the system.   ",1218940,1,8093
The team has added enough diagrams to explain their design,1219150,-1,8093
The visuals are very helpful. More clear view of how delegation pattern is being used would have been appreciable.,1219185,1,8093
Most of the edge cases are identified,1217699,-1,8093
Add screenshots. UML diagrams are very helpful when viewers walk through the design.,1220666,-1,8093
the team has included the diagrams related to current system analysis and the workflow.  A workflow explains the current design and its similarity with the existing flow used for topics biding. The team could have included some UI mock ups as well to show the views for better understanding. ,1219762,1,8093
The section is included by the content is empty. Simply listing steps in how you plan to test for correctness of your model additional would work here.,1218956,1,8093
"Sadly, the author has still not made any test plans for the project. The writeup has indeed improvised on the UML part from the previous submission, but the testing and implementation part of the writeup is still missing.",1219718,1,8093
No test plan is present still.,1220226,1,8093
No test plan is included.,1219351,1,8093
"No, it does not since the approach is to have a new model with delegation I strongly recommend team to add test cases that ensure systems functionalities are working as it is",1220813,1,8093
"No, their testing, implementation and challenges section is incomplete. Even though they given minuscule hints of the solutions and how they would try to check if at all. No sure way of testing it is given at all.",1218941,1,8093
No Test Plan is included.,1219151,1,8093
The doc is very well outlined but the team must have invested some amount in test cases. It would be really helpful to see how the new controller be tested and how the chosen pattern is able to help in the desired functionality.,1219186,1,8093
Not available.,1217700,1,8093
No test plans,1220667,1,8093
the team has included the test plan design in the documentation. The manual and automated test scenarios are currently missing from the document.,1219763,1,8093
"Yes, the authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system. Document is simple, succinct and easy to understand. Great use of flow charts, uml diagrams and mockups to visually represent the information is done. ",1219531,-1,8062
"The document provided by the team is very detailed and includes all the requirements which are suggested by the Change Request. However, the team may change tone of the document as it is instructive  right now which seems like the change request description itself. The team might also add a wiki link for this document so that it could be included in the expertiza links of existing and ongoing changes and would be more reachable to a wider audience.",1220779,1,8062
 Yes the author has provided a sufficient explanation of what changes needs to be done to the system by giving flow diagrams and screenshots about what changes they are going to incorporate in their system,1220438,-1,8062
Team has added all the diagrams and screenshots. The document is well explained and looks complete.,1220403,-1,8062
"Yes, their explanations are adequately explained the changes.",1220638,-1,8062
1) The authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system. 2) They also have given the files to be modified/added for each change.  ,1220006,-1,8062
I think that the authors have done a really good job of explaining and covering all the changes to be made. Overall this is the best document i have seen so far.,1218778,-1,8062
The authors have explained all the changes to be made very clearly and concisely. Each change is supplemented with sufficient diagrams and mock-ups so as to make the final task of visualization easier.,1218917,-1,8062
Yes the authors have tried to explain what changes are required and what they plan to do however I feel that exact changes that they might be doing are missing. They could have listed most files that will need modification and if necessary new files that will be changed,1219971,1,8062
"Yes, one of the best design docs of project 4!",1219946,-1,8062
"The document was very well written previously too, and they have improved it with diagrams and test. Nice work.",1219192,-1,8062
The authors have considerably improved on the document. UML diagrams as requested have been added.,1220804,-1,8062
The team has adequately explained all of the changes required for segregation including the exact reports and functions to be removed out of review_mapping_controller.rb along with the design pattern to be followed(strategy in this case).,1218773,-1,8112
"Yes. Since the previous round of reviews, I can see significant and positive progress.",1220493,-1,8112
Well done adding a lot of detail since your last submission.,1220067,-1,8112
The document explains the problem and the approach the team is planning to take clearly.,1219976,-1,8112
The explanations are good and the project goals are easily readable.,1220289,-1,8112
" Refactor the report_formatter_helper into a reports_controller, where the reports_controller implements a Strategy pattern to help it figure out how it should handle a given report. If that is correct, then yes, their explanation is great!",1219082,-1,8112
"Yes, the design follows appropriate principles and patterns. suggestions: not required.",1219532,-1,8062
" As the project is based upon making changes to the UI of the system , thus there is no such specific pattern being followed however the design that they have made available in the form of screenshots appear very much inclined with the functionalities that they need to implement .",1220439,-1,8062
Design is good,1220404,-1,8062
"Yes, their design is very sound, and principles and patterns are used appropriately.",1220639,-1,8062
The project involves refactoring of the review mappings controller and the authors have proposed a clear action plan. They have added a b=very detailed testing plan and also a detailed UML diagram. The authors have updated their UML diagram and also updated their testing plan after the first submission.,1220852,-1,8112
"1) The design appears to be sound. 2) Also follows proper design principles eg: for making changes to nomination and review questions, inheritance is used (inheriting methods from questions parent class)",1220007,-1,8062
"The authors have done a very good job at writing the design document. Their requirements and proposed solutions are properly aligned, and their approach takes all the factors into consideration, viz. Listing the major areas that need refactoring, Changing the code, modifying the UI, making sure that the refactoring does not affect the existing functionalities.  They have explained each of these phases with ample explanation.",1219679,-1,8112
The design seems to be appropriate and sound. It follows appropriate principles.,1220559,-1,8062
"Yes, the design appears to be very sound and follows all the principles that I know. I loved the format of the documentation as well.",1218779,-1,8062
" The design seems to be sound. There are a lot of mention of which files will be modified however, as I said in the previous round, there is no mention of the layout of the existing database or if the changes they will make currently will change the database. Suggestion: Team could mention what tables are present in the database of the Bacui project. I believe this will be really helpful since most of the reviewers are working on Expertiza projects and have no knowledge of Bacui projects. At the very least the team could mention which tables the project will be interacting with along with their structure.",1218918,1,8062
They have explained very well,1219486,-1,8062
The document enlisted the crucial aspects of the project in the first stage. The team has made improvements in this stage by including a test plan section that lists the set of test cases to deal with the retrieval issue and plan on including a new controller for the next stages. ,1220383,-1,8112
The team has adequately explained all of the changes required for segregation including the exact reports and functions to be removed out of review_mapping_controller.rb along with the design pattern to be followed(strategy in this case).,1218773,-1,8122
Yes the design follows simple rails concepts and is pretty straightforward. I would like to see if the team uses existing gems available to speed up implementation and re use.   ,1219972,-1,8062
"Yes, looks clean. Any design patterns used????",1219947,-1,8062
"Yes. Since the previous round of reviews, I can see significant and positive progress.",1220493,-1,8122
"   Yes, the team has covered the high-level implementation changes to be made to the system. We get the gist of the files that might be changed and what is end goal to be achieved. Though, its not very clear what is the change to be made under Separation of concerns section, which could have been explained better.           ",1218967,1,8112
"Yes, the design appears to be sound and well made. ",1219193,-1,8062
"Yes, the plan is clear and easy to read.",1218738,-1,8112
Well done adding a lot of detail since your last submission.,1220067,-1,8122
Have Updated the test plan.Good job!,1218763,-1,8112
"Yes, the design appears to be sound. There could be some rearrangement in the mock-up layout, e.g. text box for email address and 'Add' button could have the same horizontal alignment for a better user interface.",1220805,-1,8062
The document explains the problem and the approach the team is planning to take clearly.,1219976,-1,8122
The design looks clear and complete and is using a strategy pattern for implementation.,1218774,-1,8112
The design seems to be very simple. I think the team has avoided unnecessary complications and are doing minimal changes to existing system to solve issues given to them.,1219533,-1,8062
The explanations are good and the project goals are easily readable.,1220289,-1,8122
The design approach seems justified and inline with the functionalities required to be implemented. They have mentioned step wise details for all the changes they are going to take. Done a good job. No rework required.,1220781,-1,8062
"They have used the design patterns well, and made a good choice in explaining the class hierarchy with the class diagram (however, I'm not quite sure whether it's right to call the diagram as a UML diagram)",1220494,-1,8112
design looks well thought out.,1219977,-1,8112
" Refactor the report_formatter_helper into a reports_controller, where the reports_controller implements a Strategy pattern to help it figure out how it should handle a given report. If that is correct, then yes, their explanation is great!",1219082,-1,8122
" Yes the design is presented in a much simpler form which gives a very clear picture of how the changes are going to be implemented and which functionalities would be witnessing the changes , also as they have provide the screenshots it enhances the understanding about the project more.",1220440,-1,8062
Good design principles are being used for this project.,1220290,-1,8112
"Yes, their design is simple and clear enough to read and understand.",1220640,-1,8062
Refactor functionality from a Controller helper into its own Controller where that Controller will implement the Strategy pattern. It seems sounds to me!,1219083,-1,8112
The project involves refactoring of the review mappings controller and the authors have proposed a clear action plan. They have added a b=very detailed testing plan and also a detailed UML diagram. The authors have updated their UML diagram and also updated their testing plan after the first submission.,1220852,-1,8122
1) The design is simple and well modularized. 2) Each method is implementing only one task as it should.,1220008,-1,8062
the proposed refactoring changes seem to follow good ruby principles and also looks DRY.  They haven' t mentioned any pattern as such. But overall the design document looks neat and very well written.,1220853,1,8112
The design does appear to be as simple as possible. The team have not unnecessarily complicated the project.,1220560,-1,8062
"Yes, the design is pretty simple and to the point. The design proposed is very clear and talk why each change is necessary.",1218780,-1,8062
 The design is straightforward and as simple as possible. The team has thought this project out very clearly and laid the same in the form of flowcharts and mock-ups. This has greatly reduced the complexity of the project and helped decrease the chances of clutter and confusion.,1218919,-1,8062
"The authors have done a very good job at writing the design document. Their requirements and proposed solutions are properly aligned, and their approach takes all the factors into consideration, viz. Listing the major areas that need refactoring, Changing the code, modifying the UI, making sure that the refactoring does not affect the existing functionalities.  They have explained each of these phases with ample explanation.",1219679,-1,8122
"The authors have understood the requirements of each report generation clearly. They have converted report generation into a single step by providing a drop-down menu for 8 reports. For this, they have used generateReport() method. The design uses a strategy pattern to generate a particular type of report. The sub classes (strategy classes) use only required subset of class variables, and it seems as an efficient design. The strategy pattern is a good example of DRY principle.",1219680,-1,8112
"Yes, adequate amount of details present",1219487,-1,8062
The design follows the apt principles and patterns in that the refactored version is planned to be implemented using the Strategy pattern by working on the eight different report categories.,1220384,-1,8112
"Yes the design looks simple. The use of mock up screens is good and greatly helps understand the flow that has been proposed. Good work! How ever in one of the flow charts the check for ""Is Admin"" does not show/label  ""Y"" or ""N"" path",1219973,1,8062
"Yes, the design principles incorporated is quite impressive. They have thought through the best way to accommodate the changes and wrap it up as a good design.     ",1218968,-1,8112
Yes!  The requirements are simple and the design plan clearly explains all the points.,1219948,-1,8062
The document enlisted the crucial aspects of the project in the first stage. The team has made improvements in this stage by including a test plan section that lists the set of test cases to deal with the retrieval issue and plan on including a new controller for the next stages. ,1220383,-1,8122
"Yes, the design is appropriate. It would be better if the authors list the patterns they are going to use.",1218739,1,8112
"yes, design appears to be very simple.",1219194,-1,8062
Yes have followed all SE practices in design document.,1218764,-1,8112
"Yes, the design is quite simple.",1220806,-1,8062
"Great use of UML diagrams, flowcharts and mock-ups by the team to clearly explain the flow of their work. It is easy to understand the flow and how the end product will look like.",1219534,-1,8062
The design is pretty straightforward and I am able to get a complete idea of what changes the team intend to make.,1218775,-1,8112
Yes..,1220495,-1,8112
They team has done awesome work in representing every detail possible in the flow diagrams. They have created UML diagrams which depicts the flow of the admin and students along with other actors. As mentioned earlier they have also represented the admin flow diagram and instructor flow diagram through the flow chart which makes it very easy for end user to understand the workflow of the requirements in the expertiza system.,1220782,-1,8062
 Yes the visualization is pretty clear and good.,1220441,-1,8062
"   Yes, the team has covered the high-level implementation changes to be made to the system. We get the gist of the files that might be changed and what is end goal to be achieved. Though, its not very clear what is the change to be made under Separation of concerns section, which could have been explained better.           ",1218967,1,8122
Using the report interface to assist with specialization was good,1220069,-1,8112
Proper use of UML to explain the use cases and flow charts to explain the workflow has been done. The plan is complete.,1220406,-1,8062
"Yes, their visualization is good. They are clear and well described the changes.",1220641,-1,8062
"Yes, the plan is clear and easy to read.",1218738,-1,8122
Using a strategy pattern to solve this problem is one of the simplest approach according to me and team has selected the same thing. Only thing i would suggest the team is to be carefull when separating the classes as it might have some un-intended side affect.,1219978,-1,8112
Have Updated the test plan.Good job!,1218763,-1,8122
The proposed design is simple and no extra changes are being proposed.,1220291,-1,8112
"1) In the UML diagram the set of actions that the instructor can perform to add more than one question to nomination and textual type is not added. Also add the actions to modify the display sequence of existing questions. 2) In the instructor flow-chart, the flow for review questionnaire and to modify the display sequence of existing questions is missing.",1220009,-1,8062
" Yes, the design does sound like the simplest refactoring possible that can move the Review Mapping Controller closer to a single responsibility class.",1219084,-1,8112
The design looks clear and complete and is using a strategy pattern for implementation.,1218774,-1,8122
The design document is extremely clear. They have done a very good job in the design document.,1220854,-1,8112
" The design document includes flow charts, UML diagrams and screenshots which is really impressive as it made the document easier to understand. ",1220561,-1,8062
I loved the overall use of the visualizations which aids to the understanding of the whole doc. The formatting of the documentation makes it really easy to read and understand.,1218781,-1,8062
"They have used the design patterns well, and made a good choice in explaining the class hierarchy with the class diagram (however, I'm not quite sure whether it's right to call the diagram as a UML diagram)",1220494,1,8122
"The diagrams seems to be good for most of the part. One can understand the project by looking at the diagrams itself. However, in one of the instructor flow diagram, it's given that if the instructor's status is pending the instructor will set the limit to 10. That doesn't make sense. Why would the instructor himself/herself set the limit to 10. Isn't this the responsibility of the system itself to handle this or at the most the admin? Suggestions: Change the 'yes' branch of is pending? to loop 10 times or somehow indicate that pending instructors can add only 10 students to an assignment.",1218920,1,8062
"The design appears to be a bit complex, as it involves interactions with two controllers, viz. review_mapping_controller and report_controller. The changes should be checked thoroughly to not impact the existing methods of these controllers. Nevertheless, the design is complete in itself, and the authors have tried to keep it as modular and clear as possible. A very good job here!",1219681,1,8112
design looks well thought out.,1219977,-1,8122
Yes the presence of use case diagrams and flow charts explaining the work flow is good. It would be nice if there were more uml diagrams such as sequence so show various class interactions.  Presence of mockup screens is good. That helps in understanding what is being implemented. It would have been good if the authors put in more details about the validations that that propose in the system ,1219974,-1,8062
"The design document appears to be concise in it's representation. According to the task specified and proposals described, the design appears simple to be executed.",1220385,-1,8112
Good design principles are being used for this project.,1220290,-1,8122
"Class diagrams are missing. Class diagrams are missing. First flow diagram looks perfect. Second needs some modifications - the instructor login flow should not include a step to set the count limit to 10. This should have been done before only. You should add a step to perform a check to see if the total students count is crossing the allowed limit(10). If yes, then don't add this new student and show some proper error message to the user. If no, then add the student.",1219949,1,8062
"    Yes, the design is simple and straight-forward. In personal opinion, it could not have been simpler than this. Great work on design.",1218969,-1,8112
"Yes, the uml diagrams sufficiently provide visualization.",1219195,-1,8062
Refactor functionality from a Controller helper into its own Controller where that Controller will implement the Strategy pattern. It seems sounds to me!,1219083,-1,8122
"Yes, the plan seems simple and feasible.",1218740,-1,8112
Easy to comprehend,1218765,-1,8112
The authors have added UML diagrams as requested in the previous review and it has made a lot of difference. The explanation is much clearer now.,1220807,-1,8062
The team has done a good job with the UML diagram. They have also added details to the class diagram as was suggested in the last review,1218776,-1,8112
Test plan outlines the functionalities that the team will test and it seems sufficient to test the changes.,1219535,-1,8062
the proposed refactoring changes seem to follow good ruby principles and also looks DRY.  They haven' t mentioned any pattern as such. But overall the design document looks neat and very well written.,1220853,-1,8122
They team has done tremendous job in following the test driven approach for the project implementation. They have already included the tests they are writing for the functionality implementation. They have covered the exhaustive scenarios  for the project in their test. Their test plan is highly appreciative.,1220783,-1,8062
"The mock UIs are well thought of and make navigation easier. A couple of suggestions: - can add another mock UI showing the drop down. - Some types of reports may not exist. If the drop down options are hard-coded, selecting an option might lead to a page with no content (this might be an existing issue I suspect). For every option, you could query for existence of at least one record before putting that option in the drop down.",1220496,1,8112
Excellent diagrams and UI mock ups!,1220070,-1,8112
 The test plan is quite good as it covers all the test cases in the form of 11 test cases which test all the functionalities for the admin and the instructor role. It also considers the negative test cases like throwing an exception when the pending instructor tries to add more then 10 students to his/her course.,1220442,-1,8062
The UML and flow Charts used by the teams are good but can be made more clear and appealing,1219979,1,8112
"The authors have understood the requirements of each report generation clearly. They have converted report generation into a single step by providing a drop-down menu for 8 reports. For this, they have used generateReport() method. The design uses a strategy pattern to generate a particular type of report. The sub classes (strategy classes) use only required subset of class variables, and it seems as an efficient design. The strategy pattern is a good example of DRY principle.",1219680,-1,8122
Tests can be made more exhaustive. For now it looks like only the view will be tested but controller should be tested as well.,1220407,1,8062
"The UML diagram is good, but the diagram in the test plan is not very helpful; I'd suggest either another UML-ish diagram or just a bulleted list of the features from the Report Controller.",1220292,1,8112
"Yes, they include the test plan.",1220642,-1,8062
 Their diagrams are Supreme. The diagram of how they plan to implement the Strategy pattern significantly helped to cement my comprehension of what they plan to do.,1219085,-1,8112
1) The test cases cover all of the functionalities that they are going to implement.,1220010,-1,8062
No visualizations required for this project.,1220855,-1,8112
The design follows the apt principles and patterns in that the refactored version is planned to be implemented using the Strategy pattern by working on the eight different report categories.,1220384,-1,8122
"Yes, the document includes a test plan. There was no test plan present in the previous version of the design document but the team included the test plan in the second round. The test plan is clear and seems like it would really test the functionalities.",1220562,-1,8062
"The visualization aids used are class diagram for the strategy pattern, use-cases to explain the test plan. The class diagram is very useful to illustrate the approach used by the team, and it succeeds in explaining. They have made changes according to the suggestion provided in the previous review. A sequence diagram will help understand the flow of the methods from one controller to the other, as the design suggests so.",1219682,1,8112
The test plan has been written in a very good way following the great quality of documentation till the end. It covers all the edge cases and scenarios.,1218782,-1,8062
"Yes, the design principles incorporated is quite impressive. They have thought through the best way to accommodate the changes and wrap it up as a good design.     ",1218968,-1,8122
The test plans are excellent. The best I have seen so far.It has accurately taken all test cases into consideration and described the layout of the final test in the form of a pseudo code. Well Done on the test plan!!,1218921,-1,8062
"Yes, the design is appropriate. It would be better if the authors list the patterns they are going to use.",1218739,1,8122
"Yes, test plans are included",1219489,-1,8062
"From the previous stage, the team has added the Use Case Diagram that efficiently describes the actors involved in the process. Also, since a new controller is proposed it was essential to identify the role of the instructor.",1220386,1,8112
Yes have followed all SE practices in design document.,1218764,-1,8122
" Yes, they have improved the UML diagram from last round and its a standard class UML diagram. Its very self-explanatory. Though the diagram under test plan should be clearer. Also, there could have been a sample report generated for reference.",1218970,1,8112
I would the test section incomplete. The authors have mentioned about 11 test cases thats all. I think that is not at all sufficient. Also missing are unit tests if any and UI tests if any.  I would have liked mention of more test cases both automated as well as UI tests that will ensure basic sanity to the system,1219975,1,8062
The design is pretty straightforward and I am able to get a complete idea of what changes the team intend to make.,1218775,-1,8122

"Yes, the team has added a test plan after the first review. The test plan seems to cover the major portion of the changes planned.",1218777,-1,8112
The team is following a Test Driven Development approach. They have defined the test cases that need to be tested after the implementation. It seems to completely test the feature.,1220808,-1,8062
"Tests are well covered. However, I don't see how the nicely constructed use case diagram is appropriate to be placed in the ""Test Plan"" section.",1220497,1,8112

"The test plan covers all the reports and their creation, as well as data to be rendered using the new button added. You can try adding edge test cases, i.e. the code should not break if data is empty for a report. They have not yet posted the complete plan of testing, and plan to update as per the progress.

diagram is added. ,1220466,-1,8031
No visulization is necessary for this project,1217191,-1,8031
"Yes, the team has made a very good testing plan, consisting of functional testing, which covers almost all of the use cases which have been added/modified. However, the author could have added code snippets of the same, instead of just discussing the proposed plan.",1219778,1,8031

"I suggest the testing plan be improved. In place of giving steps on how a reviewer should test the project, the team should instead list how they wish to write tests for the functionality added. The rspec could be something like expect(page).to have_content(sorted)",1219915,1,8031
"  The test plan has covered test cases for testing functionalities of sorting submissions table and review mappings per field. They can also include test plan for the edge cases of the system, like the code should not break when the submissions table is empty and show should probably display a flash message saying ""no entries to be sorted!"". In this way, try to add a few negative testing to improve your coverage. This will make your code more rigid.",1219555,1,8031
"The test plan is present. It consists of a set of functional tests described for each of the five views. I would suggest elaborating on the technical side of tests, for example specifying which spec files will be modified or whether or not the project will utilize RSpec.

"The test plan is complete and covers all intended functionalities. They have also provided all necessary steps to test the functionality. Good documentation on test plan. As client-side changes using script is added, a latency test to verify system is not slow in responding to sorting can be included.",1218986,1,8031
the test plan is thorough. ,1220467,-1,8031

Very simple and clear.,1217408,-1,8070
The team has done tremendous job in adding visualization aids. They have added application flow diagrams and visualized images. They have also included screenshots to explain the code functionality implementation of enabling self reviews and score pages. This makes the document descriptive and very easy to read and understand.  ,1220900,-1,8070
Self explanatory visual changes have been added. All the changes are described via the visual aids.,1219604,-1,8070

The team has done tremendous job in the test plan they have already implemented the test cases and given the path to run it.,1220901,-1,8070
The provided tests are in depth and will test the changes made thoroughly.,1219605,-1,8070
They have pretty good test plan as there is no code yet.,1217241,-1,8070
"This is a mozilla project and I am not sure what are the testing requirements and depth to be covered, as it is not mentioned in the document. But the steps mentioned do suggest that basic testing id done",1220452,-1,8070
"Yes, the design includes a test plan. I think the tests can be more descriptive, including 'what' is being tested and in 'which scenario' the test is being implemented.",1220181,1,8070
It included a proper test plan. There was no test plan included in the previous version of the design document but authors have added it in the second round which made the design document complete.,1220577,-1,8070
the design does include test plan and plans to test the functionalities ,1219747,-1,8070
I feel the test plan should be more descriptive while also covering a few edge cases.,1219895,1,8070
"The test plan doesn't seem to explain how the team intends to test their new implementation, it simply gives directions for running tests.",1219575,1,8070
"They have Test plan, but I don't think they include test in it, they just put some examples about how to run their code.  ",1217410,1,8070
Yes they have,1220192,-1,8055
explained details about their solution and what will be changed after their implementation.,1220588,-1,8055
"Yes, changes to be made are clearly explained",1219152,-1,8055
"The changes to be made to improve the existing system have been adequately explained in the design document. The filters by which the data needs to be curated have also been stated. However, it would be better if they started by giving a short description of the problem statement and then going into specifics.",1219664,1,8055
They have explained in detail about the proposed changes with individual diagrams for each case. It is very thorough in explanation,1219546,-1,8055
"Great documentation. Tbh, the best i have seen yet.  ",1219026,-1,8055
They have documented it in a very rehearsed manner,1219490,-1,8055
"The design document is really well written. It clearly describes what needs to be done, how it needs to be done and what code changes need to be made. The files and tables affected are clearly listed.",1219866,-1,8055
The authors have prepared the design document quite well.,1219207,-1,8055
The documentation looks great as a high-level design document. Low-level technical details(code level) should also be covered.,1219961,1,8055
The author has explained extensively about the changes to be made to the system.,1217242,-1,8055
"Yes, the problem definition and the proposed solution are pretty clear. They also provide some diagrams to explain their project which is helpful.",1218728,-1,8055
Their introduction and problem definition are clearly enough to explained the changes.,1217411,-1,8055
"With er diagram and database details, the design looks good. ",1220589,-1,8055
The design follows appropriate principles and patterns as required,1219153,-1,8055
"The project consists of making a search function to select specific users, assignments etc using some criteria. So they're creating a search functionality for individual models.",1219665,-1,8055
Yes the proposed changes make only required additions.,1219547,-1,8055
Yes it follows appropriate principles. ,1219027,-1,8055
The design appears to be sound. It is really well structured. It is easy to follow. It clearly states the changes to be made and the files affected by these changes.,1219867,-1,8055
The design appears to be sound and clearly indicates the proposed code changes.,1219208,-1,8055
"Design approaches are clearly explained (yes, the 2nd approach is the correct approach). Any design patterns used???",1219962,1,8055
"The design follows appropriate principles, but no design patterns have been used.",1217243,1,8055
"Yes, the design is appropriate.",1218729,-1,8055
"Yes, they provide solution for different problem situations.",1217412,-1,8055
Yes it is fairly simple,1220194,-1,8055
"no complex design, only few places need to add functionalities, and they all very similar.",1220590,1,8055
"The design is simple, although the ER diagram takes a little time to decipher since it is quite big",1219154,1,8055
"Yes, the approach described in the design document is easy enough to understand. They have also backed their decision to go with the second approach with appropriate reasoning.",1219666,-1,8055
The design is simple and quite comprehensive covering lots of methods of searching.,1219548,-1,8055
YEs based on the proposed solution it appears to be simple as possible.,1219028,-1,8055
The design document appears really easy to follow. A person who is new to the project can get the summary of what is happening just by reading and going through the design document.,1219868,-1,8055
The design appears to be simple. However any code modifications is not mentioned yet as work project might not have started so far. it would be nice if a list of files to be modified were added.,1219209,1,8055
The design has been explained in a simple way. The team has explained the design using use cases which is easy to comprehend.,1217244,-1,8055
"Yes, the design is simple and feasible.",1218730,-1,8055
"Yes, clear and simple.",1217413,-1,8055
"Yes, easy to understand.",1219963,-1,8055
They have used apt visual aid like UML diagrams and screen shots,1220195,-1,8055
"No class diagram, but there is er diagram and tables for database, it looks a little complex, but give the idea of what is involving. ",1220591,1,8055
Necessary diagrams are included.,1219155,-1,8055
The team has communicated their design clearly via use-case diagram and a class diagram with a description of various database tables involved.,1219667,-1,8055
Excellent use of visualizations. They already had an overall flow chart and this time additional tables and UML has been added. Best of what I've seen.,1219549,-1,8055
"Yes they do explain everything. The er diagram, use case diagram, relevant tables explain everything.",1219029,-1,8055
The diagrams seems to go out of the boundary of the pae.,1219493,-1,8055
The project has great visualization. A lot of UML diagrams have been included which makes the understanding the project easier. The UML diagrams also clarifies what work is to be done.,1219869,-1,8055
"The pictures clearly demonstrate the changes being made to the system, although it is apparent where the changes would be visible. it would be nice if a image was posted having the current expertiza deployement to show where the changes would be visible",1219210,1,8055
Not enough! Add use case diagrams and flow diagrams.,1219964,1,8055
The team has described changes using use case and ER diagrams to clearly explain the system.,1217245,-1,8055
The authors add more diagrams to help to explain the change they are going to make. The relevant tables are really helpful.,1218731,-1,8055
"They use ER diagram to describe the changes, but I think it is not very intuitive for me to understand their task.",1217414,1,8055
test plans walk through necessary functionalities.,1220592,-1,8055
"Yes, a good test plan is also included",1219156,-1,8055
The test cases described will cover the functionalities described given that they write multiples tests with the same structure as described for all search criteria. ,1219668,-1,8055
A concrete test plan is also added and it has both UI and automated test details.,1219550,-1,8055
Yes this is done very well.,1219030,-1,8055
"They include a very described test plan. It has everything proper. What framework, what tests all this information is well included. They clearly specify what they aim to test.",1219870,-1,8055
The test plan is pretty good and it has both UI tests and automated tests. ,1219211,-1,8055
Manual test plans as of now! The team is planning to add Rspecs after implementation.,1219965,-1,8055
The test plan is designed efficiently. They have described the UI tests and automated tests which cover most of the cases. ,1217246,-1,8055
"Two types of testing are listed, and the authors list all the cases they need to test.",1218732,-1,8055
"They have test plan section, but too few test cases.",1217415,1,8055
"The author has excellently explained about the changes that they would be making by providing the design diagram and the screenshot of the the changes that they have incorporated .Also they have mentioned about their choice of tool which is google chart and why do they prefer , so overall a good explanation",1220478,-1,8106
Changes that's needs to be made has been explained correctly.,1220543,-1,8106
"Yes, their doc has adequately explained the changes.",1220658,-1,8106
The team have a well written design document and and the authors have explained the proposed changes well. The authors have also listed each file they are going to be changed.,1220673,-1,8106
"yes, the team has well explained the changes that they are going to make. Last time it was a bit confusing but this time because of the help of the diagrams and mock UI screen, the solution seems clear now.",1219722,-1,8106
The authors have explained the changes made to the system. The design flow greatly helps to understand the flow of the system.,1220259,-1,8106
The authors have described what all changes they plan to do and where they plan to do it. Compared to the previous version of the design document they have now included what tools and framework they plan to work on. The design document looks complete and understandable now.,1219814,-1,8106
They will be changing mostly html and erb code to create a visual interface that delivers information to instructors more effectively.,1219596,-1,8106
The proposed changes have been explained in a simple manner.,1219097,-1,8106
"The document adequately describes the project description and proposals made. The proposed change of generating a single or single bar chart graph based on the categories selected to display the chart, can be efficiently made to the system.",1220453,-1,8106
They have improved the document to provide a better description of changes to be made to the system.,1219227,-1,8106
Yes the design is sound and gives a proper explanation about how their implementation would behave.,1220479,-1,8106
Design seems correct.,1220544,-1,8106
"Yes, their design is clear and sound, and the principles and patterns are well used.",1220659,-1,8106
The design documents is well explained. the authors haven't mentioned any design pattern as such. The authors have clearly stated the proposed changes though. they could have added uml and crc cards.,1220674,1,8106
yeah their design seems to be sound and neat.,1219723,-1,8106
System is well defined ,1220260,-1,8106
"The document is really descriptive about what work needs to be done. However, I would suggest them to properly structure the document. One finds it really difficult to understand the flow of the document.",1219815,1,8106
The design document is good and I don't think any design pattern needs to be followed as very few changes are being made. ,1219098,-1,8106
"The design makes use of the Google charts tool to generate visual charts for specific criteria set. Based on the design flow, it appears that the functionality can be consistently performed to generate the visual graph for the instructor.",1220454,-1,8106
"Yes, the design appears to be sound and uses appropriate design principles.",1219228,-1,8106
Yes the design is pretty simple and inclusion of screenshot enhances the clarity of what the team has achieved in terms of the required changes. ,1220480,-1,8106
Design is simple and easy to understand.,1220545,-1,8106
"Yes, the design is simple and easy to understand. I can easily know what they will do through their doc.",1220660,-1,8106
The design appears to be very simple and well written. They have explained the use case diagram very well. also they have added visualizations.,1220675,-1,8106
"yes, the design is simple and easy to understand ",1219724,-1,8106
The team is using external tools to do the work and its clear and easy,1220261,-1,8106
"The document is really simple to understand once you get to understand the flow. However, initially it appears to be difficult.",1219816,1,8106
Using google charts is a good idea.,1219598,-1,8106
"Actual project work has not been started yet, so code modifications have not been mentioned yet. But the files to be changed seem appropriate for the project objective.",1219099,1,8106
"From the reasons provided for choosing the Google charts tool, and it's effectiveness, it can be integrated into the system functionality easily making the design simpler to be executed.",1220455,-1,8106
"Yes, design involves google charts API and seems very simple.",1219229,-1,8106
Yes the design flow and the screenshots very clearly describes the changes made to the system.,1220481,-1,8106
Flow diagram explains the flow correctly.,1220546,-1,8106
"Yes, they have used visualization to help people understand their design.",1220661,-1,8106
The bar charts have been added to the design report. The visualizations have been added to views also and the screen shots have been added too. The only thing that I would like to add is that the bar charts could have been more descriptive. As in they could have added details for  x label and y label and also put legend. this will aid the user in quickly understanding what the chart is conveying.  ,1220676,-1,8106
They have worked on their weak point. Earlier their solution does not seem cogent but I would say now they have made good progress.,1219725,-1,8106
The sample data visualizations is good. The way they have given visualizations for sample data is nice. easier to understand and good.,1220262,-1,8106
"The document does include a flowchart which shows the flow of changes. However, an UML diagram would have made the document more understandable and easy to follow.",1219817,-1,8106
The team already has mockups for their design.,1219599,-1,8106
"The visualization is great, the screenshots clearly indicate the proposed output of the project.",1219100,-1,8106
The team has not included any additional diagrams apart from the flow diagram provided in the first stage. The flow diagram effectively describes the sequence of actions that need to be taken so that the instructor can view the bar graph visual representation for the selected criteria set.,1220456,-1,8106
Really good visualization provided.,1219230,-1,8106
Functionality features test has been included but plan for RSpec tests is yet to be included.,1220547,1,8106
"Yes, they did include the test plan, but it's not enough, if just including files.",1220662,1,8106
The project does not have any testing involved as such. But the authors have added a testing plan.,1220677,1,8106
"According to the team ""The specification of the project does not require us to use automated tests"" but they plan to test the modified ruby code or the new features using the RSpec testing framework. Overall, the test  plan sounds good ",1219726,-1,8106
No tests are required for the project as stated,1220263,-1,8106
"The test plan section is included, however, only the framework to be used is discussed. I would suggest them to include a little more brief description about what test cases they plan to include and work on.",1219818,1,8106
This team did not require any tests.,1219600,-1,8106
The design document does not include a test plan as testing requirement is very minimal since most changes are in view.,1219101,-1,8106
"The test plan section specifies that it does not require performing any automated tests. However, since the new functionality of adding a visual diagram, the team would modified ruby code for the functions added to the grades_controller.",1220457,-1,8106
"They have mentioned that they will be using Rspec framework, but have not given what tests they will be implementing and hence can not comment if tests will be shallow or not. ",1219231,1,8106
Authors have explained the changes that needs to be made clearly.,1220513,-1,8087
The authors have described the changes to be made. However these are very abstract and require some technical depth,1220887,1,8087
The changes necessary are explicitly outlined. though more description as to why certain files need to be modified would be nice to have.,1220207,1,8087
"As said in the previous review, though the UI mockup explains the functionalities, it could have been more legible.",1219807,1,8042
Test plan is discussed in the write up. It could have been supported with some use-cases.,1219808,1,8042
"In the problem statement section, the first author should be reviewers I think.",1219561,1,8042
"Yes the design is sound and appeopriate. However, it may be better to implement more code level design.",1219562,-1,8042
Simple and clear. Easy to understand.,1219563,-1,8042
"It gives a high-level design picture and two scratches of UI, which are all good and understandable.",1219564,-1,8042
"The test plan is completed. Just one suggestion that it can be more specific. For example, it may include some real test cases.",1219565,-1,8042
"Yes, have included the flow of the process in the second round of interview",1220421,-1,8042
1) The document clearly mentions the changes to be made to the existing system and requirements that need to be delivered. 2) Also mentions the changes to be made to the UI. 3) The files to be added/modified are also mentioned.,1220026,-1,8042
1) Follows appropriate design principles and patterns.,1220027,-1,8042
"1) Yes, the design appears to be simple.",1220028,-1,8042
1) Create class diagram and UML diagram outlining the set of actions that the reviewer and the author can perform.,1220029,1,8042
1) Document includes test plan. 2) However can include more test cases.,1220030,-1,8042
Content is good and well written from the last review I was expecting little more in depth deatails on the implementation side . I see no edits after Nov 14 except for the new image,1220774,1,8042
"yes, there is no mention of design pattern yet but overall design appear very clear to me",1220775,-1,8042
mockup diagrams really make it easy to understand  ,1220776,-1,8042
"great work in high level test plan , it is very easy to understand and it is one of the strong point of this documentnt",1220778,-1,8042
"overall team has done good work on visualization, hope to see the actual images of expertiza by the end of the project",1220777,-1,8042
Authors have explained the changes that needs to be made clearly.,1220513,-1,8042
Design seems good.,1220514,-1,8042
Design seems simple and correct.,1220515,-1,8042
Diagram included in the implementation plan is confusing. A better way would have been to include a diagram to indicate the step by step flow.,1220516,1,8042
Test plan does not contain edge cases or the step by step procedure for performing test.,1220517,1,8042
The changes necessary are explicitly outlined. though more description as to why certain files need to be modified would be nice to have.,1220207,-1,8042
The proposed changes match existing expertiza guidelines well.,1220208,-1,8042
The plan of work seems to be quite simple. ,1220209,-1,8042
"The UI mockups are good. I'm not entirely sure that the UML diagram is effective, perhaps a better diagram style would work better.",1220210,1,8042
Several tests are listed and described. I would suggest adding more details for each test as there is some vagueness as to what each described action entails. ,1220211,1,8042
The authors have described the changes to be made. However these are very abstract and require some technical depth,1220887,1,8042
 The design appears to be well made. However due to lack of more detail I am unable to judge it correctly. What changes need to be made in the files is not mentioned.,1220888,1,8042
" Yes the design is simple, however, as stated above it is very succinct and abstract.  Only which files are going to be edited are written. What methods/interfaces will be modified is not mentioned.",1220889,1,8042
 The diagrams have been enlarged and are now visible. Good improvement. However I still feel that computer made mockups would have looked cleaner.,1220890,1,8042
 Yes the design includes a test plan in the end. This too is very abstract (about 5 lines total) and just states the use cases. Tip: use the 'it should' format or at least describe the simple manual testing that can be done.,1220891,1,8042
"Yes, very clearly writeup.",1219132,-1,8042
The explanation is good and helps get the point across,1219357,-1,8042
The design for the feature is simple and clear.,1219359,-1,8042
I see that they added an additional flow diagram that is further helping in the understanding,1219360,-1,8042
They have mentioned about possible tests required for the project.,1219361,-1,8042
"Well, they have mentioned what needs to be done, what changes have to be implemented.",1220373,-1,8042
It does appear to be sound and in sync with the DRY principles.,1220374,-1,8042
"Well, the design does look simple. It is not difficult to understand the principle.",1220375,-1,8042
"They have a UML diagram which pretty much does it job. I am not in favor of the UI mockups they have put. They could have used any software for the same, which would have made it legible.",1220376,1,8042
The test plan given is not concrete. Just mentions what should be done but no actual steps for them.,1220377,1,8042
Problem statement is too brief. Design should 'talk' about proposed solution. Too short.,1220182,1,8042
"UI mockups and UML diagrams are descriptive. However, more information should be conveyed to how to solve the problem",1220183,-1,8042
It's precise but some information missing.,1220184,1,8042
"Yes, diagrams are self-explanatory.",1220185,-1,8042
Test Plan too brief. Could add scenarios and description. ,1220186,1,8042
"The authors have made a really good attempt at explaining the changes to be made, however, I feel like few details could have been added to the previously done work and how they are going to improve it. ",1218783,1,8042
The design appears to be sound following all the appropriate principles and patterns. I liked the overall flow of the document.,1218784,-1,8042
The design looks to be simple and clear to me. It clearly states what files are going to be changed and as per my knowledge there is no redundant and unnecessary change.,1218785,-1,8042
i liked the visualizations used this time around. they have certainly improved from the last time. I liked the overall used of high and low level visualisations provided.,1218786,-1,8042
Even though few test cases have been provided I feel like it could have been more detailed with the steps involved in the testing.,1218787,-1,8042
"Yes, very clearly writeup.",1219132,-1,8087
"Well, they have mentioned what needs to be done, what changes have to be implemented.",1220373,-1,8087

 The diagrams have been enlarged and are now visible. Good improvement. However I still feel that computer made mockups would have looked cleaner.,1220890,1,8087
"Yes, have included the flow of the process in the second round of interview",1220421,-1,8087
"The UI mockups are good. I'm not entirely sure that the UML diagram is effective, perhaps a better diagram style would work better.",1220210,1,8087
"They have a UML diagram which pretty much does it job. I am not in favor of the UI mockups they have put. They could have used any software for the same, which would have made it legible.",1220376,1,8087
"overall team has done good work on visualization, hope to see the actual images of expertiza by the end of the project",1220777,-1,8087
1) Create class diagram and UML diagram outlining the set of actions that the reviewer and the author can perform.,1220029,1,8087
i liked the visualizations used this time around. they have certainly improved from the last time. I liked the overall used of high and low level visualisations provided.,1218786,-1,8087
I see that they added an additional flow diagram that is further helping in the understanding,1219360,-1,8087
"Yes, diagrams are self-explanatory.",1220185,-1,8087
"It gives a high-level design picture and two scratches of UI, which are all good and understandable.",1219564,-1,8087
Test plan is discussed in the write up. It could have been supported with some use-cases.,1219808,1,8087
Test plan does not contain edge cases or the step by step procedure for performing test.,1220517,1,8087
 Yes the design includes a test plan in the end. This too is very abstract (about 5 lines total) and just states the use cases. Tip: use the 'it should' format or at least describe the simple manual testing that can be done.,1220891,1,8087
Several tests are listed and described. I would suggest adding more details for each test as there is some vagueness as to what each described action entails. ,1220211,1,8087
The test plan given is not concrete. Just mentions what should be done but no actual steps for them.,1220377,1,8087
"great work in high level test plan , it is very easy to understand and it is one of the strong point of this documentnt",1220778,-1,8087
1) Document includes test plan. 2) However can include more test cases.,1220030,1,8087
Even though few test cases have been provided I feel like it could have been more detailed with the steps involved in the testing.,1218787,1,8087
They have mentioned about possible tests required for the project.,1219361,-1,8087
Test Plan too brief. Could add scenarios and description. ,1220186,1,8087
"The test plan is completed. Just one suggestion that it can be more specific. For example, it may include some real test cases.",1219565,1,8087
"The issues have been identified and documented clearly. However, a little more of explanation is required for the solutions proposed for issues 2 - 5. They seem to me at a very high level.",1220643,-1,8022
"Yes, the authors have nicely explained the changes to be made. This includes, the flow diagrams, UML diagrams and many of the screenshots. Good work team. Suggestion: Could include screenshots, if any, of the test plans implemented.",1219906,1,8022
"The author has very well given a background of the system and the problem, which forms a lucid idea of the changes intended by the author in the system. However, the author has only given a very high level view of the changes to be incorporated in the system. There is not much of an explanation, nor an implementation.",1219727,1,8022
"Yes, they look well written and easy to follow with all the visual aids. ",1220628,-1,8022
Very well written document. Good job team.,1220324,-1,8022
"Yes, they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection. They have not only given proper UML diagrams and the like, but they are yet to implement the code and showcase in the ""UML Diagram for Review"" section.     ",1218857,1,8022
"The problems are described very nicely. When it comes to changes to be made, files to be modified are given. I feel more explanation needs to be given with respect to changes in these files for each problem stating why this file needs to be changed and what the impact will be.",1219886,1,8022
The doc is very well written. Its like a blueprint to the project. Really appreciate the team efforts!,1219212,1,8022
I understand what the team is supposed to do to the expertiza system.,1219591,-1,8022
Team have explained the Problem/Steps to Reproduce are really very clear. Solution part could have been explained better. Overall its a good work,1219991,1,8022
"The team has included all the details required to implement the given requirement. The wiki has complete details related to requirements , analysis of current designs and changes required to achieve the required functionality. overall great job !  The team did a great work in analyzing the issues and designing solutions for the issues. The UI mock ups are included for all the issues which makes the document very easy to understand.  ",1219784,1,8022
Drastic improvements have been made to design doc. ,1218768,-1,8022
"As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.   ",1220644,-1,8022
The design looks good. All the issues are stated and addressed nicely.,1219907,-1,8022
"Yes, the deisgn appears to be totally sound. The changes proposed are very standardized, and follows appropriate industry standards.",1219728,-1,8022
the design is sound with appropriate principles and patterns. ,1220629,-1,8022
Clearly explained with diagrams and UML diagrams.,1220325,-1,8022
"  The design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the use case diagram in which the users are student and instructor and the data base is where the actions are stored in the database and the retrieved from the same for the case of reviews information.  Also, they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the Application Flow section so as to elucidate the problem statement. ",1218858,-1,8022
"Since the project is aimed at fixing the issues, no design patterns need to be used.",1219213,-1,8022
The team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made. the design looks good and easy to implement. great work done !  ,1219785,-1,8022
Mostly yes. But the working flow could have been explained better with the flow diagrams.,1218769,1,8022
"Yes, simple straightforward solutions.",1220645,-1,8022
The design does not seem that complex. The team has clearly mentioned the issues and the way to go about it.  ,1219908,-1,8022
"Yes, the design is very simple, lucid and efficient.",1219729,-1,8022
"yes, only a few files are being modified. ",1220630,-1,8022
The design is simple. ,1220326,-1,8022
"Yes, the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the review section. ",1218859,-1,8022
The explanation of each of the issues in details is done very well but it does seem to be complicated unless files to be modified and solutions are read.,1219214,-1,8022
"It was weird that two of the bugs they were assigned don't exist, but that's not the team's fault.",1219593,-1,8022
The design appears to be simple and straightforward to implement. The team has also included all the changes that will be made to achieve the desired results.  Great Work !,1219786,-1,8022
The design document is easy to comprehend.Have explained in detail about the problem but not about the solution.,1218770,-1,8022
Great use of mock ups and UML diagrams. It makes understanding the issues easier. Looks like a great amount of thought has gone into making it. ,1220646,-1,8022
The visualization is great. All the flow diagrams and required screenshots are in place as required.,1219909,-1,8022
"The visualization is by far the best part of this writeup. Also, it's visualization is among the best I've reviewed till date. The author has put in a lot of efforts for the same. The diagrams make the architecture and the problem statement very simple to understand.",1219730,-1,8022
"A lots of visuals, very helpful when viewers walk through the design. ",1220631,-1,8022
Great work by the team on UML diagrams. ,1220327,-1,8022
"Yes, the diagrams are clear to show how the system works. They have even gone a step ahead to show how they have thought of resolving the problem at each and every step of the Expertiza review section and the message popups they receive for the same. ",1218860,-1,8022
The visuals used are excellent but it would have been nice to not overwhelm the reader.,1219215,1,8022
This team consistently uses great diagrams that add to their documentation's clarity significantly.,1219594,-1,8022
The team has included a lot of visual aids which complements the document making it a lot easier to understand.  Great work with the UI mockups / project design / UML diagrams.,1219787,-1,8022
Given UML diagram which are explaining the functionality appropriately but class diagram would have been better to explain the detail code level change ,1218771,1,8022
"Testing plan is not included. However, somewhat of an idea can be obtained from the steps to reproduce.",1220647,1,8022
There are some test plans in place and others will be done after the bugs are generated. Suggestions: It would have been great to have screenshots of the test plans.,1219910,1,8022
"The author has made a test plan, but it is ""reactive"" instead of ""proactive"". The test plan for the changes to be incorporated could be improved a bit further by further consideration about the usage scenario.",1219731,1,8022
"Make include more details for test plan, other than that, the wiki looks very good. ",1220632,1,8022
"As per the requirement document, test cases are not required.",1220328,-1,8022
"Yes, they have a working test plan in mind and also they have thought of the ways in which they are going to test the various edge cases for the various issues at hand.",1218861,-1,8022
Tests are given at a very high level and need to be described properly.,1219890,1,8022
The aspect of re-producing the issues are very clearly mentioned and hence tests are written briefly which can be easily understood.,1219216,-1,8022
The tests are really in depth for each issue the team will be fixing.,1219595,-1,8022
"The team has included the test plan design but the documentation is missing on the scenarios that will be tested after the implementation, How the team will be testing it , what are the automated test that will be created and also the manual test plan. How an end user can test the end-to- end requirements should also be a part of the design.",1219788,1,8022
Test plans are present but have not explained in detail. A brief description  of the use case with the test plan and RSpec would be perfect ,1218772,1,8022
"The team has very well explained the changes they are making in the project to achieve the functionality. However, they have not included any design explanation explicitly. They have not described the approach they have come with.

The authors have dived into the depths when explaining the changes. All of the changes are well defined and precise.,1219601,-1,8049
"Yes, they did.",1217237,-1,8049

Need more explanation of the work to be done by the team. ,1220349,1,8115
The team have thoroughly explained the changes that need to be made and how they intend to make those changes. The team could explain their test plan in more detail.,1219385,-1,8115
The additions made to the explanations were excellent. The detail of which changes affect which files is very good.,1220052,-1,8115

"Overall, the report was concise and fairly clear about what changes were being made to the system. However, the need for the Rails Internationalization API in addition to the Google's Cloud Translation API was not explained. Also, the report mentioned that strings in the actual code were not changing, which should have been explained in more detail.",1220538,1,8072
The authors have explained the required changes in a concise manner.,1219036,-1,8072
"Yes, the project design is meaningful and clear. The solution is well laid out.",1220789,-1,8072
Changes are explained but are not very descriptive. The document is not much changed since the last submission,1219779,-1,8072
The authors have not explained properly the modifications that needs to be made. They have just written the objective.,1220077,1,8072
Yes. ,1220623,-1,8072
"Yes, the authors have specified the changes to be made in the system under the proposed project design. The changes have been included as sub heading with sub points under each. The authors have also included a relevant files heading that includes the files where changes are made.The changes involve allowing the instructor to change language for a course. In the process a separate language column will be added to the Courses table and a dropdown of languages in the Edit Courses page where a language can be chosen. Once the instructor updates the Edit Course page with the chosen language, the static strings in the Expertiza application will be changed to the chosen language. For adding multi-language support, Google Translate and Rails Internationalization API is being used. Also, two yaml files- en.yml and hi_EN.yml contains the translated strings for the respective languages. The routes.rb file and all the view files will be correspondingly modified to show the different languages after reading from the yaml files. ",1220117,-1,8072
The explanations provided by the authors seems to be good. They have referred the Rails Internationalization API guide which provides sufficient explanation for multi language support. They have mentioned the different elements that will be changed and how an instructor would proceed to change the language of the course verbally. In addition they have also added mock-ups to visually represent this information.,1218896,-1,8072
The explainations are succinct. The description in technical design section and before-after images clearly shows what the project intends to do.,1217183,-1,8072
"The changes are clearly mentioned , they are very clear what and where to make changes. Only suggestion would be to include more about how these changes are going to be done. ",1219754,-1,8072
"Yes authors have done well to explain the changes being done in the project. I think I wish they would have added is the details of languages they are supporting.   Also they do mention that they will add extra column to languages table, they could have pasted the new schema in the doc",1220197,1,8072
Yes the design appears to be sound following the appropriate principles and patterns. Fell the team could have explained in more detail.,1220228,1,8072

"As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.",1220790,-1,8072

It is sound. ,1220624,-1,8072
Looking at the design there seems to be high use of cohesion  and low coupling. It's good that all the changes are restricted to the routes.rb and config/locales files so that the resulting changes won't be messy and ruin the rest of the system. Also this helps in refactoring if needed in the future as there will be limited number of files to be changed.,1218897,-1,8072
The design appears to be clear. The inclusion of a visual aid that shows how the control transfers from the view to controller to model and back to controller and view whenever the language is changed could have been shown to help readers better understand the design.  ,1220118,0,8072
Design looks good at high level though specific details about implementation are still missing. I would expect that here.  they also state that they are using google translate details on what api they will be using would have been helpful,1220198,1,8072
"Yes, the design appears to be as simple as possible. The team has mentioned what needs to be done and how they plan to implement it.",1220229,-1,8072
The need for two translation APIs was not justified.,1220540,1,8072
"Yes, simple straightforward solution.  ",1220791,-1,8072
The changes have been explained well enough to minimize the complexity. The implementation seems extremely clear.,1219038,-1,8072
As mentioned no design diagrams are present.,1219781,1,8072
Simple and easy to understand steps.,1220079,-1,8072
"The team has mentioned properly what changes they are doing and how they will be doing them. In the first submission they had suggested the possible approaches. Now, they are having a concrete way they are implementing these changes.",1219556,-1,8034
"Yes, and at times, much more than necessary! ",1219732,-1,8034
Yes. Only view files are involving since this topic is about changing the language. ,1220625,-1,8072
Yes. The authors have made changes to the design document and are more specific about how exactly they plan to implement the new functionality.,1220503,-1,8034
No changes has been done,1219284,1,8034
"Yes, they explained a lot for the changes. Great job!",1219576,-1,8034
The design appears to be very simple. The team has avoided unnecessary complications by adhereing to the Rails Internationalization guide. They have also avoided making unnecessary changes to many files and kept the changes to the minimum number of files required.,1218898,-1,8072
" The authors have done good job explaining the changes to be made to the system, and even explaining why other, more obvious options, are not chosen. It still sounds like a complicated change to make to the system.",1219112,1,8034
The team added more information from the last time which aided in a better explanation of the problem. Good job team,1220339,-1,8034
The authors have explained well regarding their design approach to support Hindi language but it has not mentioned if their design is flexible enough to add another languages in the future. I think they can mention if their design can accomodate other languages easily or not.,1217185,1,8072
1) The authors have adequately explained the changes to be made to the design document.,1220047,-1,8034
The design is really crisp and easy to understand. One can clearly understand the problem statement and the proposed solution for the same. The design document is properly structured as well.,1219756,-1,8072
"The explanations are more than sufficient. Not only have the authors explained the changes to the system, but also explained the reasoning for considering those changes. I like the way that they also explained the other different ways they could've integrated the GitHub metrics but avoided those methods with sufficient reasoning for the same.The team has also given an explanation of their database design modifications would be like which is good.",1218733,-1,8034
Yes the current design looks simple and wholesome. Seems they have done a good job in implementing understanding how rails internationalization works. Good job   ,1220199,-1,8072
"Yes , excellent work done by the team. The design document adequately explains what is the problem that they are trying to solve, what is the proposed solution and how the solution would look like.  There are enough details to in the document to understand what is being done and what changes are proposed. The document also has enough illustrations on what is the current situation. ",1220001,-1,8034
The authors adequately explained the changes they plan to make.,1219699,-1,8034
The design seems to be sound. They have a sample design where they are explaining the tables and how they plan to work with them as well. The examples provided help understand how the data will be stored.,1219557,-1,8034
Yes,1219733,-1,8034
The visualization clearly and effectively conveys the translation capability which the project proposes to provide to Expertiza.,1220541,-1,8072
"Yes, the provided diagrams deliver sufficient information about the implementation.",1219039,-1,8072
Yes. The team intends to use grade_controller to show github metric which would be a good place to implement this functionality. The idea to involve instructors because of a 60 requests/hour limit may complicate the project. Another idea would be to update metrics with a round robin scheduling of GET requests. ,1220504,1,8034
Yes,1219285,-1,8034
The team have an image of what they plan to implement. The team however have-not used any helpful visualizations like UML diagrams that would aid in the understanding.,1220230,1,8072
"Yes, they included some design principles, which is good. Maybe the authors could add some design patterns into wiki.",1219577,-1,8034
 The design appears to be sound. They have weighed their options and are using an official gem to interact with the github api.,1219113,-1,8034
The necessary visual inputs to aid explanation are present.,1220792,-1,8072
mock UIs screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required changes.,1219782,-1,8072
I don't see any issue in the design document. They have followed a good design principle.,1220340,-1,8034
No visualization or diagrams are necessary.,1220080,-1,8072
1) The authors have mentioned several approaches in which these functionalities could be implemented. 2) Their chosen approach is follows MVC architecture and DRY principles.,1220048,-1,8034
Maybe add some design diagrams rather than just have screenshots. ,1220626,0,8072
"The design appears to be sound for most part of it. The linking between the different sections seems appropriate. The only issue I have is with the mock-up in the Design Details -> Second Change mock-up number 2. I think that the bar chart is being displayed for each and every day. I feel that is not only highly unnecessary but also would be very overwhelming for the instructor to process all this information because:-i) It is common knowledge that many students do not begin projects until a few days/weeks would have passed since the assignment is posted. So that would leave the initial few days of the bar chart empty with nothing valuable to show.ii) The duration of each project varies from project to project. Assignment 2 had a duration of about 20 -30 days. This would mean that there would be about 20 bar charts for each day which would be quite difficult for the TA/instructor to process for just one team let alone for so many other teams they need to evaluate. Suggestions: Instead of providing bar chart for each day aggregate it to a bar chart for each week or one in 5 days. And then maybe towards the deadline or like a week before the deadline you could switch to 1 barchart per day. OR Provide an option to switch between the scaling of time periods like a week, 5 days, 1 day etc.",1218734,1,8034
"The authors have shown screenshots of example output as a part of visualization. This shows the original page, the updated page with the facility to change language and the translated page to Hindi. Though this visualization displays the final output, there is no visualization that shows the design and implementation of this new feature. ",1220120,1,8072
"Yes, the github api integration looks good. the only part missing was perhaps they could have documented the rest calls that they are going to make in the document as well. Usage of existing gems is good and eases lot of implementation pains  ",1220002,1,8034
 The design sound very reasonable.  ,1219700,-1,8034
"The design is concise and clear. They have added reference images of how the system would look after their changes, which properly shows the expected implementation results.",1219558,-1,8034
Yes. It is thoroughly investigated.,1219734,-1,8034
The idea to involve instructors because of a 60 requests/hour limit may complicate the project. Another idea would be to update metrics with a round robin scheduling of GET requests. ,1220505,1,8034
Yes,1219286,-1,8034
The images of web pages clearly describe the changes to be made to the system however there are no class diagrams or use cases diagrams.,1217186,1,8072
"Their design is much simple and clear, also easy to understand.",1219578,-1,8034
"Though this project doesn't require any UML diagram as such. However, a flowchart showing the work flow would have made the design document better and efficient.",1219757,1,8072
"Yeah, I believe it is as simple as possible while choosing the best path for the expertiza project to grow, but it still sounds like a very ambitious project for 1 group to complete.",1219114,-1,8034
"The screenshots for the view are great, they help in understanding the problem statement and the solution. however the design document lacks use case or class diagrams on how extenral entity interacts with the system and gets response.  Since the authors are using external api's it would have been good if they could give more details request and response ",1220200,1,8072
"With proper documentation, the problem is explained nicely and understanding of the complex problem is made easier.",1220341,-1,8034
1) Have clearly mentioned when will GitHub Api be hit to retrive the data and which gem will be used.,1220049,-1,8034
The design appears to be fairly simple. I think however there will be difficulty in implementing the GitHub metrics for latest data vs data before the submission deadlines.,1218735,1,8034
"Yes, the authors are using already existing gems for the implementation. I would have liked to see a section on caching if any.  Rest the solution proposed looks simple and straightforward and looks that it will easily integrate into the current system  ",1220003,1,8034
 Their design is simple and clear.  ,1219701,-1,8034
The team have written a test plan. But I feel more test cases could have been written to test the edge cases. Also the team could have explained their test cases in more detail.,1220231,1,8072
The use case diagram properly shows how the addition of this feature will help for the instructor role.,1219559,-1,8034
"The test plan is clear and effective but shallow. Manual testing is good, but more description should be provided for the automated testing.",1220542,1,8072
The visualizations used by the team are comprehensive and well made.,1220506,-1,8034
Good design,1219287,-1,8034
"A testplan that covers the entire functionality has been devised, it seems sufficient to test the change.",1219040,-1,8072
"excellent use of screenshots, made things very clear for me.",1219322,-1,8034
The test plan is compatible with the problem statement. ,1220793,-1,8072
"Yes, they use a lot of diagrams to show use case.",1219579,-1,8034
As there are UI changes test plan is not required but a basic stepwise description of how to see the required output can be helpful,1219783,-1,8072
 The photos included are superb at showing the expected View.  They can have more 1 or 2 more stars if most of the Expteriza work for the github metrics was already completed when they made these screen shots. Do you think it is feasible to expect that you can start a software project before getting a green light on the project in order to include high quality pictures of your proposed View in action?,1219115,1,8034
Test plan have been shown clearly and tests are easy to understand.,1220081,-1,8072
"Yup, because it only tests the ability to change the language. ",1220627,-1,8072
Use case diagram is present but it would have been nice to see a sequence diagram to understand the flow. ,1220342,1,8034
Explains the different approaches with the help of use case diagram.,1220050,-1,8034
The design includes a brief test plan that lists three scenarios namely- the regular steps to update Course page to Hindi; checking if Edit Assignment page has also been translated and checking if other pages are translated. Some more test cases like checking if the change in language is reflected from a student login could have been included. The authors specify that Rspec and Capybara is used for testing the new feature.,1220121,1,8072
"The use case diagram appears to be slightly incorrect. The symbol for an should be a stick figure not a rectangle. But that is a minor error. Also, the Use Case Diagram Details mention student as an actor but the diagram shows no instance of student as an actor. I think the Student as an actor shouldn't be included because in the current use case only the instructor is the primary actor and the assignment should have been submitted by the time the instructor views the scores, thus, requiring no involvement from the students at that point in time.Mention of Primary sequence in the Use Case Diagram Details seems highly unnecessary and potentially unrelated.",1218736,1,8034
There are enough aids such as uml diagrams and screen shots. The authors explicitly mention that there are no db changes so no need of an er diagram. Although I would have liked some class level details to be mentioned in the document that would help to dig more about the design changes,1220004,-1,8034
The test plan seems to be fine. It basically outlines all the functionalities that the team will test. The different cases the team will test is also outlined though not many. I guess there will be more test cases to be added once the project is on the roll.,1218900,1,8072
 They not only use use case diagram but also mock-up screenshot to help the reader understand their design.  ,1219702,-1,8034
The test plan does include a high level of testing scenarios the team plans to cover. I would suggest the team should add BDD tests so they can test the same after the development phase is over.,1219560,1,8034
The test plan briefly mentions the scenarios the team plans to test. They can add more about the test cases if possible.,1217187,-1,8072
"The test plan seems adequate at this stage, edge cases may need to be considered at a later stage.",1220507,-1,8034
"The document does include a test plan section . However, it just includes what framework they plan to use for testing. No solid test planning was described in the test plan section.",1219758,1,8072
No,1219288,-1,8034
few more test cases can be added,1219323,1,8034
"I feel that the test section is in adequate, the users have only listed 3 scenarios with no details on how to implement that. Also missing are detailed steps on how to execute the tests if required.",1220201,1,8072
"Yes, it includes the test plan with a great detail.",1219580,-1,8034
 The test plan seems adequate enough to show that they understand what to test.,1219116,-1,8034
Good test plan. Should include more test cases that check the functionality of GitHub integration. eg: If number of lines of code committed by a student is correctly computed.,1220051,1,8034
Few test plan is written. The team can add more test plan.,1220343,-1,8034
The design includes a test plan. However the test plan has nothing related to tests or which test cases are going to be considered. It just explains the flow of how an instructor would reach the GitHub metrics data page.The team should at least mention which files are the test cases going to be written on and what functionalities are they going to test.,1218737,1,8034
"The test section looks inadequate as of now, only two test scenarios are mentioned and no details on automation or UI.  More so no mention of tests in the document.",1220005,1,8034
 Test plans for both of their subtasks were present.  ,1219703,-1,8034
"Yes, the authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system. Document is simple, succinct and easy to understand. Great use of flow charts, uml diagrams and mockups to visually represent the information is done. ",1219531,-1,8057
"The document provided by the team is very detailed and includes all the requirements which are suggested by the Change Request. However, the team may change tone of the document as it is instructive  right now which seems like the change request description itself. The team might also add a wiki link for this document so that it could be included in the expertiza links of existing and ongoing changes and would be more reachable to a wider audience.",1220779,1,8057
 Yes the author has provided a sufficient explanation of what changes needs to be done to the system by giving flow diagrams and screenshots about what changes they are going to incorporate in their system,1220438,-1,8057
Team has added all the diagrams and screenshots. The document is well explained and looks complete.,1220403,-1,8057
"Yes, their explanations are adequately explained the changes.",1220638,-1,8057
1) The authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system. 2) They also have given the files to be modified/added for each change.  ,1220006,-1,8057
Authors have clearly explained all the changes to be made and where to make them. The design document is quite clear and easy to understand.,1220558,-1,8057
I think that the authors have done a really good job of explaining and covering all the changes to be made. Overall this is the best document i have seen so far.,1218778,-1,8057
The authors have explained all the changes to be made very clearly and concisely. Each change is supplemented with sufficient diagrams and mock-ups so as to make the final task of visualization easier.,1218917,0,8057
The document seems complete,1219485,-1,8057
Yes the authors have tried to explain what changes are required and what they plan to do however I feel that exact changes that they might be doing are missing. They could have listed most files that will need modification and if necessary new files that will be changed,1219971,1,8057
"Yes, one of the best design docs of project 4!",1219946,-1,8057
"The document was very well written previously too, and they have improved it with diagrams and test. Nice work.",1219192,-1,8057
The authors have considerably improved on the document. UML diagrams as requested have been added.,1220804,-1,8057
"Yes, the design follows appropriate principles and patterns. suggestions: not required.",1219532,-1,8057
"The team has very well explained the steps they have planned to take for implementation of the functionality. They have stated every change they would be making for the Change request in details. They have also provided flow diagram for every actor involved and for every functionality they are going to implement.  However, the team has not explicitly mentioned the design pattern they are following for this implementation.",1220780,1,8057
" As the project is based upon making changes to the UI of the system , thus there is no such specific pattern being followed however the design that they have made available in the form of screenshots appear very much inclined with the functionalities that they need to implement .",1220439,-1,8057
Design is good,1220404,-1,8057
"Yes, their design is very sound, and principles and patterns are used appropriately.",1220639,-1,8057
"1) The design appears to be sound. 2) Also follows proper design principles eg: for making changes to nomination and review questions, inheritance is used (inheriting methods from questions parent class)",1220007,-1,8057
" The design seems to be sound. There are a lot of mention of which files will be modified however, as I said in the previous round, there is no mention of the layout of the existing database or if the changes they will make currently will change the database. Suggestion: Team could mention what tables are present in the database of the Bacui project. I believe this will be really helpful since most of the reviewers are working on Expertiza projects and have no knowledge of Bacui projects. At the very least the team could mention which tables the project will be interacting with along with their structure.",1218918,1,8057
They have explained very well,1219486,-1,8057
Yes the design follows simple rails concepts and is pretty straightforward. I would like to see if the team uses existing gems available to speed up implementation and re use.   ,1219972,-1,8057
"Yes, looks clean. Any design patterns used????",1219947,-1,8057
"Yes, the design appears to be sound and well made. ",1219193,-1,8057
"Yes, the design appears to be sound. There could be some rearrangement in the mock-up layout, e.g. text box for email address and 'Add' button could have the same horizontal alignment for a better user interface.",1220805,-1,8057
The design seems to be very simple. I think the team has avoided unnecessary complications and are doing minimal changes to existing system to solve issues given to them.,1219533,-1,8057
The design approach seems justified and inline with the functionalities required to be implemented. They have mentioned step wise details for all the changes they are going to take. Done a good job. No rework required.,1220781,-1,8057
" Yes the design is presented in a much simpler form which gives a very clear picture of how the changes are going to be implemented and which functionalities would be witnessing the changes , also as they have provide the screenshots it enhances the understanding about the project more.",1220440,-1,8057
"Yes, their design is simple and clear enough to read and understand.",1220640,-1,8057
1) The design is simple and well modularized. 2) Each method is implementing only one task as it should.,1220008,-1,8057
The design does appear to be as simple as possible. The team have not unnecessarily complicated the project.,1220560,-1,8057
"Yes, the design is pretty simple and to the point. The design proposed is very clear and talk why each change is necessary.",1218780,-1,8057
 The design is straightforward and as simple as possible. The team has thought this project out very clearly and laid the same in the form of flowcharts and mock-ups. This has greatly reduced the complexity of the project and helped decrease the chances of clutter and confusion.,1218919,-1,8057
"Yes, adequate amount of details present",1219487,-1,8057
"Yes the design looks simple. The use of mock up screens is good and greatly helps understand the flow that has been proposed. Good work! How ever in one of the flow charts the check for ""Is Admin"" does not show/label  ""Y"" or ""N"" path",1219973,1,8057
Yes!  The requirements are simple and the design plan clearly explains all the points.,1219948,-1,8057
"yes, design appears to be very simple.",1219194,-1,8057
"Yes, the design is quite simple.",1220806,-1,8057
The team have thoroughly explained the changes that need to be made and how they intend to make those changes.,1220269,1,8171
"The background is clear and thorough but the explanation of the changes to be made to the system lack detail. Terms such as DOM, the Blob APi, and ECMAScript were not explained.",1220563,1,8171
I am giving this a zero because of concerns of plagiarism. Your page has multiple sections that are direct copy pastes of the wiki that you linked to. You either need to write something original or site that this is not your work. Consider having a shorter summary of these sections and link to the other wiki for greater background as you have already done.,1220057,1,8171
"The page feel more like a project report instead of wiki page. They should not tell people to ""go through the following page"", instead they should just tell, ""the page"" is previous work.",1220867,1,8171
"Yes, they have done a great job to adequately explained their changes.",1220608,-1,8171
"They list the files to be changed for the final stage of the project, but the description of what will be changed is still lacking. I'd love to see screenshots of added code, or an explanation of what is and is not needed.",1219051,1,8171
The document clearly mentions the requirement of the project with the problem statement.,1220092,1,8171
Authors have clearly explained what needs to be done and how it would be done.,1220533,1,8171
"Yes, the authors have specified the changes that have already been implemented as a part of the OSS project and the proposed set of changes that are to be implemented as a part of the final project. Detailed information on the changes already made is available as a Wiki link to the previous document. This document clearly captures the implementation of the OffScreenCanvas Webidl and Rust files. The design document attached in this round encompasses the proposed design of- implementation of the OffScreenCanvasRenderingContext2D and enabling of the blob API for testing the code. The authors have also listed the files changed and to be changed, making it easier for the reviewers to keep track of the code on Github. Though the text is lucid, lack of a visual tool- (like flow charts, tables or UML diagrams) to concisely illustrate the workflow might make it difficult for new readers to follow the functionalities proposed and the interlinking of various modules. So, one suggestion at this point is that the authors could have included a visual representation of the design. Apart from that, the document is well made and credits to the team.",1219107,1,8171
The authors have adequately explained the changes made to the system. Ot would have been better if some visual modes are added.,1219936,1,8171
"The authors do a great job of explaining the technical details and the api functionality of the requirements. Furthermore, they provide a list of files that are going to be changed in the scope of this project. However, the document would be more complete if the authors provided more details about specifics of changes. For example the description of high level changes pertaining to the OffscreenCanvasContextRendering2D is adequate, but it would be better if the authors elaborated on the code that is going to be filtered out.",1218806,1,8171
they have done this part.,1220137,-1,8171
Yes the design appears to be sound following the appropriate principles and patterns.,1220270,0,8171
"Duplicating code and fixing it for the new implementation is an effective strategy but not very DRY and could result in code that is hard to maintain, read, and test.",1220564,1,8171
"There is less about what they gonna do, but more about ""before and after part""",1220868,1,8171
need to include a flow diagram,1220429,1,8171
"Yes, they have well explained their design.",1220609,-1,8171
"The design sounds good, but that's largely due to how vague it is: naturally we want to add the things we need to add, and remove the things we need to remove.",1219052,1,8171
The authors have not mentioned the name of the design pattern used but have mentioned the steps for implementation.,1220093,1,8171
"Yes, the design appears to be sound and appropriate.",1220534,-1,8171
"The design does appear to be sound, which involves the Rust implementation of the Web IDL files namely- OffScreenCanvas and OffScreenCanvasContext2D Web IDL file. I look forward to the complete implementation of the project.",1219108,1,8171
"Great use of UML diagrams, flowcharts and mock-ups by the team to clearly explain the flow of their work. It is easy to understand the flow and how the end product will look like.",1219534,-1,8057
The design appears to be sound.,1219937,-1,8171
They team has done awesome work in representing every detail possible in the flow diagrams. They have created UML diagrams which depicts the flow of the admin and students along with other actors. As mentioned earlier they have also represented the admin flow diagram and instructor flow diagram through the flow chart which makes it very easy for end user to understand the workflow of the requirements in the expertiza system.,1220782,-1,8057
The high level view of the solution appears to be reasonable. The problem with this design is that there is no discussion present about any principles or patterns that are going to be utilized as part of the solution. I would suggest using certain keywords to make the decisions more clear to the reader. For example the authors talk about reusing the code of HTMLCanvasContextRendering2D and WebGLRenderingContext. It would be helpful if the concrete mechanism were specified. For example patterns like Decorator or Adapter would be relevant for this case.,1218807,1,8171
 Yes the visualization is pretty clear and good.,1220441,-1,8057
not very well. lack of the use case.,1220138,1,8171
Proper use of UML to explain the use cases and flow charts to explain the workflow has been done. The plan is complete.,1220406,-1,8057
"Yes, the design appears to be as simple as possible. The team has mentioned what needs to be done and how they plan to implement it.",1220271,-1,8171
The design seems straightforward and simple.,1220565,-1,8171
"There is less about what they gonna do, but more about ""before and after part""",1220869,1,8171
"Yes, their visualization is good. They are clear and well described the changes.",1220641,-1,8057
"In my view, they are simple and clear.",1220610,-1,8171
"The design is indeed very simple, because I don't know what it will actually entail to complete the last part.",1219053,1,8171
"1) In the UML diagram the set of actions that the instructor can perform to add more than one question to nomination and textual type is not added. Also add the actions to modify the display sequence of existing questions. 2) In the instructor flow-chart, the flow for review questionnaire and to modify the display sequence of existing questions is missing.",1220009,1,8057
Simple design with the use of interface and APIs.,1220094,-1,8171
The design seems to be quite simple,1220535,-1,8171
" The design document includes flow charts, UML diagrams and screenshots which is really impressive as it made the document easier to understand. ",1220561,-1,8057
"The design feels simple and not much different from the one I saw in Round 1, in my perspective because I have already reviewed the project in the previous round. But, to a new reviewer it might not be that direct at first as they need to understand the base of the project and the first phase of implementation which is covered in the wiki document of the previous project.",1219109,1,8171
The design appears to be simple.,1219938,-1,8171
I loved the overall use of the visualizations which aids to the understanding of the whole doc. The formatting of the documentation makes it really easy to read and understand.,1218781,-1,8057
"The main thread behind the design seems to be reusing the existing code which provides the similar functionality. This is a great idea. It is consistent with the appropriate programming principles e.g. not reinventing the wheel. One suggestion would be for the authors to explain why the instance of the class, from which the relevant parts of code are going to be copied, is not directly used as this would be a more DRY approach. In a case if this is not possible, then providing a proper reasoning and justification would be helpful.",1218808,1,8171
redundant description.,1220139,1,8171
"Though the team have explained their work pretty well, the team should think about adding a few diagrams to better help in the understanding of the project. Currently the team have not used any diagrams.",1220272,1,8171
It would be nice to see a mockup of the off-screen canvas.,1220566,1,8171
A suggestion would be to add some visualization about what the offscreenCanvas does would be helpful.,1220014,-1,8171
Still no visualizations of any kind,1220060,1,8171
No there is not any chart.,1220870,1,8171
"No, they didnt use any visualization.",1220611,1,8171
No new visualizations were added for the fourth part of the project.,1219054,1,8171
No diagrams are required for this project.,1220095,1,8171
The design does not include any kind of diagram. It would have been better if a flowchart or a class diagram could have been included in the document.,1220536,1,8171
"The current document does not include a visualization tool- inclusion of such a tool would have made the document more readable.  Nevertheless the link to the Wiki of the previous document includes a flow diagram that clearly outlines the code flow of how the control flows from the incorporation of OffScreenCanvas web IDL file to its Rust implementation in OffScreenCanvas.rs, to the DOM implementation and finally to the renderer. ",1219110,1,8171
It would have been better if some screenshots and UML diagrams was added to the design doc to better explain the functionality.,1219939,1,8171
There are no diagrams present in the document. While the diagrams for apis and class interactions may have been helpful they are not necessary for this project as the authors provide a detailed explanation of the relevant functionalities.,1218809,1,8171
no diagram,1220140,1,8171
"hough the team have explained their work pretty well, the have not included a test plan. It is an important part of the project and should be included",1220273,1,8171
"The test plan is clear but shallow. Finer grain tests should be described, not simply functional tests.",1220567,1,8171
There is no test plan.,1220061,1,8171
No there is no test plan,1220871,1,8171
"No, they didnt include any test plan in their design.",1220612,1,8171
No test plan was provided for the part 4 project.,1219055,1,8171
No test plan has been mentioned.,1220096,1,8171
The document does not include any test plan,1220537,1,8171
"Since it is a Mozilla project testing is not necessary, but the previous design documentation does touch upon the specifics of testing how an OffScreenCanvas is rendered.",1219111,-1,8171
It would have been better if a test plan covering changes made to the system was added to the design doc.,1219940,1,8171
"The test plan is not included in the design document. While the instances of testing are certainly mentioned, e.g. ""specific functionalities could be tested by writing a custom html file and then running it the similar way."" and ""Finally, well test our code by enabling the blob API."" the authors do not provide an extensive discussion of specifically what functionality is going to be tested.",1218810,1,8171
no. not mention about that.,1220141,1,8171
"The diagrams seems to be good for most of the part. One can understand the project by looking at the diagrams itself. However, in one of the instructor flow diagram, it's given that if the instructor's status is pending the instructor will set the limit to 10. That doesn't make sense. Why would the instructor himself/herself set the limit to 10. Isn't this the responsibility of the system itself to handle this or at the most the admin? Suggestions: Change the 'yes' branch of is pending? to loop 10 times or somehow indicate that pending instructors can add only 10 students to an assignment.",1218920,1,8057
Yes the presence of use case diagrams and flow charts explaining the work flow is good. It would be nice if there were more uml diagrams such as sequence so show various class interactions.  Presence of mockup screens is good. That helps in understanding what is being implemented. It would have been good if the authors put in more details about the validations that that propose in the system ,1219974,-1,8057
"Class diagrams are missing. Class diagrams are missing. First flow diagram looks perfect. Second needs some modifications - the instructor login flow should not include a step to set the count limit to 10. This should have been done before only. You should add a step to perform a check to see if the total students count is crossing the allowed limit(10). If yes, then don't add this new student and show some proper error message to the user. If no, then add the student.",1219949,1,8057
"Yes, the uml diagrams sufficiently provide visualization.",1219195,-1,8057
The authors have added UML diagrams as requested in the previous review and it has made a lot of difference. The explanation is much clearer now.,1220807,-1,8057
Test plan outlines the functionalities that the team will test and it seems sufficient to test the changes.,1219535,-1,8057
They team has done tremendous job in following the test driven approach for the project implementation. They have already included the tests they are writing for the functionality implementation. They have covered the exhaustive scenarios  for the project in their test. Their test plan is highly appreciative.,1220783,-1,8057
 The test plan is quite good as it covers all the test cases in the form of 11 test cases which test all the functionalities for the admin and the instructor role. It also considers the negative test cases like throwing an exception when the pending instructor tries to add more then 10 students to his/her course.,1220442,-1,8057
Tests can be made more exhaustive. For now it looks like only the view will be tested but controller should be tested as well.,1220407,-1,8057
"Yes, they include the test plan.",1220642,-1,8057
1) The test cases cover all of the functionalities that they are going to implement.,1220010,-1,8057
"Yes, the document includes a test plan. There was no test plan present in the previous version of the design document but the team included the test plan in the second round. The test plan is clear and seems like it would really test the functionalities.",1220562,-1,8057
The test plan has been written in a very good way following the great quality of documentation till the end. It covers all the edge cases and scenarios.,1218782,-1,8057
The test plans are excellent. The best I have seen so far.It has accurately taken all test cases into consideration and described the layout of the final test in the form of a pseudo code. Well Done on the test plan!!,1218921,-1,8057
"Yes, test plans are included",1219489,-1,8057
I would the test section incomplete. The authors have mentioned about 11 test cases thats all. I think that is not at all sufficient. Also missing are unit tests if any and UI tests if any.  I would have liked mention of more test cases both automated as well as UI tests that will ensure basic sanity to the system,1219975,0,8057
"Yes, the test plan looks good. It covers all the functionalities.",1219950,-1,8057
Test plan seems thorough and well thought out.,1219196,-1,8057
The team is following a Test Driven Development approach. They have defined the test cases that need to be tested after the implementation. It seems to completely test the feature.,1220808,-1,8057
"Yes, the issues and the proposed solutions are clearly written.",1220678,-1,8039
Yes they have,1220102,-1,8039
"Yes, this is the best design I have reviewed. It has clearly explained the changes in steps. the formatting is great, and it's very well made with very good design details and objectives. It also included the current scenario and a typical score table. It should be great if there's an expected final outcome visualization as well.",1220172,-1,8039
Yes the authors have adequately described the changes required to be made to the system. The process has been divided into steps and each step describes changes in the MVC files. Good job,1220799,-1,8039
The problem and the changes needed is explained clearly,1220508,-1,8039
"Yes, they explained a lot with two steps.",1218922,-1,8039
I really loved the way that the authors have provided a detailed proposed plan section making it very clear about the changes that are required to be made in order to tackle the given problem statement.,1218758,-1,8039
The documentation is somewhat ambiguous,1219495,1,8039
"The authors have described 1-2 solutions of the problem. However, I would suggest them to include more about how these changes will be done and where are these changes going to occur, what files will be affected etc.",1219876,-1,8039
"All problem statements have been explained, this time including an elaborate test plan.",1220264,-1,8039
"The design is ambiguous. The team only said they will make ""some"" changes to the current system but didn't state clearly what kind of changes they will make and how these changes will be done. For example, for the first step, we need more information about how the team will change the UI, the model and the controller or helper to realize what the team said.",1219362,1,8039
"Yes, the author explained the plan clearly. The steps and the files need to be modified are listed.",1218723,-1,8039
"As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.",1220679,-1,8039
Yes it looks sound,1220103,-1,8039
"The  design is sound. It completely follows the instructions. It also has detailed implemenation plan in each steps. I think it follows the DRY principle, because it uses existing implementations, fully understood the existing implementations, and added the functions above. I think it should also follow the factory pattern, although not shown in the design doc.",1220173,-1,8039
Yes the system is well designed and the UI looks neat as well. They have put effort into the UI thinking process.,1220800,-1,8039
"Although the design provided is clear, there might be some more work needed to optimize it properly and make it work as intended. ",1220509,1,8039
Yes they have,1220192,-1,8081
explained details about their solution and what will be changed after their implementation.,1220588,-1,8081
"Yes, changes to be made are clearly explained",1219152,-1,8081
"The changes to be made to improve the existing system have been adequately explained in the design document. The filters by which the data needs to be curated have also been stated. However, it would be better if they started by giving a short description of the problem statement and then going into specifics.",1219664,1,8081
They have explained in detail about the proposed changes with individual diagrams for each case. It is very thorough in explanation,1219546,-1,8081
"Great documentation. Tbh, the best i have seen yet.  ",1219026,-1,8081
They have documented it in a very rehearsed manner,1219490,-1,8081
"The design document is really well written. It clearly describes what needs to be done, how it needs to be done and what code changes need to be made. The files and tables affected are clearly listed.",1219866,-1,8081
The authors have prepared the design document quite well.,1219207,-1,8081
The documentation looks great as a high-level design document. Low-level technical details(code level) should also be covered.,1219961,1,8081
The author has explained extensively about the changes to be made to the system.,1217242,-1,8081
"Yes, the problem definition and the proposed solution are pretty clear. They also provide some diagrams to explain their project which is helpful.",1218728,-1,8081
Their introduction and problem definition are clearly enough to explained the changes.,1217411,-1,8081
"With er diagram and database details, the design looks good. ",1220589,-1,8081
The design follows appropriate principles and patterns as required,1219153,-1,8081
"The project consists of making a search function to select specific users, assignments etc using some criteria. So they're creating a search functionality for individual models.",1219665,1,8081
Yes the proposed changes make only required additions.,1219547,-1,8081
Yes it follows appropriate principles. ,1219027,-1,8081
The design appears to be sound. It is really well structured. It is easy to follow. It clearly states the changes to be made and the files affected by these changes.,1219867,-1,8081
The design appears to be sound and clearly indicates the proposed code changes.,1219208,-1,8081
"Design approaches are clearly explained (yes, the 2nd approach is the correct approach). Any design patterns used???",1219962,1,8081
"The design follows appropriate principles, but no design patterns have been used.",1217243,-1,8081
"Yes, the design is appropriate.",1218729,-1,8081
"Yes, they provide solution for different problem situations.",1217412,-1,8081
Yes it is fairly simple,1220194,-1,8081
"no complex design, only few places need to add functionalities, and they all very similar.",1220590,-1,8081
"The design is simple, although the ER diagram takes a little time to decipher since it is quite big",1219154,-1,8081
"Yes, the approach described in the design document is easy enough to understand. They have also backed their decision to go with the second approach with appropriate reasoning.",1219666,-1,8081
The design is simple and quite comprehensive covering lots of methods of searching.,1219548,-1,8081
YEs based on the proposed solution it appears to be simple as possible.,1219028,-1,8081
The design document appears really easy to follow. A person who is new to the project can get the summary of what is happening just by reading and going through the design document.,1219868,1,8081
The design appears to be simple. However any code modifications is not mentioned yet as work project might not have started so far. it would be nice if a list of files to be modified were added.,1219209,1,8081
"Yes, easy to understand.",1219963,-1,8081
The design has been explained in a simple way. The team has explained the design using use cases which is easy to comprehend.,1217244,-1,8081
"Yes, the design is simple and feasible.",1218730,-1,8081
"Yes, clear and simple.",1217413,-1,8081
They have used apt visual aid like UML diagrams and screen shots,1220195,-1,8081
"No class diagram, but there is er diagram and tables for database, it looks a little complex, but give the idea of what is involving. ",1220591,-1,8081
Necessary diagrams are included.,1219155,-1,8081
The team has communicated their design clearly via use-case diagram and a class diagram with a description of various database tables involved.,1219667,-1,8081
Excellent use of visualizations. They already had an overall flow chart and this time additional tables and UML has been added. Best of what I've seen.,1219549,-1,8081
"Yes they do explain everything. The er diagram, use case diagram, relevant tables explain everything.",1219029,-1,8081
The diagrams seems to go out of the boundary of the pae.,1219493,1,8081
The project has great visualization. A lot of UML diagrams have been included which makes the understanding the project easier. The UML diagrams also clarifies what work is to be done.,1219869,-1,8081
"The pictures clearly demonstrate the changes being made to the system, although it is apparent where the changes would be visible. it would be nice if a image was posted having the current expertiza deployement to show where the changes would be visible",1219210,1,8081
The team has described changes using use case and ER diagrams to clearly explain the system.,1217245,-1,8081
The authors add more diagrams to help to explain the change they are going to make. The relevant tables are really helpful.,1218731,-1,8081
"They use ER diagram to describe the changes, but I think it is not very intuitive for me to understand their task.",1217414,1,8081
test plans walk through necessary functionalities.,1220592,-1,8081
"Yes, a good test plan is also included",1219156,1,8081
The test cases described will cover the functionalities described given that they write multiples tests with the same structure as described for all search criteria. ,1219668,-1,8081
A concrete test plan is also added and it has both UI and automated test details.,1219550,-1,8081
Yes this is done very well.,1219030,-1,8081
"They include a very described test plan. It has everything proper. What framework, what tests all this information is well included. They clearly specify what they aim to test.",1219870,-1,8081
The test plan is pretty good and it has both UI tests and automated tests. ,1219211,-1,8081
Manual test plans as of now! The team is planning to add Rspecs after implementation.,1219965,1,8081
The test plan is designed efficiently. They have described the UI tests and automated tests which cover most of the cases. ,1217246,-1,8081
"Two types of testing are listed, and the authors list all the cases they need to test.",1218732,-1,8081
"They have test plan section, but too few test cases.",1217415,1,8081
"Yes, the authors have significantly improved the writeup, and very adequately explained the changes that they've made.",1219774,-1,8025
"Yes, the changes are well explained. There are a lot of pictures, snipped screen shots to help explain the changes to be made. There's one issue that the screenshots are not very clear, since it's big. It would look better of the screenshots can be clearer.",1218962,1,8025
The wiki is detailed enough that it mentions all the functionalities required in the project. The team has made sure to explain all the changes they wish to make to the system. They list all columns that need to be sorted and how they will implement the sorting.,1219911,-1,8025
"The authors have explained the changes to be made to the system, including screenshots of the tables, UML diagrams as well as all the files that will be modified. Suggestion: Although all the details are explained well in the document, by writing the changes proposed to the files in bullet points or by using a diagram the document will be easier to read.",1220167,1,8025
The authors have explained enough about the changes,1220279,-1,8025
"The team has added uml diagrams, images of related web pages and provided details on jQuery tablesorter that explains well the changes the team plans to make.",1219172,-1,8025
Great improvements compared to the previous submission. Now its a Very well written document. Good job team.,1220633,-1,8025
"The authors have explained about their changes neatly, including previous suggestions. They have added detailed description about tablesorter which they plan to implement. The tablesorter is used to sort data for multiple fields for a table, using multi-tbody sorting. They plan to use it in the grades and review_mapping views. They do not plan to implement in their drop-down, but display the sorted data itself on loading the page.  The changes look more clear to me, as they have been able to implement the changes in the table view using multi-tbody sorting for submissions table. I think that introduction to Expertiza is highly unnecessary and should be removed,",1219551,1,8025
"The design document clearly specifies all the issues that are going to be addressed by this project. UI views are provided which help the reader to better understand the scope of the requirements. Moreover, the authors list the files that are going to be modified and the authors comprehensively describe how the jQuery tablesorter 2.0 library will be used for three types of sorting. One minor improvement would be to highlight the parts associated with introduced changes that link html table with the library for better readability.",1218865,1,8025
"   Yes, the team has elaborated their design approach and changes to system in detail. They have mentioned all the file changes and also provided sample code for reader understanding.",1218982,-1,8025
"They made clear explanation about their task. For example, their provide pictures to show what they need to do.  ",1217188,-1,8025
The design is very efficient and follows the standardized software engineering practices. ,1219775,-1,8025
"The design is sound because it has plans of file modification, of implemented solution, and very detailed testing plan. The DRY principle might not be well followed, since in each testing, the tester needs to log in as a super_administrator2 again. And there are five testings. ",1218963,-1,8025
"the design is sound and easy to understand. The design proposed also sounds logical, i.e to sort team names alphabetically, and grades numerically. To sort by both ascending and descending order.",1219912,-1,8025
"Yes, the design seems to be sound.",1220168,-1,8025
The authors have justified the use of jQuery table sorter by listing its advantages.,1219173,-1,8025
The team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made. the design looks good and easy to implement. ,1220634,-1,8025
"The design appears to be specific to the requirements. For this, they have used a UML design which basically explains the flow of the use-case. They have not used any principles or design patterns. However, there does not seem a need to use any, as their changes are limited to the html view and making a call to the tablesorter using JQuery. As per the document, the design does not make any redundant changes or unnecessary changes to the code. Thus, they have done a good job by optimizing the changes.",1219552,-1,8025
"The authors have improved the part of the document that describes the interactions between html and javascript parts since the 1st round. While this assignment does not require an extensive discussion about the design principles or patterns, it would be better if the document explicitly addressed this topic.",1218866,1,8025
"Yes, as its sorting, not much scope on design approach. Yet the team has documented well on their approach regarding multi-level sortings that they are undertaking in few pages. They have also considered cross-browser compatibility of their jQuery library, which is a common design miss during client-side changes.",1218983,-1,8025
"This project is not very difficult, so they don't need to follow some principles or patterns.",1217189,-1,8025
"Yes, the design is very simple to understand, and also the implementation is pretty clear and effective.",1219776,-1,8025
"yes, the design is the simplest I could think about. But it doesn't include how to change the files.  I think it can still be as simple and succinct if the modifications of files can be included. On the other hand, the expected result seems to be too long. There's too many screenshots",1218964,1,8025
The design is extremely simple and easy to understand. Good work guys :),1219913,-1,8025
"Yes, the solution proposed is simple by using the  jQuery tablesorter gem.",1220169,-1,8025
The use of jQuery plugin sounds simple and easy to use.,1219174,-1,8025
The design looks simple and clear.,1220635,-1,8025
"Yes, the design is as simple as it can be. The current scenario is explained with adequate screenshots, and the changes are explained by stating the field to be used for sorting the table. A mock-up screen of the expected output would have made it even better to understand, however reading the material is sufficient as well. The changes are not complex, as they interact with a single view at a time. The tablesorter function is also called for each view, e.g. view_submissions layout.",1219553,1,8025
"The modifications that are suggested by the team are minimalistic and cover the changes that are necessary for the javascript library to work. While it is possible to infer the majority of changes that will be introduced in this project, it would be better if the authors elaborated on the implementation of all the views as opposed to discussing only the ""view submissions"" table. ",1218867,1,8025
"The design is simple, they are adding an external JQuery library to achieve the intended sorting functionality and will be adding custom js to achieve further functionalities. As indicated earlier, not clear as to this custom js will be included in multiple pages.",1218984,1,8025
This their design is very simple and clear.,1217190,-1,8025
"This part has been significantly improved from the previous submission. The diagram make it very easy for an outsider to understand the architecture, the underlying problems and the proposed solution. ",1219777,-1,8025
"The screenshots of the expected result and the UML diagram are good, But the screenshots can be smaller to make the page more user-friendly. The UML diagram can be better if it's designed as a design plan diagram instead of a user diagram, which simply states how the reader is to approach this. Or it could be better if we have both.",1218965,1,8025
Yes. The figures added to the wiki clearly indicate the changes that will be made to each view. The columns that will be made sortable and how will the made sortable. Good work :),1219914,-1,8025
The flowchart added gives a good idea of the final outcome after implementation of the changes proposed. Suggestion: A diagram explaining the plan of changes to be made will make the document easier to read.,1220170,1,8025
"Yes, the team added visual aids like UML diagrams, screen shots, code snippets to clearly describe the changes to be made to the system. Well done!",1219175,-1,8025
This team used great diagrams that add to their documentation's clarity significantly.,1220636,-1,8025
"The authors have included a UML diagram which explains a flow of the diagram The document does not strike a balance in the use of visualization. It lacks at illustrating the changes using appropriate use-cases, mock-up screens to show the expected changes as opposed to the current scenario. The mock-up screen can include sorted values of the field whose headers you clicked upon. Also, there is no need of other visualization aids such as class diagrams, as the modifications are limited to views. ",1219554,1,8025
"There are multiple visual elements that improve the readability of the document. Screenshots of the UI tables help with the illustration of the required changes. Furthermore, the UML diagram demonstrates the relation between relevant flows.",1218868,-1,8025
The team has added good number of mock UIs and UML diagram and clearly explains the code follow. All of them are self-explanatory and needs no improvement,1218985,-1,8025
diagram is added. ,1220466,-1,8025
No visulization is necessary for this project,1217191,-1,8025
"Yes, the team has made a very good testing plan, consisting of functional testing, which covers almost all of the use cases which have been added/modified. However, the author could have added code snippets of the same, instead of just discussing the proposed plan.",1219778,1,8025
"Yes, the design includes a very good test plan. The tests are deep and detailed and completely test the functionalitys. But I think it could be better following the DRY principle if the tester don't need to log in as administrator2 every time.",1218966,1,8025
You have a lot of testing scenarios which is really good,1218890,-1,8025
"I suggest the testing plan be improved. In place of giving steps on how a reviewer should test the project, the team should instead list how they wish to write tests for the functionality added. The rspec could be something like expect(page).to have_content(sorted)",1219915,1,8025
The design doc includes the test plan which covers all the changes that will be made.,1220171,-1,8025
There is a detail explanation on how the function testing will be carried out under the teating plan section of the wiki doc.,1219176,-1,8025
Yes it includes test plan. It is very well written and will test the functionalities.,1220637,-1,8025
"Test plans looks to be an overview of the functionality, In the test plan i see the functionalities explained l",1219990,-1,8025
"  The test plan has covered test cases for testing functionalities of sorting submissions table and review mappings per field. They can also include test plan for the edge cases of the system, like the code should not break when the submissions table is empty and show should probably display a flash message saying ""no entries to be sorted!"". In this way, try to add a few negative testing to improve your coverage. This will make your code more rigid.",1219555,1,8025
"The test plan is present. It consists of a set of functional tests described for each of the five views. I would suggest elaborating on the technical side of tests, for example specifying which spec files will be modified or whether or not the project will utilize RSpec. Moreover, it would be better if the team provided a rationale for why it is sufficient to use only functional tests.",1218869,1,8025
"The test plan is complete and covers all intended functionalities. They have also provided all necessary steps to test the functionality. Good documentation on test plan. As client-side changes using script is added, a latency test to verify system is not slow in responding to sorting can be included.",1218986,-1,8025
the test plan is thorough. ,1220467,-1,8025
"Yes, they had test plan, but only simple test plan, they should add some more corner cases.",1217192,1,8025
Yes. The authors do have an adequate explanation. ,1220473,-1,8033
authors adequately explained the changes to be made to the system but it would have been better if they have provided how and what model dependency needs to be implemented to achieve the goal.   ,1220759,1,8027
they have also added the UML diagrams which makes things a lot more clearer,1219294,-1,8033
"The explanation is inadequate, needs more textual explanation of the problem and approach",1220769,1,8027
"The authors have very well explained all the changes that need to be done with the help of proper problem statement, the files that require modifications, the current and the required state.",1220087,-1,8033
Good additions on the purpose and use case of your work.,1220062,-1,8027
"Team did not explained project well with the description. Diagrams do explain the approach, but for a reader to get the overview but text description is also important. Team can work on adding text description. Same had been suggested in the last review.  ",1219526,1,8027
Just a small explanation of the proposed solution has been given. They could clearly explained more.,1220368,1,8027
"The authors used a lot of charts for use cases, this is great, but they only explained a little for implementation, which could be explained in a great detail.",1219566,1,8027
"The design is clear at a high level but lacks detail. The report described what the project is, but how will this feature be implemented?",1220593,1,8088
No,1219616,1,8088
"The authors have provided use cases for creating new subclass of Questionnaire, SupplementaryReviewQuestionnaire. However, more details can be added to the implementation section such as what new methods will be doing and test plans.",1217178,1,8027
Is decently explained,1220784,-1,8088
The team has included all the details required to implement the given requirement. The documents lacks the changes the changes that will be made to the system and also the design of the changes. the document just included the list of files that will be changes to achieve the desired result.,1219794,1,8027
Team has explain the changes to be made very well. Also screenshots of the system is helping to understand which part of system is changing.,1219536,-1,8088
The Introduction and Proposed Solution sections appropriately describes the problem and the approach to resolve the issue. The changes proposed can be concisely implemented into the system. They have enlisted use case diagrams for the entire scenario to be added to the rubrics.,1220483,-1,8027
"I cannot remember what the explanation looked like last week, but the read through this week felt very clear. The organization of the article felt like it followed the logic of a design project. The problem statement felt like it was reduced to a clear, concise, set of requirements that are attainable. The addition of the program flow diagram and an explanation as to why there is no UML diagram also helped to cement my understanding and set my expectations.",1218927,-1,8033
"Yes, it has the implementation plan of a checkbox, which allows the instructor to decide about review times. Since that is the only thing to be implemented, there's no more issues. I think the diagram doesn't have very pretty look, it should be better if the screenshot can be smaller so that the fonts in the diagrams can be seen more clearly.",1220152,1,8088
Good work on adding UML diagrams. Now the problem is very well explained.,1218748,-1,8033
"Yes, they have given a good, detailed explanation of the planned changes.",1220132,-1,8088
"Yes, they include all the details in the functionality implementation.",1219669,-1,8088
The team only provided the flow diagram to state the logic they will use when they make changes but did not provide any details about what changes they will make and how these changes will be made. The design should be more detailed to explain the changes step by step.,1219260,1,8027
The authors have mentioned about the changes,1220284,-1,8088
The team has provided a flowchart to explain the changes that they have made to the system. They have also provided screenshots of the UI that needs to be improved. This makes the design document readable and easy to understand. ,1219475,1,8088
Authors have given a brief description of the subclass of Questionnaire named SupplementaryReviewQuestionnaire that they are going to implement but it would have been better if they have provided how and what model dependency needs to implemented to achieve the goal.,1220294,1,8027
"Yes, clear and crisp.",1219966,-1,8088
The explanation is adequate. I would suggest that the design of the doc be more explicit. It may include some sub titles and the font shoule be of different sizes to emphasize some parts.,1219626,1,8027
The authors have thoroughly explained the changes made to the system.,1220892,-1,8088
"The authors gave enough explanations about the design for the UI parts. That is,  how will they design the UI and handle the problems related to UI, but they didn't give the design for how will they deal with the reviews differently when instructors check or uncheck the box. I cannot identify how can they check if the box is checked in the code, and how can they according to the status of the box to make sure the students can only update the previous reviews when the box is unchecked and students can require new reviews when the box is checked.",1219202,1,8088
"The authors have still only mentioned the UI side changes, i.e. adding a checkbox to control the functionality. They have not thought about the actual logic to limit the students from seeing the reviews. Please include this in the design as this completes the entire functionality. ",1220862,1,8088
"The authors have lucidly explained the changes that are to be made to the system. They show the current state of the system and the expected state which includes a new button to Analyze the review content in the segmented text box. The authors have specified 2 files that they plan to modify namely the view file response.html.erb and a partial _self_review.html.erb. The team clearly show the format of the response popup with suggestion metrics that capture sentiment score, sentiment tone, whether suggestions are present or not, chance of suggestions, volume of text and the volume of text without stop words. They also propose to improve the response time of extracting the output from the API.One suggestion is that the team could have touched upon the working of the suggestion detection algorithm though it is not part of their current implementation. They do mention that it is a black box and have included a link to the deployed NLP project for suggestion algorithm, where users can test the suggestion metrics generated for custom text.",1219327,-1,8033
"The authors have explained the scope of the project pretty well. But as I mentioned in the earlier review, a whole paragraph on the background of expertiza is not required, one or two sentences would have sufficed.",1220112,1,8033
yes they have explained it very well.,1219031,-1,8033
The authors have given sufficiently good explanation for the changes to be made to the system. They have explained which files they will change as well as the flow of the project.One thing that they have failed to mention is what API are they planning to use. I would like to know that as that would be a key piece of information for this document's completeness.,1218907,1,8033
The changes proposed are well explained and clearly indicate the intended output.,1219197,-1,8033
The authors have adequately explained changes made to the system. They have explained the problem and proposed solution clearly and supported it with appopriate diagrams.,1219921,-1,8033
"The authors have worked well since the last review and incorporated some of the suggestions. They have now finalized the input and output formats. However, I still am unsure about the algorithm implementation they have proposed. They have kept it as a black box, which makes the design quite inadequate. It becomes difficult to review if their methods, classes are in the right direction or need any modification. They should have at least given a high level overview of the algorithm. Also, I have observed that the additional comments box also contains valuable suggestions many of the times. Please mention if you have considered the additional comments box in your analyze functionality.",1219709,1,8033
"The design appears appropriate, but since it is shallow, it is hard to tell how sound it is. How will a user be prevented from requesting another review? Also, the naming seems to assume either one or two rounds. What about more than two rounds?",1220594,1,8088
Very detailed and precise. Solution explained thoroughly. ,1220107,-1,8033
No patterns mentioned,1219617,1,8088
"The design seems good. However, it would be better if the author can mention the design principles and patterns followed in the documentation. ",1220760,1,8027
yes,1220785,1,8088
The desgn looks okay,1220770,-1,8027
Yes design appears to be sound. Also the flow diagram helps us understand it better. Team did not use any design pattern. ,1219537,1,8088
Design plan has not changed since I last reviewed. A bit more detail would still be nice,1220063,1,8027
"The design is sound because it has a well-developed plan for writing the funcationality, and it also has a detailed code level design. It does follow the DRY principle, because it adds on directly from the given files, thus does not repeat itself. It doesn't use observable patterns here. But that's because there's not a lot of implementations to be made. And it does follow the pattern of the original file.",1220153,1,8088
The design appears sound.,1220133,-1,8088
"Yes, it seems very sound and workable.",1219670,-1,8088
Design doc does not explain the approach to resolve the issue to be taken well. As i could see only 2 lines of explanation. Team should explain the design more clearly for naive users too. Team has not used any design principle.,1219527,1,8027
"The design appears to be sound, they are checking if its multiple round exists and adding the checkbox functionality.",1220285,-1,8088
The design is clear and easy to interpret. The team has provided a code snippet which explains the changes to be made in the system to implement the solution.,1219476,-1,8088
The approach looks fine to me. It should be easy to test it based on the test plan given. Any design patterns used??,1219967,1,8088
The team has used appropriate principles but no design patterns. They have explained the design plan extensively.,1220893,1,8088
"The design lacked enough explanation about how will they deal with reviews when the box is  checked and unchecked. For the naming of the function and database, the name seems too long. It is better to make the name shorter and easy to understand.",1219203,-1,8088
The team has submitted a partial design and the part they have thought about is complete. The rest has not been thought through. Please consider the design for the logic necessary to show/hide the reviews for the students.,1220863,1,8088
Basic complexity,1219618,-1,8088
Looks simple,1220786,-1,8088
Design doc shows a good amount of work to be done. Team has articulated changes to be made well that makes design doc simple to understand.,1219538,-1,8088
"Yes, the design is simple. The design includes details in checking rounds: when it's bigger than or equal to 2, add the checkbox and otherwise do nothing. However, I doubt if that's needed in design document. Since in the future if we need to do 3-round reviews, this 2 feature can be misleading.",1220154,1,8088
"Well, not much information has been given on the wiki page. Though they have put some UML flow diagrams which give us an idea of the flow.",1220369,1,8027
The design is seems to be as simple as possible.,1220134,-1,8088
"Yes. According to what they wrote, they are going to realize this project from 2 sides, the instructor side and the student side. The steps are very clear.",1219671,-1,8088
The design appears to be simple and easily understandable,1220286,-1,8088
"Yes, simple and straightforward.",1219968,-1,8088
The design has been made as simple as possible. The complexity of the design is simplified using flow charts.,1220894,-1,8088
"The logic showed in the design is clear and easy enough, but the deign lacks essential details for dealing with reviews.",1219204,1,8088
"It looks like sound, but I think the authors could add some principles and patterns which they may use into wiki.",1219567,1,8027
This is a fairly simple design.,1220864,-1,8088
The design flow seems simple from the use case diagrams but I cannot review the principles part as it is not adequately explained.,1217179,1,8027
"The visualization clearly conveys the high-level goals of the project. It does not explain the design in detail, however.",1220596,1,8088
No visualization,1219619,1,8088
"Yes a variety of apt visual aid has been used like screenshots, UML diagram etc",1220787,-1,8088
"Team has added a flow diagram and system screenshots. Team could added UML diagrams, so as to understand sequence of events or actors involved.",1219539,1,8088
"There's only one diagram, from the perspective of the user, in terms of how the functionality should be like. It does clearly describe the changes to be made to the system. It should be better if there's another diagram, which explains the work flow, in terms of which files we need to do at each step, and what we need to do one step after another to implement the project.  ",1220155,1,8088
The flowchart included concisely explains the functionality they plan to add. Suggestion: Add UML diagrams for Use case or sequence diagrams to explain their implementation design. This will make the design planned easier to follow.  ,1220135,1,8088
They had 2 diagrams. One for UI and one for the implementation. The implementation can me less words and more simple.,1219672,1,8088
The team has used flowcharts and UI which was necessary for this project.,1219478,-1,8088
Not enough. Use case diagram and class diagrams are missing.,1219969,1,8088
The team has not used many diagrams to explain the changes made in the project. They have just explained using a simplified flowchart. No Use case or ER diagrams have been used to explain the changes made.,1220895,1,8088
The diagram in UI part states clearly the changes the authors intend to make and how it will be like. The flow diagram explains clearly the design logic and help me understand what changes the team will make.,1219205,-1,8088
The team has used mock-ups and a flowchart to show the basic functionality.,1220865,-1,8088
"The manual tests listed should adequately test the functionality, but information should be provided on automated testing.",1220597,1,8088
No testing,1219620,1,8088
Test plan looks good,1220788,1,8088
"Team has not mentioned test cases that they are going to write. Manual testing steps are mentioned. Team should work on adding test cases, as manual test does not help to check  all the corners of the complex system well.",1219540,1,8088
"There's a test  plan. The test plan is deep and indeed tests the functionality. It should be better if the test plan also includes another step between 4 and 5, in terms of how to make the step ""student can(or cannot) do the second review without the first one"".",1220156,1,8088
Tests with different scenarios are provided.,1220136,-1,8088
"Yes. According to what they wrote, they are going to realize this project from 2 sides, the instructor side and the student side. The steps are very clear.",1219673,-1,8088
"The team has explained the manual testing process. suggestion : include how the ""Go"" functionality is actually tested in ruby . Include edge cases for the testing functionality.",1220288,1,8088
"The team has written steps that are required to test the system. However, they could improve this by adding test code that would test the basic functionality.",1219479,1,8088
Manual test plan as of now. Try to automate it if possible.,1219970,1,8088
The team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made. the design looks good and easy to implement.,1219795,-1,8027
All the tests have not been implemented. but the test plan has been described. Could have included more test cases to extensively test the system. Automated test could have been written.,1220896,1,8088
"The test plan is not adequate enough and a little bit ambiguous. For the checkbox part, there are many cases not included. For example, the checkbox is unchecked by default, in different cases, the checkbox will show or not. For the student side, 5 for each case is not clear enough and I cannot identify what the anticipated results for these cases should be.",1219206,1,8088
The authors have included an elaborate test plan which tests even the functionality they have missed to mention in the proposed design part of the document. This is quite complete.,1220866,-1,8088
"The authors mention within their UML diagrams section that they are making only HTML changes, however, they have still not explained how the requests will be sent, no explanation has been given yet on how the team intends to implement timing the response of the API.",1220474,1,8033
The document does not mention the name of the design pattern used but clearly mentions the steps to be done in order to implement the required functionalities.,1220088,1,8033
The design seems to be clear such that it provides the implementation procedure to be followed to include the feature of adding student generated questions to the rubrics.,1220484,-1,8027
"The details are not enough, so it is difficult to tell if the design follows approbate principles. The diagrams covers most of changes they need to make.",1219261,1,8027
"They explained from their requirements and in their flow, that they only need to plan to edit the View, so there is no need for a UML.",1218928,-1,8033
Documentation is proper. Team could have added DB tables as well in the design doc.,1218749,1,8033
Design concept seems promising but a brief introduction about how each module will be implemented for both reviewer and reviewee is missing. ,1220295,1,8027
The design is sound.,1219627,-1,8027
"As per the documentation, the design seems simple.",1220761,-1,8027
Not much explanation given,1220771,1,8027
Looks very doable,1220064,-1,8027
"Yes from the diagrams I could say, design and design flow is simple enough and team has well understood the changes to be made.",1219528,-1,8027
"Yes, the design is sound and clear. Majority of the work is done by the suggestion algorithm. The team proposes to integrate this functionality into Expertiza and also improve the response time. This project does not need to incorporate any design pattern as only the view files are altered. The project does not impact the degree to which it is object oriented.",1219328,-1,8033
"Since the task is to integrate a web service in the existing system, the design mentioned is sound and reasonably primitive. ",1220113,-1,8033
yes it does based on the proposed solution.,1219032,-1,8033
"The design is good. However, there is no scope of using bad principles since the number of files that will be affected are minimal and restricted to just 2.",1218908,-1,8033
The design doc is sound and I believe no design patterns are required for this project.,1219198,-1,8033
The design appears sound.,1219922,-1,8033
"Keeping the suggestion detection algorithm as a black box, as stated in the design document I will comment on the input and output to the algorithm. The input will be a text block of the review comments to the algorithm, and the output is consisting of different fields such as sentiment score, sentiment analysis as positive/negative, suggestion as present or absent. However, it is unclear to me as to what basis (the suggestion detection algorithm details/explanation/high level overview) do you classify the data into suggestion classifier.",1219710,1,8033
"Yes, design seems fit. More insight required on the algorithm itself and how it will be implemented.",1220108,1,8033
"Yes, the design in its current form seems straight forward.",1220475,-1,8033
"The Requirements were distilled down to the fewest simple terms possible without over-generalization. It felt like they just gave me the tl;dr statement without any fluffy words to waste my time, and also feels like they have a strong grasp over what they are expected to accomplish.",1218929,-1,8033
"Yes, the design appears to be simple. ",1218750,-1,8033
"Yes, the design appears to be very simple",1220370,-1,8027
"Yes, the design is very simple and easy to follow.",1219568,-1,8027
The design seems simple but it is unclear on the implementation section. The authors can add more on how they plan to add new code or modify existing implementations to achieve their goal.,1217180,1,8027
The design appears to be simple and straightforward to implement. The team has also included all the files that will be changed to achieve the desired results,1219796,-1,8027
The design appears simple to be executed based on the procedure specified and the list of diagrams given that it justifies the implementation to be carried out.,1220485,-1,8027
"Yes the design is simple and illustrated well with the use of wireframes showing the current, expected state and UML diagram showing the flow diagram. It depicts that once the Analyze button is clicked, the request is sent as JSON which contains the text typed by reviewer in the segmented textbox to the API which generates the suggestion metrics. The response contains the suggestion metrics like sentiment score, sentiment tone, presence of suggestions, chance of suggestion, total volume of text and volume of text without stop words. ",1219329,-1,8033
"Yes, the design is simple and clear. The task is to integrate a web service which returns a result in JSON format.",1220114,-1,8033
"The diagram is clear and easy to understand, from the diagram, the design may be easy and clear to implement. More details should be provided to evaluate further about the complexity.",1219262,-1,8027
yes it does appear to be simple as possible.,1219033,-1,8033
"Though not much of design has been giving but as per the functional diagram given, it appears simple implementation ",1220296,1,8027
The design is simple and easy to understand. Could be better if implementing some code level design.,1219628,-1,8027
The design is as simple as it could be since the flow of logic is pretty linear and there is no scope of complexity. The changes also seems to be restricted to just one file which is good and in keeping with sound principles.,1218909,-1,8033
It would be better if UML and Class diagram are added as a part of the documentation. ,1220762,-1,8027
Flow charts have been used but no UML or screen shots,1220772,1,8027
Diagrams are still overly large.,1220065,1,8027
"Team has provided good amount of use case diagrams, which actually are heart of the whole design doc and explains the design and approach well.",1219529,-1,8027
They have made some UML diagrams which could describe the changes.,1220371,-1,8027
"Yes, they use a lot of charts to explain the use cases. Great job!",1219569,-1,8027
The use case diagrams are understandable but I think images of web pages will make things more clear.,1217181,1,8027
The team has include the use case diagrams for all the scenarios related to the requirement. Some UI mockups would have helped othwewise great work.,1219797,1,8027
The use case diagrams provided to describe the role of each user through the flow and specify how each case maps to another in order for the desired functionality to be achieved.,1220486,-1,8027
"The diagram is logistic and it's easily to tell the logic behind the changes. By reading these diagrams, I can get an understanding of this project quickly.",1219263,-1,8027
UML and Class diagram are needed.  If the screenshot of the same functionality was given then it would have been better.,1220297,1,8027
"Yes, the flow charts are complete and readable. All cases are included.",1219629,-1,8027
Please add a test plan to the documentation in order to make sure that the test plan is covering the code changes.,1220763,1,8027
Test plan is missing,1220773,1,8027
This section is still blank. ,1220066,1,8027
"No. Team did not mentioned anything under Test Plan.Team should work on this part of project as well, as manual testing will not help to check all the corners of the complex project.",1219530,1,8027
need to include test plan,1220437,1,8027
There is no test plan. The section is left blank.,1220372,1,8027
"There is only a title for test plan, which could be in a great detail.",1219570,1,8027
The test plan section in the doc is left blank. The authors have not stated if the project requires any testing or not.,1217182,1,8027
The team included a test plan section is the documentation which is currently blank. the team should include the automated and manual test scenarios in the document.,1219798,1,8027
The test plan section included in the design document does not provide any content. It could specify the various scenarios considered and describe how each functionality could be tested.,1220487,1,8027
"There is no test plan included in the design document. Actually, there should be a lot of tests need to be done for this project. From the UI, controller to model, the project should include test plan cover all these aspects to make sure the function can work as intended.",1219264,1,8027
"A test plan is there without any details, just the files which will be modified or added are given ",1220298,1,8027
I'm afraid there is still no test plan in the second round.,1219630,1,8027
The actual project work might not have been started yet so the code modifications have not been mentioned. But the files to be modified seem appropriate.,1219199,1,8033
The design appears very simple.,1219923,-1,8033
"The complexity is again a big unknown to me, as they have kept the algorithm as a black box. It is unclear where the algorithm changes are to be implemented, if it is in a controller, and if yes, in which controller. I suggest the authors to provide internal details of the algorithm in order to understand their proposed solution better. As of now, I am clear about their input and output formats, however I would like to know which functions do they interface with.",1219711,1,8033
Can't say as code is not visible.,1220109,1,8033
The project does not necessarily need diagramatic explanations but UML diagrams have been used which show implementation plan fairly well.,1220476,-1,8033
the screenshots of the Expertiza system are very helpful in understanding the problem and the solution,1219297,-1,8033
The Flow diagram mentioned in the document clearly explains the changes need to be done.,1220090,-1,8033
"The author has excellently explained about the changes that they would be making by providing the design diagram and the screenshot of the the changes that they have incorporated .Also they have mentioned about their choice of tool which is google chart and why do they prefer , so overall a good explanation",1220478,-1,8080
Changes that's needs to be made has been explained correctly.,1220543,-1,8080
"Yes, their doc has adequately explained the changes.",1220658,-1,8080
The team have a well written design document and and the authors have explained the proposed changes well. The authors have also listed each file they are going to be changed.,1220673,-1,8080
"yes, the team has well explained the changes that they are going to make. Last time it was a bit confusing but this time because of the help of the diagrams and mock UI screen, the solution seems clear now.",1219722,-1,8080
The authors have explained the changes made to the system. The design flow greatly helps to understand the flow of the system.,1220259,-1,8080
"Yes, this team has made the best use of visualization tools that can be applied to their project. They have clearly shown wireframes of the current response page juxtaposed with the expected state with the Analyze button next to each rubric. The document also includes the flow of the project represented as UML diagram. Once the Analyze button is clicked the request text is sent to the suggestion detection algorithm. The API returns the response which contains the suggestion metrics like sentiment score, sentiment tone, presence of suggestions, chance of suggestion, total volume of text and volume of text without stop words. ",1219330,-1,8033
The authors have described what all changes they plan to do and where they plan to do it. Compared to the previous version of the design document they have now included what tools and framework they plan to work on. The design document looks complete and understandable now.,1219814,-1,8080
They will be changing mostly html and erb code to create a visual interface that delivers information to instructors more effectively.,1219596,-1,8080
The proposed changes have been explained in a simple manner.,1219097,-1,8080
"The use of visualization is not pivotal for this task as it can be explained theoretically as well. But still, the team has made an effort to present the task with help of a flow diagram.",1220115,-1,8033
"yes, very well explained.",1219034,-1,8033
"The document adequately describes the project description and proposals made. The proposed change of generating a single or single bar chart graph based on the categories selected to display the chart, can be efficiently made to the system.",1220453,-1,8080
"There were mock-ups of how the Analyze button would be displayed along side each rubric, however there is no mock-up for how the response would be displayed.Suggestions: I would like to see where and how would that response be displayed because from the flow diagram the response seems to be quite big. I would like to also know if the team is planing to display all the components of the response from the API or just a few.",1218910,1,8033
They have improved the document to provide a better description of changes to be made to the system.,1219227,-1,8080
The screenshots clearly display where the output would be displayed.,1219200,-1,8033
Yes the design is sound and gives a proper explanation about how their implementation would behave.,1220479,-1,8080
Design seems correct.,1220544,-1,8080
"Yes, their design is clear and sound, and the principles and patterns are well used.",1220659,-1,8080
The design documents is well explained. the authors haven't mentioned any design pattern as such. The authors have clearly stated the proposed changes though. they could have added uml and crc cards.,1220674,1,8080
yeah their design seems to be sound and neat.,1219723,-1,8080
System is well defined ,1220260,-1,8080
"The document is really descriptive about what work needs to be done. However, I would suggest them to properly structure the document. One finds it really difficult to understand the flow of the document.",1219815,1,8080
The UML diagrams clearly descibes the design of the solution. The screenshots explain changes required in the system adequately.,1219924,-1,8033
The design document is good and I don't think any design pattern needs to be followed as very few changes are being made. ,1219098,-1,8080
"The design makes use of the Google charts tool to generate visual charts for specific criteria set. Based on the design flow, it appears that the functionality can be consistently performed to generate the visual graph for the instructor.",1220454,-1,8080
"The visualization includes a screen mock-up ""Analyze""  button which will implement the algorithm and produce the output. However, there is no mock-up of the screen of what will the output be like. The flow diagram is highly redundant according to me, as it does not portray any additional information about the design. I would suggest them to provide a sequence diagram of the algorithm methods, so as to illustrate their changes.",1219712,1,8033
"Yes, the design appears to be sound and uses appropriate design principles.",1219228,-1,8080
Yes the design is pretty simple and inclusion of screenshot enhances the clarity of what the team has achieved in terms of the required changes. ,1220480,-1,8080
Design is simple and easy to understand.,1220545,-1,8080
Yes UML diagram is provided and it is detailed. Flow diagrams explains how suggestions will be given. ,1220110,-1,8033
"Yes, the design is simple and easy to understand. I can easily know what they will do through their doc.",1220660,-1,8080
The design appears to be very simple and well written. They have explained the use case diagram very well. also they have added visualizations.,1220675,-1,8080
"yes, the design is simple and easy to understand ",1219724,-1,8080
The team is using external tools to do the work and its clear and easy,1220261,-1,8080
"There is a test plan for part one of the problem state, however no implementation plan or test plan for part two.",1220477,1,8033
"The document is really simple to understand once you get to understand the flow. However, initially it appears to be difficult.",1219816,-1,8080
I think more tests can be added,1219298,-1,8033
Using google charts is a good idea.,1219598,1,8080
"Actual project work has not been started yet, so code modifications have not been mentioned yet. But the files to be changed seem appropriate for the project objective.",1219099,1,8080
"From the reasons provided for choosing the Google charts tool, and it's effectiveness, it can be integrated into the system functionality easily making the design simpler to be executed.",1220455,-1,8080
"Yes, design involves google charts API and seems very simple.",1219229,-1,8080
Yes the design flow and the screenshots very clearly describes the changes made to the system.,1220481,-1,8080
Flow diagram explains the flow correctly.,1220546,-1,8080
"Yes, they have used visualization to help people understand their design.",1220661,-1,8080
The bar charts have been added to the design report. The visualizations have been added to views also and the screen shots have been added too. The only thing that I would like to add is that the bar charts could have been more descriptive. As in they could have added details for  x label and y label and also put legend. this will aid the user in quickly understanding what the chart is conveying.  ,1220676,1,8080
They have worked on their weak point. Earlier their solution does not seem cogent but I would say now they have made good progress.,1219725,-1,8080
The sample data visualizations is good. The way they have given visualizations for sample data is nice. easier to understand and good.,1220262,-1,8080
"The document does include a flowchart which shows the flow of changes. However, an UML diagram would have made the document more understandable and easy to follow.",1219817,1,8080
The document mentions the detailed test case that needs to be done but not how it will be done.,1220091,1,8033
"The use cases appear to offer a quality, general test approach to see if their design does what it should.",1218931,-1,8033
Test cases have been added. ,1218752,-1,8033
The team already has mockups for their design.,1219599,-1,8080
"The visualization is great, the screenshots clearly indicate the proposed output of the project.",1219100,-1,8080
The team has included test plan in Connextra format by including the feature specification and two scenarios- one happy path and one to capture the edge case of response generated with no text. No more test cases can be added to check if the team's part in the project is implemented well. Some test case scenarios that check the efficiency of the suggestion detection algorithm (for example: to detect review responses that generate the generalized suggestion for all the projects) can be included.,1219331,1,8033
The team has not included any additional diagrams apart from the flow diagram provided in the first stage. The flow diagram effectively describes the sequence of actions that need to be taken so that the instructor can view the bar graph visual representation for the selected criteria set.,1220456,1,8080
Really good visualization provided.,1219230,-1,8080
Functionality features test has been included but plan for RSpec tests is yet to be included.,1220547,1,8080
"Yes, they did include the test plan, but it's not enough, if just including files.",1220662,0,8080
The project does not have any testing involved as such. But the authors have added a testing plan.,1220677,-1,8080
"According to the team ""The specification of the project does not require us to use automated tests"" but they plan to test the modified ruby code or the new features using the RSpec testing framework. Overall, the test  plan sounds good ",1219726,-1,8080
No tests are required for the project as stated,1220263,-1,8080
"The test plan section is included, however, only the framework to be used is discussed. I would suggest them to include a little more brief description about what test cases they plan to include and work on.",1219818,1,8080
This team did not require any tests.,1219600,-1,8080
The design document does not include a test plan as testing requirement is very minimal since most changes are in view.,1219101,1,8080
"The test plan section specifies that it does not require performing any automated tests. However, since the new functionality of adding a visual diagram, the team would modified ruby code for the functions added to the grades_controller.",1220457,-1,8080
"They have mentioned that they will be using Rspec framework, but have not given what tests they will be implementing and hence can not comment if tests will be shallow or not. ",1219231,1,8080
"The design document has incorporated test plans, but they haven't been explained neatly. Only the skeleton for the tests has been provided, they've should have at least added one actual test code for the reviewer to verify.",1220116,1,8033
"the tests given tests there changes, which is enough.",1219035,1,8033
The test plan is complete. The team plans to test the two possible cases:1. When the review is blank. Response should be no review in text box.2. When review is present response is the result of suggestion metrics analysis. The team is right in testing just these two cases because they should not test if the API itself is returning a correct response as that would be against testing rules.,1218911,-1,8033
Yes. Functional tests with scenarios provided.,1220111,-1,8033
the test cases seem appropriate given that the only thing which needs to be tested is if the suggestion detection algorithm is displaying the intended output or not.,1219201,1,8033
The design doc includes the test plan which covers changes in the functionalities.,1219925,-1,8033
"Their test plan includes a test case for successfully displaying the pop-up text message as JSON, and displaying suggestion metrics for the review segment( a block of review, a comment box). Try to include test cases where a review message is absent, i.e. the code should not break for empty review segment. Include a test case where review segment has a suggestion, and test if the output says ""Suggestion present"". Include a negative test case for the the suggestion, where a suggestion is not given by the reviewer, and test that the output says ""suggestion absent"".",1219713,1,8033
"Yes, the issues and the proposed solutions are clearly written.",1220678,-1,8028
Yes they have,1220102,-1,8028
"Yes, this is the best design I have reviewed. It has clearly explained the changes in steps. the formatting is great, and it's very well made with very good design details and objectives. It also included the current scenario and a typical score table. It should be great if there's an expected final outcome visualization as well.",1220172,-1,8028
Yes the authors have adequately described the changes required to be made to the system. The process has been divided into steps and each step describes changes in the MVC files. Good job,1220799,-1,8028
The problem and the changes needed is explained clearly,1220508,-1,8028
Yes. The design is clear and the details are succinct.,1219142,-1,8019
"I am not convinced with the ""similar_assignments"" table schema. For an assignment Ax, there is a foreign key that points to an assignment Ay such that Ax can be an assignment in say 2018 and Ay can be the same assignment in 2017. But what if one of the reviews from assignment Az which was in 2015 was really good and we need to include that as a sample and also include another review from Aw from 2016 as a sample.  According my understanding, this above requirement cannot be met with the current DB table design. Something that the team may look into.",1219143,1,8019
"The design looks simplified but there might be some edge cases that needs handling such as - What if a student makes his/her review public, this review is selected by the power user to create a sample and then the student wishes to make the review private?",1219144,-1,8019
There is one box for both review controller and assignment controller. A better picture of how they handle each event differently would have been helpful.,1219145,1,8019
"The test plan gives a black box testing view which is good and easy to understand. But it would be helpful to give more details about what functionalities are tested. Like a new DB table is added. So tests related to that and corner cases such as an old assignment gets removed , foreign key constraint so how will that test be conducted would make it better.",1219146,1,8019
Yes the approach is explained in detail.,1219273,-1,8019
The design is proper.,1219274,-1,8019
It is simple enough and also achieves the required features,1219275,-1,8019
The UML diagram is very good and makes understanding very easy,1219276,-1,8019
Yes the test plan section is again detailed with step by step instruction,1219277,-1,8019
"Team has explained the problem statement, approach to solve the issue well. Also the use case diagram explains design well.",1219541,-1,8019
"Yes, Design shows a good amount of work to be done. Team is not using any design pattern.  ",1219542,1,8019
Design doc is not complex and every section of the menu explains the itself with simplest term possible.,1219543,-1,8019
"The Use Case diagram added is drawn well and helps explaining the system. Team could have added, screenshots of the Expertiza pages, that would have helped us understand whoch part of the system is changing well.",1219544,1,8019
Team has added manual testing under test plan. Team should also add automated test cases or brief plan on how they are going forward with automated testing of the changes.,1219545,1,8019
Very basic explanation,1219611,-1,8019
Simple design,1219613,-1,8019
No visualization,1219614,1,8019
  The team has well explained the changes which are required to be made in the system. They have broken the explanation of the details of the requirement in simple bullet points which makes it very easy to understand the change requested. The design approach ,1220618,-1,8019
"The team has stated all the changes they are planning to make step wise in detail. This really helps to understand the approach they are taking in simple terms. However, the team has not stated which design principle they are following.",1220619,1,8019
"The steps taken by the team to implement the functionality is very clear and detailed. as stated above, the approach discusses the  step wise action that the team is going to take for the implementation.",1220620,-1,8019
"The team has represented the workflow through the UML diagrams which is very helpful to understand the flow of the requirement with multiple actors involved in the system. However, it would have been more helpful if they could add the design flow diagrams to explain the database design changes they are suggesting to be done. The new table they are suggesting to make and  the fields they would map to could be shown through a entity relationship diagram which will make it easy for the end user to understand the attributes and the relationship of different entities involved due to the functionality change.",1220621,1,8019
The team has come up with a very detailed and clear step wise test plan for all the actors involved. They have done great work to depict the flow for every user which makes sure they are handling all the scenarios. This also suggests their approach is behavior driven. They have done great job in this and the test are in depth.,1220622,-1,8019
"While I'm awaiting to receive the details which are pending on the implementation, I feel the general nature of the changes is well-explained. ",1219087,-1,8019
"Confronted with a tricky problem in creating links between different assignments across semesters to aggregate the reviews, I was really impressed with the way they plan to accomplish this feature.",1219088,-1,8019
"I like the Use Case Diagram, but I would like class diagrams or a database visualization too, so it's easier to understand how the cross-course assignment linking will work.",1219090,-1,8019
"The test plan is very detailed, but doesn't account for what I suspect could be many edge cases.",1219091,1,8019
some mock UI where this is going to be implemented would be helpful,1219340,1,8019
some more test cases would be useful,1219341,1,8019
The team has not used any class diagram.,1219832,0,8019
Detailed test plan (+1),1219833,-1,8019
The authors have adequately mentioned the desired changes in the approach and design section. The problem statement gives the gist of the issue at hand including adding feature to make student's reviews public. The proposals specified are effective to deal with the issue by creating a new MVC framework.,1220653,-1,8019
The design and fixes are coherently described and are logical to be implemented for the given functionality. The issues are stated properly allowing the reader to understand it and the fixes suggested are enlisted in an appropriate manner.,1220654,-1,8019
The design makes it clear to understand the procedure adapted to realize the goal. The authors have made it a point to describe the tasks carried out in a simpler manner allowing the reader to realize the approach towards the issue. ,1220655,-1,8019
The UML Use Case diagram takes into consideration the system specifications and the manner in which the users interact with each other in the process. It makes it easy to analyze how the implementation can take place in the current scenario. ,1220656,-1,8019
The test plan section properly describes the flow that needs to be followed by each actor involved in the process. This could be enhanced either by providing a flow diagram or adding certain test case snippets for the scenarios.,1220657,-1,8019
"The overall design looks good. However, the author can add more details about the design principles being followed and appropriate patterns to be used.",1220684,0,8019
"I think the design perfectly captures the view part. They have also incorporated the db related changes after the first review. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of depth of details provided in the doc",1220683,1,8019
The design seems pretty simple and straightforward. ,1220685,-1,8019
I think the UML diagram can be improved further by adding the classes that are related to the use cases separately.  ,1220686,1,8019
"The Test plan seems to be covering most of the positive test cases. However, it doesn't seem to cover any negative test cases. Like if the student decides not to make the review public, its reviews shouldn't be shown to the TA/ Instructor.",1220687,1,8019
Yes the Problem Statement and Design Approach sections explain clearly what the usecase is and what the authors think will be a good design to implement.The changes are clearly explained. Having some file names would be useful to review in detail.,1220458,1,8019
"Yes based on the explanation given, the design seems appropriate and will achieve the desired end-results. Good Job !",1220459,-1,8019
The design is concised and clear. Only makes the required changes and introduces no duplications.,1220460,-1,8019
The usecase diagram is helpful but does not help much as it just explains what is provided in the approach section. More in-depth functionality of what each user will do or how will the design flow (flow chart) would be more helpful.,1220461,1,8019
Test Plan is explained in detail. It covers Integration Testing and Functional checks. However some unit testing of the new models should also be covered.,1220462,1,8019
"Yes, they explained a lot with two steps.",1218922,-1,8028
I really loved the way that the authors have provided a detailed proposed plan section making it very clear about the changes that are required to be made in order to tackle the given problem statement.,1218758,-1,8028
The documentation is somewhat ambiguous,1219495,1,8028
"The authors have described 1-2 solutions of the problem. However, I would suggest them to include more about how these changes will be done and where are these changes going to occur, what files will be affected etc.",1219876,1,8028
"All problem statements have been explained, this time including an elaborate test plan.",1220264,-1,8028
"The design is ambiguous. The team only said they will make ""some"" changes to the current system but didn't state clearly what kind of changes they will make and how these changes will be done. For example, for the first step, we need more information about how the team will change the UI, the model and the controller or helper to realize what the team said.",1219362,1,8028
"Yes, the author explained the plan clearly. The steps and the files need to be modified are listed.",1218723,-1,8028
"As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.",1220679,-1,8028
Yes it looks sound,1220103,-1,8028
"The  design is sound. It completely follows the instructions. It also has detailed implemenation plan in each steps. I think it follows the DRY principle, because it uses existing implementations, fully understood the existing implementations, and added the functions above. I think it should also follow the factory pattern, although not shown in the design doc.",1220173,-1,8028
Yes the system is well designed and the UI looks neat as well. They have put effort into the UI thinking process.,1220800,-1,8028
"Although the design provided is clear, there might be some more work needed to optimize it properly and make it work as intended. ",1220509,-1,8028
"I can't find any explanation for principles and patterns, maybe the authors should add them to wiki.",1218923,1,8028
The design appears to be sound and seems to follow all the appropriate principles as far as I am concerned. And as mentioned earlier I would again like to point out that the proposed plan section has been handled really well.,1218759,-1,8028
The document is very well structured and is quite easy to follow. They have explained each and everything stepwise.,1219877,-1,8028
It seems the authors didn't have a clear and detailed plan about how to change the current system to meet the requirement. They got the direction to do the project but still lacked details to implement it.,1219363,1,8028
"Yes, the design seems appropriate and suitable for the case. Maybe the author could specify the patterns they use in the document.",1218724,-1,8028
"Yes, simple straightforward solutions.",1220680,-1,8028
the design is simple,1220104,-1,8028
The design is both simple and clear. It should be better to add another step for the comparison of the instructor review and the student review. Both as a final examination and a testing.,1220174,-1,8028
"Yes the design is as simple as possible. However they have only described the proposed design. They could have provided simple mock ups or samples,",1220801,-1,8028
"The approach is clear, but is not clear as to what changes will be needed in the system.",1220510,1,8028
"Yes, pretty simple. Great job!",1218924,-1,8028
"The design appears to be simple to the best of my knowledge. Not a lot of files needed to be changed, signifying that they are just targeting specific files in order to make minimum number of changes possible not making it too complex.",1218760,-1,8028
"The document is well explained. Thus, it reduces complexity and makes itself appear quite easy for the user to understand. However, more diagrams and flowcharts would have helped even more.",1219878,-1,8028
"The design is as simple as possible, and described in a straightforward manner.",1220266,-1,8028
"Actually,, the design seems not simple. Due to the ambiguous of the design, I cannot tell clearly what the four links are used to do in the first step, but it seems too many links will be used and some strange conditions need to be checked before instructors can perform a review. In addition, it seems not all the instructors can do the reviews, so there may be some errors? Description for step 2 is also complex and seems include a lot of jobs need to do.",1219364,1,8028
The design seems simple and feasible.,1218725,-1,8028
Necessary visual inputs are present to aid explanation.,1220681,-1,8028
"Yes, appropriate visual cue is present in the form of screen shots",1220105,-1,8028
"The diagram only stated the current scenario.. There's no final picture, no UML diagram. The figure didn't clearly describe the changes to be made to the system. It should be better if there's a UML diagram from the user practice side, a diagram for the design plan, and also another figure for the final picture: how dows it look like when the plan is implemented.",1220175,1,8028
"No, the proposed UI changes are only mentioned and the diagrams in the wiki are of the current system. Use draw.io for mockups and drawings.",1220802,1,8028
Team has used screenshots to show the current scenario but any flowcharts/UML to describe how they are solving the problem is missing. Adding these will make the document easier for anyone not familiar the project understand it better,1220511,1,8028
Excellent use of visualizations!,1219335,1,8028
No diagrams present,1219498,1,8028
There are no UML diagrams. I would suggest them to include a test case diagram that can improve understandability.,1219879,1,8028
"There are visual aids included with the design, depicting the current state of the system as well as proposed icons to institute the design changes.",1220267,-1,8028
The design lacks diagrams to state what the changes they will do and how it will be like after change. It is difficult to image how the system will be like after change and what will be changed.,1219365,1,8028
The authors provide some screenshots which make their project more clear. It would be better if they provide more diagrams to explain their solutions.,1218726,-1,8028
"I see test cases properly defined, but the test plan is missing.",1220682,-1,8028
Yes the test plan is included.I think the tests will cover all scenarios,1220106,-1,8028
"There is a test plan, the tests are deep and detailed. However, the current test plan is not enough to test the functionalities. They are just unit tests. It should be added with a tests that directed tests whether the instructor can do the same kind of review as the students, from the user 's perspective (for example, log in, do the review, etc)",1220176,1,8028
The testing appears to be pretty rigorous. They have taken into account cases when TA/instructor's scores should be excluded. The test cases could have been better described.,1220803,-1,8028
Team has done a good job in identifying the cases that needs to be tested. It will be an improvement if they can add details on how they plan to test each controller/view separately.,1220512,-1,8028
"Yes, there is a detailed test plan for this project. Not only basic features testing but also other more testing.",1218926,-1,8028
The test plan looks really thorough covering all the possible scenarios. I am personally happy with the given test-plan.,1218762,-1,8028
"Yes, the authors have significantly improved the writeup, and very adequately explained the changes that they've made.",1219774,-1,8021
"Yes, the changes are well explained. There are a lot of pictures, snipped screen shots to help explain the changes to be made. There's one issue that the screenshots are not very clear, since it's big. It would look better of the screenshots can be clearer.",1218962,1,8021
The wiki is detailed enough that it mentions all the functionalities required in the project. The team has made sure to explain all the changes they wish to make to the system. They list all columns that need to be sorted and how they will implement the sorting.,1219911,1,8021
"The authors have explained the changes to be made to the system, including screenshots of the tables, UML diagrams as well as all the files that will be modified. Suggestion: Although all the details are explained well in the document, by writing the changes proposed to the files in bullet points or by using a diagram the document will be easier to read.",1220167,-1,8021
The authors have explained enough about the changes,1220279,-1,8021
"The team has added uml diagrams, images of related web pages and provided details on jQuery tablesorter that explains well the changes the team plans to make.",1219172,-1,8021
Great improvements compared to the previous submission. Now its a Very well written document. Good job team.,1220633,-1,8021
"The authors have explained about their changes neatly, including previous suggestions. They have added detailed description about tablesorter which they plan to implement. The tablesorter is used to sort data for multiple fields for a table, using multi-tbody sorting. They plan to use it in the grades and review_mapping views. They do not plan to implement in their drop-down, but display the sorted data itself on loading the page.  The changes look more clear to me, as they have been able to implement the changes in the table view using multi-tbody sorting for submissions table. I think that introduction to Expertiza is highly unnecessary and should be removed,",1219551,1,8021
"The design document clearly specifies all the issues that are going to be addressed by this project. UI views are provided which help the reader to better understand the scope of the requirements. Moreover, the authors list the files that are going to be modified and the authors comprehensively describe how the jQuery tablesorter 2.0 library will be used for three types of sorting. One minor improvement would be to highlight the parts associated with introduced changes that link html table with the library for better readability.",1218865,1,8021
"   Yes, the team has elaborated their design approach and changes to system in detail. They have mentioned all the file changes and also provided sample code for reader understanding.",1218982,-1,8021
"They made clear explanation about their task. For example, their provide pictures to show what they need to do.  ",1217188,-1,8021
The design is very efficient and follows the standardized software engineering practices. ,1219775,-1,8021
"The design is sound because it has plans of file modification, of implemented solution, and very detailed testing plan. The DRY principle might not be well followed, since in each testing, the tester needs to log in as a super_administrator2 again. And there are five testings. ",1218963,1,8021
"the design is sound and easy to understand. The design proposed also sounds logical, i.e to sort team names alphabetically, and grades numerically. To sort by both ascending and descending order.",1219912,-1,8021
"Yes, the design seems to be sound.",1220168,-1,8021
The authors have justified the use of jQuery table sorter by listing its advantages.,1219173,-1,8021
The team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made. the design looks good and easy to implement. ,1220634,-1,8021
"The design appears to be specific to the requirements. For this, they have used a UML design which basically explains the flow of the use-case. They have not used any principles or design patterns. However, there does not seem a need to use any, as their changes are limited to the html view and making a call to the tablesorter using JQuery. As per the document, the design does not make any redundant changes or unnecessary changes to the code. Thus, they have done a good job by optimizing the changes.",1219552,1,8021
"The authors have improved the part of the document that describes the interactions between html and javascript parts since the 1st round. While this assignment does not require an extensive discussion about the design principles or patterns, it would be better if the document explicitly addressed this topic.",1218866,1,8021
"Yes, as its sorting, not much scope on design approach. Yet the team has documented well on their approach regarding multi-level sortings that they are undertaking in few pages. They have also considered cross-browser compatibility of their jQuery library, which is a common design miss during client-side changes.",1218983,1,8021
"This project is not very difficult, so they don't need to follow some principles or patterns.",1217189,-1,8021
"Yes, the design is very simple to understand, and also the implementation is pretty clear and effective.",1219776,-1,8021
"yes, the design is the simplest I could think about. But it doesn't include how to change the files.  I think it can still be as simple and succinct if the modifications of files can be included. On the other hand, the expected result seems to be too long. There's too many screenshots",1218964,1,8021
The design is extremely simple and easy to understand. Good work guys :),1219913,-1,8021
"Yes, the solution proposed is simple by using the  jQuery tablesorter gem.",1220169,-1,8021
The use of jQuery plugin sounds simple and easy to use.,1219174,-1,8021
The design looks simple and clear.,1220635,-1,8021
"Yes, the design is as simple as it can be. The current scenario is explained with adequate screenshots, and the changes are explained by stating the field to be used for sorting the table. A mock-up screen of the expected output would have made it even better to understand, however reading the material is sufficient as well. The changes are not complex, as they interact with a single view at a time. The tablesorter function is also called for each view, e.g. view_submissions layout.",1219553,1,8021
"The modifications that are suggested by the team are minimalistic and cover the changes that are necessary for the javascript library to work. While it is possible to infer the majority of changes that will be introduced in this project, it would be better if the authors elaborated on the implementation of all the views as opposed to discussing only the ""view submissions"" table. ",1218867,-1,8021
"The design is simple, they are adding an external JQuery library to achieve the intended sorting functionality and will be adding custom js to achieve further functionalities. As indicated earlier, not clear as to this custom js will be included in multiple pages.",1218984,1,8021
This their design is very simple and clear.,1217190,-1,8021
"This part has been significantly improved from the previous submission. The diagram make it very easy for an outsider to understand the architecture, the underlying problems and the proposed solution. ",1219777,-1,8021
"The screenshots of the expected result and the UML diagram are good, But the screenshots can be smaller to make the page more user-friendly. The UML diagram can be better if it's designed as a design plan diagram instead of a user diagram, which simply states how the reader is to approach this. Or it could be better if we have both.",1218965,1,8021
Yes. The figures added to the wiki clearly indicate the changes that will be made to each view. The columns that will be made sortable and how will the made sortable. Good work :),1219914,-1,8021
The flowchart added gives a good idea of the final outcome after implementation of the changes proposed. Suggestion: A diagram explaining the plan of changes to be made will make the document easier to read.,1220170,-1,8021
"Yes, the team added visual aids like UML diagrams, screen shots, code snippets to clearly describe the changes to be made to the system. Well done!",1219175,1,8021
This team used great diagrams that add to their documentation's clarity significantly.,1220636,-1,8021
"The authors have included a UML diagram which explains a flow of the diagram The document does not strike a balance in the use of visualization. It lacks at illustrating the changes using appropriate use-cases, mock-up screens to show the expected changes as opposed to the current scenario. The mock-up screen can include sorted values of the field whose headers you clicked upon. Also, there is no need of other visualization aids such as class diagrams, as the modifications are limited to views. ",1219554,1,8021
"There are multiple visual elements that improve the readability of the document. Screenshots of the UI tables help with the illustration of the required changes. Furthermore, the UML diagram demonstrates the relation between relevant flows.",1218868,-1,8021
The team has added good number of mock UIs and UML diagram and clearly explains the code follow. All of them are self-explanatory and needs no improvement,1218985,-1,8021
diagram is added. ,1220466,-1,8021
No visulization is necessary for this project,1217191,-1,8021
"Yes, the team has made a very good testing plan, consisting of functional testing, which covers almost all of the use cases which have been added/modified. However, the author could have added code snippets of the same, instead of just discussing the proposed plan.",1219778,1,8021
"Yes, the design includes a very good test plan. The tests are deep and detailed and completely test the functionalitys. But I think it could be better following the DRY principle if the tester don't need to log in as administrator2 every time.",1218966,1,8021
You have a lot of testing scenarios which is really good,1218890,-1,8021
"I suggest the testing plan be improved. In place of giving steps on how a reviewer should test the project, the team should instead list how they wish to write tests for the functionality added. The rspec could be something like expect(page).to have_content(sorted)",1219915,-1,8021
The design doc includes the test plan which covers all the changes that will be made.,1220171,-1,8021
There is a detail explanation on how the function testing will be carried out under the teating plan section of the wiki doc.,1219176,-1,8021
Yes it includes test plan. It is very well written and will test the functionalities.,1220637,-1,8021
"Test plans looks to be an overview of the functionality, In the test plan i see the functionalities explained l",1219990,-1,8021
"  The test plan has covered test cases for testing functionalities of sorting submissions table and review mappings per field. They can also include test plan for the edge cases of the system, like the code should not break when the submissions table is empty and show should probably display a flash message saying ""no entries to be sorted!"". In this way, try to add a few negative testing to improve your coverage. This will make your code more rigid.",1219555,1,8021
"The test plan is present. It consists of a set of functional tests described for each of the five views. I would suggest elaborating on the technical side of tests, for example specifying which spec files will be modified or whether or not the project will utilize RSpec. Moreover, it would be better if the team provided a rationale for why it is sufficient to use only functional tests.",1218869,-1,8021
"The test plan is complete and covers all intended functionalities. They have also provided all necessary steps to test the functionality. Good documentation on test plan. As client-side changes using script is added, a latency test to verify system is not slow in responding to sorting can be included.",1218986,1,8021
the test plan is thorough. ,1220467,-1,8021
"Yes, they had test plan, but only simple test plan, they should add some more corner cases.",1217192,1,8021
They have discussed clearly what functionalities they are going to test to make the project more efficient. I think they have made a quite descent research in the testing aspect of the project.,1219880,-1,8028
The design includes the test plan.,1220268,-1,8028
"The test plan is shallow. It only state what features the team will test but how the features will be test, what and how many cases will be included are not clear. The team should expand the plan for each features they aim to test, including specific steps and different cases.",1219366,1,8028
"Yes, the test plan looks good. The author lists all the cases they need to test.",1218727,-1,8028
Yes. The authors have made changes to the design document and are more specific about how exactly they plan to implement the new functionality.,1220503,-1,8029
"The team has mentioned properly what changes they are doing and how they will be doing them. In the first submission they had suggested the possible approaches. Now, they are having a concrete way they are implementing these changes.",1219556,-1,8029
"Yes, and at times, much more than necessary! ",1219732,-1,8029
No changes has been done,1219284,-1,8029
"Yes, they explained a lot for the changes. Great job!",1219576,-1,8029
" The authors have done good job explaining the changes to be made to the system, and even explaining why other, more obvious options, are not chosen. It still sounds like a complicated change to make to the system.",1219112,-1,8029
The team added more information from the last time which aided in a better explanation of the problem. Good job team,1220339,-1,8029
1) The authors have adequately explained the changes to be made to the design document.,1220047,-1,8029
"The team has very well explained the changes they are making in the project to achieve the functionality. However, they have not included any design explanation explicitly. They have not described the approach they have come with. It might be helpful if they could add the design approach as well in the wiki link so that its easier to understand the code changes by having a glance at the design pattern.",1220897,1,8023
"The explanations are more than sufficient. Not only have the authors explained the changes to the system, but also explained the reasoning for considering those changes. I like the way that they also explained the other different ways they could've integrated the GitHub metrics but avoided those methods with sufficient reasoning for the same.The team has also given an explanation of their database design modifications would be like which is good.",1218733,-1,8029
The authors have dived into the depths when explaining the changes. All of the changes are well defined and precise.,1219601,-1,8023
"Yes , excellent work done by the team. The design document adequately explains what is the problem that they are trying to solve, what is the proposed solution and how the solution would look like.  There are enough details to in the document to understand what is being done and what changes are proposed. The document also has enough illustrations on what is the current situation. ",1220001,-1,8029
"Yes, they did.",1217237,-1,8023
The authors adequately explained the changes they plan to make.,1219699,-1,8029
Yes,1219733,-1,8029
The technical changes required are explained in depth but the usecase or the domain knowledge is not provides properly. This makes it difficult to understand the problem statement properly. Some high-level domain knowledge and requirements background will be helpful.,1220448,1,8023
"The authors have very well explained the problem statement and the changes to be made to the system, including flowcharts, the files to be modified/added and useful links.",1220177,-1,8023
Authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system. The design document was easy to understand.,1220573,-1,8023
"The team is going to improve compatibility with web content that relies on the WebAudio API by implementing missing pieces of incomplete node types (OscillatorNode) along with entire missing nodes (ConstantSourceNode, StereoPannerNode, IIRFilterNode). ",1219743,-1,8023
"Yes, they made detailed explanation about their changes.",1217406,-1,8023
"The team has very well explained the changes they are making in the project to achieve the functionality. However, they have not included any design explanation explicitly. They have not described the approach they have come with. It might be helpful if they could add the design approach as well in the wiki link so that its easier to understand the code changes by having a glance at the design pattern.",1220898,1,8023
The design seems to be flawless. All the principles and patterns used are flawless and to the point.,1219602,-1,8023
"Yep, they have good structure to show what and how they gonna do with the project",1217238,-1,8023
The design looks good. The code is already committed and approved by the concerned team. Good Job !,1220449,-1,8023
"Yes, their design appears to be sound.",1220178,-1,8023
The design appears to be sound and following appropriate principles.,1220574,-1,8023
The design seems to be sound. They have a sample design where they are explaining the tables and how they plan to work with them as well. The examples provided help understand how the data will be stored.,1219557,-1,8029
Yes. The team intends to use grade_controller to show github metric which would be a good place to implement this functionality. The idea to involve instructors because of a 60 requests/hour limit may complicate the project. Another idea would be to update metrics with a round robin scheduling of GET requests. ,1220504,1,8029
Yes,1219285,-1,8029
"Yes, they included some design principles, which is good. Maybe the authors could add some design patterns into wiki.",1219577,1,8029
"yeah, Their proposed design includes workflow, initial step, and subsequent steps. It was easy to follow their design. Their solution appears to be sound.",1219744,-1,8023
"I don't exactly understand how the waveforms help to produce the sound for the new browser they're adding support for, but other than that, their approach seems solid.",1219572,1,8023
"Yes, I am surprised that they have already finished the project. ",1217407,-1,8023
 The design appears to be sound. They have weighed their options and are using an official gem to interact with the github api.,1219113,-1,8029
I don't see any issue in the design document. They have followed a good design principle.,1220340,-1,8029
1) The authors have mentioned several approaches in which these functionalities could be implemented. 2) Their chosen approach is follows MVC architecture and DRY principles.,1220048,-1,8029
"The design appears to be sound for most part of it. The linking between the different sections seems appropriate. The only issue I have is with the mock-up in the Design Details -> Second Change mock-up number 2. I think that the bar chart is being displayed for each and every day. I feel that is not only highly unnecessary but also would be very overwhelming for the instructor to process all this information because:-i) It is common knowledge that many students do not begin projects until a few days/weeks would have passed since the assignment is posted. So that would leave the initial few days of the bar chart empty with nothing valuable to show.ii) The duration of each project varies from project to project. Assignment 2 had a duration of about 20 -30 days. This would mean that there would be about 20 bar charts for each day which would be quite difficult for the TA/instructor to process for just one team let alone for so many other teams they need to evaluate. Suggestions: Instead of providing bar chart for each day aggregate it to a bar chart for each week or one in 5 days. And then maybe towards the deadline or like a week before the deadline you could switch to 1 barchart per day. OR Provide an option to switch between the scaling of time periods like a week, 5 days, 1 day etc.",1218734,1,8029
"Yes, the github api integration looks good. the only part missing was perhaps they could have documented the rest calls that they are going to make in the document as well. Usage of existing gems is good and eases lot of implementation pains  ",1220002,1,8029
"As stated above, the team has not explained any design pattern they are following. However they have mentioned all the code changes they are making for this functionality implementation. The code snippets they have included is very useful to understand the exact code changes they are making and the files which are getting impacted. This would help the future developers to understand the  code in a simple manner.",1220899,1,8023
 The design sound very reasonable.  ,1219700,-1,8029
The design is concise and clear.,1219603,-1,8023
Yes,1219286,-1,8029
Actually they may include too much info. which could be replaced by some links.,1217239,1,8023
"The design is concise and clear. They have added reference images of how the system would look after their changes, which properly shows the expected implementation results.",1219558,-1,8029
Yes. It is thoroughly investigated.,1219734,-1,8029
The design is simple and easy to understand. The sin waves and the description about it helps to properly understand the changes made and its impact.,1220450,-1,8023
The idea to involve instructors because of a 60 requests/hour limit may complicate the project. Another idea would be to update metrics with a round robin scheduling of GET requests. ,1220505,1,8029
The design was not unnecessarily complex. It was as easy as it could be.,1220575,-1,8023
"Their design is much simple and clear, also easy to understand.",1219578,-1,8029
"Yeah, I believe it is as simple as possible while choosing the best path for the expertiza project to grow, but it still sounds like a very ambitious project for 1 group to complete.",1219114,-1,8029
Use of flowcharts and step by step explanation simplified their solution. It was easy to grasp and design also appears to be simple.,1219745,-1,8023
Very simple and clear.,1217408,-1,8023
"With proper documentation, the problem is explained nicely and understanding of the complex problem is made easier.",1220341,-1,8029
1) Have clearly mentioned when will GitHub Api be hit to retrive the data and which gem will be used.,1220049,-1,8029
 Their design is simple and clear.  ,1219701,-1,8029
The team has done tremendous job in adding visualization aids. They have added application flow diagrams and visualized images. They have also included screenshots to explain the code functionality implementation of enabling self reviews and score pages. This makes the document descriptive and very easy to read and understand.  ,1220900,-1,8023
Self explanatory visual changes have been added. All the changes are described via the visual aids.,1219604,-1,8023
"They only presents a flow chart, it will be better if there is a UML diagram.",1217240,1,8023
Yes the flow diagram and graph plots help to understand the changes and its implications. The diagrams clearly describe the change approach followed.,1220451,-1,8023
The flowcharts included in the design document clearly explain the changes that need to be done.,1220180,-1,8023
The design document includes proper visualization. It included appropriate flow charts and screenshots which made it easier to understand the design document and the project.,1220576,-1,8023
"Yes, the team has used flowcharts and diagrams which clearly describe the changes to be made to the system.",1219746,-1,8023
They provide pictures of their sound waves.,1217409,-1,8023
"Yes, the authors are using already existing gems for the implementation. I would have liked to see a section on caching if any.  Rest the solution proposed looks simple and straightforward and looks that it will easily integrate into the current system  ",1220003,-1,8029
The design appears to be fairly simple. I think however there will be difficulty in implementing the GitHub metrics for latest data vs data before the submission deadlines.,1218735,1,8029
The provided tests are in depth and will test the changes made thoroughly.,1219605,-1,8023
They have pretty good test plan as there is no code yet.,1217241,-1,8023
The use case diagram properly shows how the addition of this feature will help for the instructor role.,1219559,-1,8029
The visualizations used by the team are comprehensive and well made.,1220506,-1,8029
Good design,1219287,-1,8029
"This is a mozilla project and I am not sure what are the testing requirements and depth to be covered, as it is not mentioned in the document. But the steps mentioned do suggest that basic testing id done",1220452,1,8023
"excellent use of screenshots, made things very clear for me.",1219322,-1,8029
"Yes, they use a lot of diagrams to show use case.",1219579,-1,8029
"Yes, the design includes a test plan. I think the tests can be more descriptive, including 'what' is being tested and in 'which scenario' the test is being implemented.",1220181,1,8023
 The photos included are superb at showing the expected View.  They can have more 1 or 2 more stars if most of the Expteriza work for the github metrics was already completed when they made these screen shots. Do you think it is feasible to expect that you can start a software project before getting a green light on the project in order to include high quality pictures of your proposed View in action?,1219115,-1,8029
Use case diagram is present but it would have been nice to see a sequence diagram to understand the flow. ,1220342,1,8029
It included a proper test plan. There was no test plan included in the previous version of the design document but authors have added it in the second round which made the design document complete.,1220577,-1,8023
Explains the different approaches with the help of use case diagram.,1220050,-1,8029
the design does include test plan and plans to test the functionalities ,1219747,-1,8023
"The use case diagram appears to be slightly incorrect. The symbol for an should be a stick figure not a rectangle. But that is a minor error. Also, the Use Case Diagram Details mention student as an actor but the diagram shows no instance of student as an actor. I think the Student as an actor shouldn't be included because in the current use case only the instructor is the primary actor and the assignment should have been submitted by the time the instructor views the scores, thus, requiring no involvement from the students at that point in time.Mention of Primary sequence in the Use Case Diagram Details seems highly unnecessary and potentially unrelated.",1218736,1,8029
There are enough aids such as uml diagrams and screen shots. The authors explicitly mention that there are no db changes so no need of an er diagram. Although I would have liked some class level details to be mentioned in the document that would help to dig more about the design changes,1220004,1,8029
I feel the test plan should be more descriptive while also covering a few edge cases.,1219895,1,8023
 They not only use use case diagram but also mock-up screenshot to help the reader understand their design.  ,1219702,-1,8029
The test plan does include a high level of testing scenarios the team plans to cover. I would suggest the team should add BDD tests so they can test the same after the development phase is over.,1219560,1,8029
"The test plan doesn't seem to explain how the team intends to test their new implementation, it simply gives directions for running tests.",1219575,1,8023
"The test plan seems adequate at this stage, edge cases may need to be considered at a later stage.",1220507,1,8029
"They have Test plan, but I don't think they include test in it, they just put some examples about how to run their code.  ",1217410,1,8023
No,1219288,-1,8029
few more test cases can be added,1219323,1,8029
"Yes, it includes the test plan with a great detail.",1219580,-1,8029
Few test plan is written. The team can add more test plan.,1220343,1,8029
The design includes a test plan. However the test plan has nothing related to tests or which test cases are going to be considered. It just explains the flow of how an instructor would reach the GitHub metrics data page.The team should at least mention which files are the test cases going to be written on and what functionalities are they going to test.,1218737,1,8029
Good test plan. Should include more test cases that check the functionality of GitHub integration. eg: If number of lines of code committed by a student is correctly computed.,1220051,-1,8029
"The test section looks inadequate as of now, only two test scenarios are mentioned and no details on automation or UI.  More so no mention of tests in the document.",1220005,1,8029
 Test plans for both of their subtasks were present.  ,1219703,-1,8029
"Yes, the authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system. Document is simple, succinct and easy to understand. Great use of flow charts, uml diagrams and mockups to visually represent the information is done. ",1219531,-1,8016
"The document provided by the team is very detailed and includes all the requirements which are suggested by the Change Request. However, the team may change tone of the document as it is instructive  right now which seems like the change request description itself. The team might also add a wiki link for this document so that it could be included in the expertiza links of existing and ongoing changes and would be more reachable to a wider audience.",1220779,1,8016
 Yes the author has provided a sufficient explanation of what changes needs to be done to the system by giving flow diagrams and screenshots about what changes they are going to incorporate in their system,1220438,-1,8016
Team has added all the diagrams and screenshots. The document is well explained and looks complete.,1220403,-1,8016
"Yes, their explanations are adequately explained the changes.",1220638,-1,8016
1) The authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system. 2) They also have given the files to be modified/added for each change.  ,1220006,-1,8016
Authors have clearly explained all the changes to be made and where to make them. The design document is quite clear and easy to understand.,1220558,-1,8016
I think that the authors have done a really good job of explaining and covering all the changes to be made. Overall this is the best document i have seen so far.,1218778,-1,8016
The authors have explained all the changes to be made very clearly and concisely. Each change is supplemented with sufficient diagrams and mock-ups so as to make the final task of visualization easier.,1218917,-1,8016
The document seems complete,1219485,-1,8016
Yes the authors have tried to explain what changes are required and what they plan to do however I feel that exact changes that they might be doing are missing. They could have listed most files that will need modification and if necessary new files that will be changed,1219971,1,8016
"Yes, one of the best design docs of project 4!",1219946,-1,8016
"The document was very well written previously too, and they have improved it with diagrams and test. Nice work.",1219192,-1,8016
The authors have considerably improved on the document. UML diagrams as requested have been added.,1220804,-1,8016
"Yes, the design follows appropriate principles and patterns. suggestions: not required.",1219532,-1,8016
"The team has very well explained the steps they have planned to take for implementation of the functionality. They have stated every change they would be making for the Change request in details. They have also provided flow diagram for every actor involved and for every functionality they are going to implement.  However, the team has not explicitly mentioned the design pattern they are following for this implementation.",1220780,1,8016
" As the project is based upon making changes to the UI of the system , thus there is no such specific pattern being followed however the design that they have made available in the form of screenshots appear very much inclined with the functionalities that they need to implement .",1220439,-1,8016
Design is good,1220404,-1,8016
"Yes, their design is very sound, and principles and patterns are used appropriately.",1220639,-1,8016
"1) The design appears to be sound. 2) Also follows proper design principles eg: for making changes to nomination and review questions, inheritance is used (inheriting methods from questions parent class)",1220007,-1,8016
The design seems to be appropriate and sound. It follows appropriate principles.,1220559,-1,8016
"Yes, the design appears to be very sound and follows all the principles that I know. I loved the format of the documentation as well.",1218779,-1,8016
" The design seems to be sound. There are a lot of mention of which files will be modified however, as I said in the previous round, there is no mention of the layout of the existing database or if the changes they will make currently will change the database. Suggestion: Team could mention what tables are present in the database of the Bacui project. I believe this will be really helpful since most of the reviewers are working on Expertiza projects and have no knowledge of Bacui projects. At the very least the team could mention which tables the project will be interacting with along with their structure.",1218918,1,8016
They have explained very well,1219486,-1,8016
Yes the design follows simple rails concepts and is pretty straightforward. I would like to see if the team uses existing gems available to speed up implementation and re use.   ,1219972,-1,8016
"Yes, looks clean. Any design patterns used????",1219947,-1,8016
"Yes, the design appears to be sound and well made. ",1219193,-1,8016
"Yes, the design appears to be sound. There could be some rearrangement in the mock-up layout, e.g. text box for email address and 'Add' button could have the same horizontal alignment for a better user interface.",1220805,-1,8016
The design seems to be very simple. I think the team has avoided unnecessary complications and are doing minimal changes to existing system to solve issues given to them.,1219533,-1,8016
The design approach seems justified and inline with the functionalities required to be implemented. They have mentioned step wise details for all the changes they are going to take. Done a good job. No rework required.,1220781,-1,8016
" Yes the design is presented in a much simpler form which gives a very clear picture of how the changes are going to be implemented and which functionalities would be witnessing the changes , also as they have provide the screenshots it enhances the understanding about the project more.",1220440,-1,8016
"Yes, their design is simple and clear enough to read and understand.",1220640,-1,8016
1) The design is simple and well modularized. 2) Each method is implementing only one task as it should.,1220008,-1,8016
The design does appear to be as simple as possible. The team have not unnecessarily complicated the project.,1220560,-1,8016
"Yes, the design is pretty simple and to the point. The design proposed is very clear and talk why each change is necessary.",1218780,-1,8016
 The design is straightforward and as simple as possible. The team has thought this project out very clearly and laid the same in the form of flowcharts and mock-ups. This has greatly reduced the complexity of the project and helped decrease the chances of clutter and confusion.,1218919,-1,8016
"Yes, adequate amount of details present",1219487,-1,8016
"Yes the design looks simple. The use of mock up screens is good and greatly helps understand the flow that has been proposed. Good work! How ever in one of the flow charts the check for ""Is Admin"" does not show/label  ""Y"" or ""N"" path",1219973,1,8016
Yes!  The requirements are simple and the design plan clearly explains all the points.,1219948,-1,8016
"yes, design appears to be very simple.",1219194,-1,8016
"Yes, the design is quite simple.",1220806,1,8016
"Great use of UML diagrams, flowcharts and mock-ups by the team to clearly explain the flow of their work. It is easy to understand the flow and how the end product will look like.",1219534,-1,8016
They team has done awesome work in representing every detail possible in the flow diagrams. They have created UML diagrams which depicts the flow of the admin and students along with other actors. As mentioned earlier they have also represented the admin flow diagram and instructor flow diagram through the flow chart which makes it very easy for end user to understand the workflow of the requirements in the expertiza system.,1220782,-1,8016
 Yes the visualization is pretty clear and good.,1220441,-1,8016
Proper use of UML to explain the use cases and flow charts to explain the workflow has been done. The plan is complete.,1220406,-1,8016
"Yes, their visualization is good. They are clear and well described the changes.",1220641,-1,8016
"1) In the UML diagram the set of actions that the instructor can perform to add more than one question to nomination and textual type is not added. Also add the actions to modify the display sequence of existing questions. 2) In the instructor flow-chart, the flow for review questionnaire and to modify the display sequence of existing questions is missing.",1220009,1,8016
" The design document includes flow charts, UML diagrams and screenshots which is really impressive as it made the document easier to understand. ",1220561,-1,8016
"The diagrams seems to be good for most of the part. One can understand the project by looking at the diagrams itself. However, in one of the instructor flow diagram, it's given that if the instructor's status is pending the instructor will set the limit to 10. That doesn't make sense. Why would the instructor himself/herself set the limit to 10. Isn't this the responsibility of the system itself to handle this or at the most the admin? Suggestions: Change the 'yes' branch of is pending? to loop 10 times or somehow indicate that pending instructors can add only 10 students to an assignment.",1218920,1,8016
Yes the presence of use case diagrams and flow charts explaining the work flow is good. It would be nice if there were more uml diagrams such as sequence so show various class interactions.  Presence of mockup screens is good. That helps in understanding what is being implemented. It would have been good if the authors put in more details about the validations that that propose in the system ,1219974,1,8016
"Class diagrams are missing. Class diagrams are missing. First flow diagram looks perfect. Second needs some modifications - the instructor login flow should not include a step to set the count limit to 10. This should have been done before only. You should add a step to perform a check to see if the total students count is crossing the allowed limit(10). If yes, then don't add this new student and show some proper error message to the user. If no, then add the student.",1219949,1,8016
"Yes, the uml diagrams sufficiently provide visualization.",1219195,-1,8016
The authors have added UML diagrams as requested in the previous review and it has made a lot of difference. The explanation is much clearer now.,1220807,-1,8016
Test plan outlines the functionalities that the team will test and it seems sufficient to test the changes.,1219535,-1,8016
They team has done tremendous job in following the test driven approach for the project implementation. They have already included the tests they are writing for the functionality implementation. They have covered the exhaustive scenarios  for the project in their test. Their test plan is highly appreciative.,1220783,-1,8016
 The test plan is quite good as it covers all the test cases in the form of 11 test cases which test all the functionalities for the admin and the instructor role. It also considers the negative test cases like throwing an exception when the pending instructor tries to add more then 10 students to his/her course.,1220442,-1,8016
Tests can be made more exhaustive. For now it looks like only the view will be tested but controller should be tested as well.,1220407,1,8016
"Yes, they include the test plan.",1220642,-1,8016
1) The test cases cover all of the functionalities that they are going to implement.,1220010,-1,8016
"Yes, the document includes a test plan. There was no test plan present in the previous version of the design document but the team included the test plan in the second round. The test plan is clear and seems like it would really test the functionalities.",1220562,-1,8016
The test plan has been written in a very good way following the great quality of documentation till the end. It covers all the edge cases and scenarios.,1218782,-1,8016
The test plans are excellent. The best I have seen so far.It has accurately taken all test cases into consideration and described the layout of the final test in the form of a pseudo code. Well Done on the test plan!!,1218921,-1,8016
"Yes, test plans are included",1219489,-1,8016
I would the test section incomplete. The authors have mentioned about 11 test cases thats all. I think that is not at all sufficient. Also missing are unit tests if any and UI tests if any.  I would have liked mention of more test cases both automated as well as UI tests that will ensure basic sanity to the system,1219975,1,8016
"Yes, the test plan looks good. It covers all the functionalities.",1219950,-1,8016
Test plan seems thorough and well thought out.,1219196,-1,8016
The team is following a Test Driven Development approach. They have defined the test cases that need to be tested after the implementation. It seems to completely test the feature.,1220808,-1,8016
"Yes, changes to be made are explained clearly. Document is very clear, includes necessary diagrams, mock-ups and everything possible to make anyone understand what the issues are and what team is planning to do to resolve them. Everything is included in a proper order like for each issue there is a separate flowchart and mock-up. No suggestions required.",1219861,-1,8048
yes the authors have adaquately explained the changes to be made in the system.,1220393,-1,8048
The document is clearly and neatly written. All the necessary sections are present with good explanations.,1220568,-1,8048
Changes are well explained with good visual aids.,1219117,-1,8048
"They have explained every change they want to make to fix the issue. The diagrams, in turn, help a lot to understand the flow of the system.",1219217,-1,8048
Yes the authors have adequately explained all the changes that need to be made. Each issue has a separate list of changes to be made and which files need to be edited.,1220857,-1,8048
The changes are very well documented. For each issue what are the files that needs to be changed is mentioned appropriately. The overall design looks efficient and avoids any duplication. Good Job!,1220127,-1,8048
"Both the problems and proposed changes are clearly detailed. My only suggestion is to put the description of the issue being solved in the same location as the solution to it, otherwise one has to scroll around the page to figure out which problem is being fixed.",1220212,-1,8048
"Yes, they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection. They have not only given proper UML diagrams and the like, but they have also implemented the code and showcased in the ""Test Plan"" and the ""Proposed Design"" section. ",1218942,-1,8048
"In round one, Team has well explained their approach and how are they going to do it. In this round, they have included detailed information and mock UI. It was easy to relate their approach. Their test plan is also thorough. I think the team would definitely be able to incorporate the new changes. Good job guys! ",1219352,-1,8048
The design was well explained in this design doc.,1220498,-1,8048
"Well explanation on problem statement. UML diagrams, flow charts given. Detailed explanation on problem statement. ",1220147,-1,8048
yes!,1220583,-1,8048
"Yes, the document seems to be perfect. It does follow all the appropriate principles and patterns. No suggestions required.",1219862,-1,8048
design is fine. some minor errors like no stop phase.Moreover no design patterns used. Just flowcharts are provided.If some sequence diagram or use case diagrams were provided it would improve the design a lot.,1220394,1,8048
"As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.",1220569,-1,8048
The design is apt following the principles and are self-explanatory,1219218,-1,8048
Yes the design appears to be sound and the flow diagrams illustrate the flow of control very well.,1220858,-1,8048
Yes the design is pretty good. The patterns followed avoids any duplication of code. But I had made a suggestion in Review One to take a look at Project 1843 and it's code. The problem statement is quite similar and the code could be reused. I don't see any mention of it. I hope you do take a look before starting to code as it will avoid any re-work.,1220128,1,8048
All good design principles are being followed where necessary.,1220213,-1,8048
The design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the Logical Flow diagram they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the Proposed Design section so as to elucidate the problem statement.,1218943,-1,8048
The design appears to be neat. ,1219353,-1,8048
The design appears to be sound following the appropriate principles and patterns. ,1220499,-1,8048
"Yes, well designed document. UI mock-ups given. It is structured. ",1220148,-1,8048
sound. so many diagrams.,1220584,-1,8048
"Yes, it is the simplest design and minimal work which is required to resolve the issues. It is very clearly explained. One can clearly understand the problem statement and the proposed solution for the same. The design document is properly structured as well. ",1219863,-1,8048
design is simple and easy to understand.,1220395,-1,8048
"Yes, simple straightforward solutions.",1220570,-1,8048
The diagrams are very basic and covering the entire scope which is a good work by the team,1219219,-1,8048
Yes the design is robust and simple to understand. Each class and view only handles a specific functionality i.e it is modularised.,1220859,-1,8048
Yes the design is straight forward and easy to understand.,1220129,-1,8048
The design appears to be simple given the task at hand.,1220214,-1,8048
"Yes, the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the staggered deadlines assignment section. ",1218944,-1,8048
"Undoubtedly, I like their color coding approach. It's something very simple and apt for the current system.",1219354,-1,8048
The design seems simple and clear. ,1220500,-1,8048
Design is informative. But too detailed. One UML would have been apt.,1220149,1,8048
very clear,1220585,-1,8048
"Yes, the provided diagrams deliver sufficient information about the implementation. Flowcharts and mock UIs screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required changes. No suggestions required.",1219864,-1,8048
The team has discussed their plan using flowcharts. But they have not used any class diagram.,1219827,1,8048
flowcharts are drawn which describe the flow how the system will work after implementation.,1220396,-1,8048
Great use of mock ups. Really appreciate it.,1220571,-1,8048
"Yes, they have added mock UI screenshots which is exactly what they are going to and should do.",1219220,-1,8048
Yes the diagrams clearly illustrate the proposed flow. Different diagrams are provided for different issues. One of the best wikis I have seen,1220860,-1,8048
Very good use of Class and Sequence diagrams to explain the entire design flow. It clearly conveys the thought  process of authors and the overall design.,1220130,-1,8048
Lots of great visualizations are provided that outline a good amount of detail.,1220215,-1,8048
"Yes, the diagrams are clear to show how the system works. But they, are not so lucid so as to show in the diagram how they are going to implement the changes in the system.   ",1218945,1,8048
The team has added their mock UI which shows they have thought about the changes and modification. Mock UIs of the screen shows they are halfway the project. ,1219355,-1,8048
"The class diagram is very useful, and the mock UI with indication on it make it more useful. ",1220501,-1,8048
"Yes, design is informative. Change proposal is detailed. It describes well about how changes are to be implemented.",1220150,-1,8048
The diagram is perfect and clear,1220586,-1,8048
"Yes, design does include a well-described test plan. The provided tests will surely test the functionalities which will be implemenedt. The test plan is represented in a wonderful manner including pre-steps and different testing expectations. Great work. No suggestions are required.",1219865,-1,8048
The design includes test plan.On the testb plan provided it seems like they will test the functionalities. But nothing mentioned on how they will write.,1220397,1,8048
The test plan is comprehensive.,1220572,-1,8048
They have covered all the test plans along with detailed steps.,1219221,-1,8048
"Yes the design includes the test plan. However, the test plan could have been more low level, instead of just writing 'it should' statements.",1220861,1,8048
A through test-plan is described. I do think Test Case-2 could be described more efficiently so that it is clear and easy to understand. Overall looks good.,1220131,1,8048
The test plan is thorough and contains lots of detail that will make it easy to design RSpec tests in the future.,1220216,-1,8048
"The Test Plans are thorough and they gone ahead and shown it in detail by breaking them into steps such as pre-steps, Functional, UI and Performance Testing. This is a very good way to achieve in-depth analysis of the problem and check how effective the solution is.",1218946,-1,8048
"I have to say their test plan includes user interface testing, performance testing, database testing etc. I have to say they have worked really hard for it. I have not yet come across any team who has a test plan like this. ",1219356,-1,8048
An appropriate test plan is included in this design doc. ,1220502,-1,8048
yes the test coverage seems good,1220587,-1,8048
The wiki could have been organized better. It looks a little messy. Not self explanatory. The Use case does not have any actors in it. Suggestion: Code screenshots could have been placed better,1219941,1,8071
1) The authors have explained the functionalities and the changes to be made to the project in depth.,1220042,-1,8071
The authors have made a comprehensive document that clearly outlines the changes that they made. They have included the UML diagram depicting the flow of control. The design section lists the files that were modified and newly created. It also comprises the contents of the summary sheet that gets displayed once an instructor clicks the 360 Assessment icon; LowFI UI and a prototype revealing the relevant fields that are to be displayed in the grade summary.,1220388,-1,8071
The files to be changed have been properly listed. I feel more explanation ought be given as to why these files have been modified and in what way.,1219881,1,8071
The team has mentioned the problem statement and its importance by giving an example of how it saves the time of instructors.,1220097,-1,8071
"The changes are well explained with the help of use case UML diagrams, screen shots of the web pages and prototype of the view. Well done!",1218957,-1,8071
"Yes, the proposed changes and intended output is clearly mentioned in the design document.",1219122,-1,8071
Less explanation on problem statement. Could have elaborated on the problem scenario and why changes needs to be made.,1220122,1,8071
Their task introduction is too short. But the background part explain the changes very well.,1217373,1,8071
The team has done a pretty good job of explaining the changes they are intending to make in great detail. They have added more details from the earlier version.,1220764,-1,8071
"The design looks fine, team has provided the initial test plans. A Lo-fi sketch is available as well. The team could have put git links to the test plan code for better organization.",1219942,-1,8071
1) The design doc is clearly explained. 2) Follows the right design principles.,1220043,-1,8071
The design looks sound and a lot of improvements have been made after the previous round. The design comprises of the list of files modified and created; the fields to be included in the summary sheet and screenshots showing sample prototype of the summary sheet. ,1220389,-1,8071
"Yes, the design seems to incorporate appropriate design patterns. The new view file added is also in accordance with design principles.",1220098,-1,8071
"As mentioned in my previous review, I cannot understand the back-end design handling. Which controller and view files are being modified? or Will new methods or .erb files be added? Any plans to use third-party gems or API's?",1218958,1,8071
The design document is sound and well written.,1219123,-1,8071
"Yes, all required sketches, UML diagrams and views provided. Great work!",1220123,-1,8071
"Very good design, they use LoFi sketch to demonstrate their design. ",1217374,-1,8071
"Yes, the design looks accurate and well thought through. ",1220765,-1,8071
The design is appreciable. There could be some more explanation and implementation details to it.,1219943,1,8071
1) Simple and clear design.  ,1220044,-1,8071
The design is simple and easy to understand because of ample explanation. The authors have also worked on the Activity UML diagram for this round making it easier for the readers to understand. All areas have been covered with respect to presenting the design lucidly.,1220390,-1,8071
The proposed design is easy to understand and explained properly with the help of appropriate screenshots of the view.,1220099,-1,8071
"The authors have explained well on what changes they want to make but it is unclear how it will be implemented. As I had suggested in my previous review, they can mention the expertiza files (controllers, views) involved. ",1218959,1,8071
"Actual project work has not started yet so code modifications have not been mentioned. However, the files to be changed seem appropriate.",1219124,-1,8071
Design is too detailed. I would suggest keeping it short and precise.,1220124,1,8071
Yes.,1217375,-1,8071
"Yes, the design is quite simple and easy to understand. The authors have taken a straightforward approach to implement the feature.",1220766,-1,8071
There is just one flow diagram which does explain the activities to happen. There is no use case diagram with actors and all the uses cases expected. Suggestion: The use case diagram would have given better clarity about the system,1219944,1,8071
UML and class diagram is not possible since the view is the main part. 1) The team explains how the final view should look like in detail.,1220045,-1,8071
"Yes, the document makes extensive use of visual aids- be it activity diagram (UML), screenshots of the views, LowFi UI Sketch of the grade sheet and a prototype of the view showing grade sheet with Expertiza's color scheme and style conventions. All these tools clearly project the changes that are made to the system.",1220391,-1,8071
The team has made a great effort to explain the design through a UML diagram and screenshots of how the feature will work when added to the existing project.,1220100,-1,8071
"The Use case UML diagrams, images of related pages and view's prototype makes it easier to understand the team plans to make required changes to the system.",1218960,-1,8071
Using a Lofi sketch the team clearly shows the intended output.,1219125,-1,8071
"The authors have included flow diagrams, wire frames and even real screen mock-ups. They really help improve clarity.",1220767,-1,8071
The design does include enough test plans. The team has provided the code screenshots for the same. Suggestion: Could have put links to the git code so that the wiki could have been short and precise.,1219945,1,8071
1) The test comprehensively tests the functioning of the system,1220046,-1,8071
The team has completed the implementation and have included the screenshots of the Rspec code that tests the assessment360_controller.rb and specifically the course_student_grade_summary method. They test whether the instance variables provided in the view have been properly instantiated without concerning too much about the values that they hold. They back this up with a link to Ruby's best practice guide for functional tests for controllers. Plus they include feature tests to check whether correct details are displayed. They have also justified the reason for not performing unit tests as they don't alter the model. The highlight of this document is the video links showing the tests performed. Kudos to the team for the effort.,1220392,-1,8071
The test design includes both controller as well as feature tests. The team has also made an effort by putting up video links of the running of tests.,1220101,-1,8071
The authors have explained well on how they intend to test the controllers and features given that the project does not involve any changes to model files. I think  Ruby-On-Rails Guide - Functional Tests for Your Controllers is a good way to go.,1218961,-1,8071
The tests cover all the required functionality. And as it is mentioned controller tests make more sense than unit tests.,1219126,-1,8071
"Yes, tests are explained thoroughly with written code. ",1220126,-1,8071
They have test plan part but not including specific plans.,1217377,1,8071
The authors have proposed an elaborate test plan and it covers the entirety of the functionality they are building.,1220768,-1,8071
Authors have explained well the changes to be made in the system.,1220398,-1,8040
They have mentioned all the changes that have to be made to fix the issues. The screenshots with which changes are to be made in the code explains a lot,1219764,-1,8040
 The authors have described all the proposed changes well. Each issue and with it it's detailed code is given. Well written and solid effort!,1220877,-1,8040
"The wiki documentation is extremely well written with all changes explained clearly and concisely. The good thing about this wiki is that the proposed solution sections is brilliantly explained. The team have clearly mentioned all filenames where they propose to make changes, drawn diagrams to illustrate the flow control, and added snippets of code where necessary. Brilliant",1219901,-1,8040
5 Stars! All but one problem has a snippet with the code fix and a rationale explaining why.,1219021,1,8040
"Yes, the authors have adequately explained what has to be done, the proposed changes,etc.",1220378,-1,8040
"Yes, the authors have clearly explained where and what changes are to be made. They have provided a clear approach for the various fixes in the project.",1220142,-1,8040
Explained in detail which is very good.,1219011,-1,8040
"Yes, the authors have nicely explained the changes to be made. Good work team.",1219834,-1,8040
The authors have highlighted certain parts pf the design where the changes were made. This makes is easier for the reader to understand the changes made. The team has explained the changes made in a clear manner.,1219465,-1,8040
"The project consists of five independent problems the scope of which is well-defined in the design document. The team provides visual diagrams in the solution descriptions which further improve the explanations of changes. The fix for the Issue #1008 - ""Issue related to staggered deadline"" is backed up by a discussion about relevant db tables and corresponding part of code. One minor improvement would be for the authors to highlight the specific parts of code that are going to be changed in the updated block of code. Moreover, the solution to the Issue #1072 - ""Issue related to instructor's assignment participation"" is not specific enough, i.e. it is not clear which structures are going to be affected by the changes. All in all, the document does a great job in explaining what changes are going to be introduced in the system.",1218847,1,8040
flowcharts are simple to understand but no design patterns used.some supporting class diagrams or sequence diagrams would be helpful.,1220399,1,8040
The design and fixes are very well explained with codesnips that include the incorporated adjustments. Nice work.,1218948,-1,8040
Yes the design follow the principle and they have added designs for each issue specifying every detail which is quite a task,1219765,-1,8040
 Yes the design appears to be sound and follows Ruby principles. No code has been repeated and they are using pre written functions in many places instead of just writing the logic again. Good work,1220878,-1,8040
The design/proposed solutions look completely logical and should fix the bugs with no/least redundancy. It also looks like the team has already managed to fix a few bugs as well.  Kudos to them.,1219902,-1,8040
The design appears to be sound: I would make the same choices they did to address the issues.,1219022,-1,8040
"Well, it looks sound to me. It follows the DRY principles as well.",1220379,-1,8040
The design appears to be sound and following appropriate principles. The document is also well described.,1220143,-1,8040
You can add some more explaination of what exactly you'll do in issues like:  Issue #1072 - Issue related to instructor's assignment participation. I felt information is missing here.,1219012,1,8040
All the issues are stated and addressed nicely. The design looks good.,1219835,-1,8040
The design appears to be clear and the team has also implemented functionality to their project. It shows that the team has organized and implemented the design well.,1219466,-1,8040
The team has nailed down which parts of code need to be modified. The changes introduced in the design document are simple and minimal and do not require any extensive discussions about the appropriate principles or patterns.,1218848,-1,8040
design is simple and easy to understand.,1220400,-1,8040
Fixes are simple adjustments to the current code. The last issue requires an addition of a full function but I think that it is appropriate to handle the bug fix as it pulls that responsibility out and keeps things nicely separated and associated for purpose.,1218949,1,8040
The design is very clear and helps in better understanding the flow of the system.,1219766,-1,8040
 Yes the design is simple in nature and easy to understand. This can be attributed to the fact that their issues are quite simple in nature. They could have provided some simple UI mockups of the changes.,1220879,1,8040
The design proposal is coherent and easy to understand. The proposed design and steps for solution are also logical. The team have done a lot of work to think about how to solve the bugs. Good job guys :),1219903,-1,8040
Design appears really simple. Only a couple of added lines here and there.,1219023,-1,8040
The design looks perfect. It is neither overly simple nor it is too complicated.,1220380,-1,8040
The design seems to be as simple as possible. Authors have not unnecessarily complicated the approach but rather have given a simple approach for various fixes.,1220144,-1,8040
"Yes ,it looks simple based on the code snippets they have given and by the diagrams.",1219013,-1,8040
"Yes, the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the review section. ",1219836,-1,8040
"The team has explained the issues and their solutions clearly. The design is simple, hence easy to understand. The proposed solution section is well written where the team has described the changes made in respective files.",1219467,-1,8040
For each problem the authors display relevant chunks of code and discuss which parts need to be changed. Aside from the Issue #1072 all the solutions seem reasonable and simple. One minor suggestion for improvement would be to use the .collect instead of the .each method for computing total_weight in validate_assignment_questionnaires_weights method.,1218849,1,8040
figures are drawn but are not explained in detail.,1220401,1,8040
"As mentioned designs are well depicted and no Mock UI can be found but at this stage, UI is not a priority for the project.",1219767,1,8040
 The visualization provided in the form of flow diagrams in very easy to understand. However ER diagrams of main DB tables could have been provided because it is difficult to understand the data flow and inter relation between tables.,1220880,-1,8040
The diagrams in the wiki clearly describe the flow for proposed changes to the system. We can clearly decipher from the diagrams what the intended functionality is. Good job :),1219904,-1,8040
"No class diagram was needed, and their flow charts and code snippets show the control logic simply.  ",1219024,-1,8040
The team has put UML diagrams for every issue which clearly explains the issue and the workflow.,1220381,-1,8040
The document includes flowcharts which clearly describe the project flow and what needs to be done.,1220145,-1,8040
yes it does.,1219014,-1,8040
"Could have included some screenshots. Otherwise, great work by the team on UML diagrams.",1219837,-1,8040
The team has provided flow charts that explain the working of the system. The team has provided flowcharts for each issue which is commendable.,1219468,-1,8040
The provided diagrams are visualizations of the workflows of different actors in the context of given five issues. They further clarify the changes that are to be made in this project.,1218850,-1,8040
the design includes test plan.Manual testing is emphasized more than automation testing. Moreover how automation testing will be done has not been described.,1220402,1,8040
Detailed test plans are mentioned in the wiki which probably covers all the cases.,1219768,-1,8040
 Yes the design includes a test plan. The tests really test the functionality and also test adverse conditions to see whether error messages are being shown,1220881,-1,8040
"The test plan section defines the steps needed to manually test the functionalities, but I would suggest the team to also include the logic they propose to use in the rspec tests, the objects they would mock etc.",1219905,-1,8040
"Test plan is included, but it makes many references to manual tests. The tests they state could be automated in a straight forward manner.",1219025,-1,8040
The test plan has all the manual testing and automatic testing to be done on each issue.,1220382,-1,8040
The test plan is included in the document.  Both manual and automated testing test plans are given which is appreciable. ,1220146,-1,8040
"Elaborative test plan, which is really good.",1219015,-1,8040
Test plans are present and explained in detail. The tests are really in depth for each issue the team will be fixing.,1219838,-1,8040
"The team has improved their design by adding extra test cases and test procedures which were lacking in the previous submission. The team has provided test cases for each issue, thereby testing every functionality of the project.",1219469,-1,8040
"The test plan is present. It is broken down into separate sections for each of the five issues. Each section is further broken down into a manual and automated testing parts. While the sections for manual testing are comprehensive, the sections for automated tests are too general and do not provide a clear vision for what types of changes are going to be introduced. I would suggest elaborating more on the technical side of the tests, for example specifying which spec files will be modified or whether or not the project will utilize RSpec.",1218851,1,8040
"I can't find any explanation for principles and patterns, maybe the authors should add them to wiki.",1218923,1,8039
The design appears to be sound and seems to follow all the appropriate principles as far as I am concerned. And as mentioned earlier I would again like to point out that the proposed plan section has been handled really well.,1218759,-1,8039
The document is very well structured and is quite easy to follow. They have explained each and everything stepwise.,1219877,-1,8039
It seems the authors didn't have a clear and detailed plan about how to change the current system to meet the requirement. They got the direction to do the project but still lacked details to implement it.,1219363,1,8039
"Yes, the design seems appropriate and suitable for the case. Maybe the author could specify the patterns they use in the document.",1218724,-1,8039
"Yes, simple straightforward solutions.",1220680,-1,8039
the design is simple,1220104,-1,8039
The design is both simple and clear. It should be better to add another step for the comparison of the instructor review and the student review. Both as a final examination and a testing.,1220174,-1,8039
"Yes the design is as simple as possible. However they have only described the proposed design. They could have provided simple mock ups or samples,",1220801,1,8039
"The approach is clear, but is not clear as to what changes will be needed in the system.",1220510,1,8039
"Yes, pretty simple. Great job!",1218924,-1,8039
"The design appears to be simple to the best of my knowledge. Not a lot of files needed to be changed, signifying that they are just targeting specific files in order to make minimum number of changes possible not making it too complex.",1218760,-1,8039
"The document is well explained. Thus, it reduces complexity and makes itself appear quite easy for the user to understand. However, more diagrams and flowcharts would have helped even more.",1219878,1,8039
"The design is as simple as possible, and described in a straightforward manner.",1220266,-1,8039
"Actually,, the design seems not simple. Due to the ambiguous of the design, I cannot tell clearly what the four links are used to do in the first step, but it seems too many links will be used and some strange conditions need to be checked before instructors can perform a review. In addition, it seems not all the instructors can do the reviews, so there may be some errors? Description for step 2 is also complex and seems include a lot of jobs need to do.",1219364,1,8039
The design seems simple and feasible.,1218725,-1,8039
The documentation done by the team is very detailed and explains the problem statement very clearly. They have described the functionality change in bullet points which makes it very easy to understand the sub parts required to achieve the main functionality in simple terms. ,1220882,-1,8104
"It seems to me that the implementation of the project has not started yet. Hence, the exact place in the Expertiza code where they plan to make changes is missing. This should be added in my opinion. Additionally, they have explained very well as to what changes need to be done and how they will be done. So, good job there.",1219400,1,8104
"Yes, the changes to be made are nicely explain. The diagrams and screenshots are in place. Suggestion: There was more scope to the test plans",1219951,1,8104
No. Not clear,1219606,1,8104
Yes the author has made a great attempt to explain the changes by trying to explain the changes required with the help of the application flow diagram and the use case diagram and how the changes were implemented by giving screenshots of the changes.,1220518,-1,8104
The wiki page is very explanatory and the authors have explained the issue and fix very well,1219789,-1,8104
Yes the required changes for the reviews is explained clearly. The design for each required change is also explained in depth now.,1220408,-1,8104
The authors have clearly mentioned the changes to be made using Problem Statement and Use Case Diagram.,1220072,-1,8104
"Yes, they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection. They have not only given proper UML diagrams and the like, but they have also implemented the code and showcased in the ""Implementation"" section. ",1218852,-1,8104
The authors haven;t given the files to be modified or the changes they are going to do to the system.,1219896,1,8104
The design doc explains the project in detail. I would suggest that the description could be modified by removing redundancy to make the doc more succinct. Also what MVC files are being touched could have been mentioned.,1219177,1,8104
The team explained everything required and not leave anything behind. ,1220528,-1,8104
"The team has very well explained the changes they are making in the project to achieve the functionality. However, they have not included any design explanation explicitly. They have not described the approach they have come with. It might be helpful if they could add the design approach as well in the wiki link so that its easier to understand the code changes by having a glance at the design pattern.",1220883,1,8104
The design seems to be following the appropriate principles and uses the appropriate guidelines. They usecase diagram mentions each actor and the role associated.,1219401,-1,8104
"The design does appear to be sound. The team has put most of the use cases, actors and explained them well. The screenshots of the UI are also present. Suggestion: Could have explained the implementation a bit more in bullet points.",1219952,1,8104
Yes,1219607,-1,8104
Yes the design is very simple and explains the changes required in a very clear manner,1220519,-1,8104
The flow and UML diagrams are well designed and explain a lot about the system flow. addition of detailed use case helps support the diagram,1219790,-1,8104
"The overall design looks good. The score calculation formula still looks a bit weird. Using the current formula, it is possible to have a higher  composite score than each of the individual scores , which should not be the case. ",1220409,1,8104
There is no mention for the design strategy or design pattern to be used in the implementation.,1220073,1,8104
"The design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the use case diagram in which the users are student and instructor and the data base is where the actions are stored in the database and the retrieved from the same for the case of reviews information.  Also, they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the Application Flow section so as to elucidate the problem statement.",1218853,-1,8104
I like the part where the peer review has been given more weightage in comparison to self review in the composite score.,1219897,-1,8104
Yes the team seem to have a clear idea as to what must be done and how the result must look. It would be helpful if the team gave some insights as to how the composite score formula was decided as this is the heart of the project.,1219178,1,8104
The design appears to followed appropriate principles and patterns. ,1220529,-1,8104
"As stated above, the team has not explained any design pattern they are following. However they have mentioned all the code changes they are making for this functionality implementation. The code snippets they have included is very useful to understand the exact code changes they are making and the files which are getting impacted. This would help the future developers to understand the  code in a simple manner.",1220884,1,8104
"The design looks good. But from the implementation details given and the amount of use cases listed, I feel there could be some more implementation details that are left out.",1219953,1,8104
Complex design,1219608,1,8104
es the design is very simple and explains the changes required in a very clear manner,1220520,-1,8104
The design is simple and very much in depth. and follows the principle,1219791,-1,8104
Yes the design is simple and easy to understand for others too. The explanation along with diagrams provides enough information to understand the use-case.,1220410,-1,8104
"Yes, the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the review section. ",1218854,-1,8104
"Yes, the design looks simple , no complications and the screenshots are really helpful.",1219179,-1,8104
The design is as simple as possible. ,1220530,-1,8104
Basic UML used,1219609,-1,8104
yes the application flow diagram tells of how the functionality will be accessed both by user and student and the use case diagram explains the interaction of the instructor and the students for the particular functionalities ,1220521,-1,8104
Some UI screenshots are added along with design diagrams which describe the system. The UI or mock UI helps in better understanding,1219792,-1,8104
The explanation and the diagrams don't match exactly. The explanation says user should be able to see composite and peer review scores only after he completes his own review. That is not captured in the flow diagram. Else it is self explanatory,1220411,1,8104
The UML diagrams are detailed and explained well. Suggestion: The application flow could be explained in points so that the reviewer has a clearer view of what is the sequence of events occurring.,1219954,1,8104
"The visualizations seem to be complete. The team has included an application flow diagram, a use case diagram and also a screenshot of how the actual result should look. So, in my opinion, good job done!",1219403,-1,8104
The team has done tremendous job in adding visualization aids. They have added application flow diagrams for every actor along with the UML diagram of the student and instructor. They have also included screenshots to explain the code functionality implementation of enabling self reviews and score pages. This makes the document descriptive and very easy to read and understand.  ,1220885,-1,8104
The chart and diagrams are well done and help explain how the code will work.,1219345,-1,8104
The use case diagram and application flow diagram very well explains the changes made to the system.,1220075,-1,8104
"Yes, the diagrams are clear to show how the system works. But they, are not so lucid so as to show in the diagram how they are going to implement the changes in the system. ",1218855,1,8104
Yes the visuals provided with this doc are clear and just by that a lot can be understood.,1219180,-1,8104
The team has an outline of the test plan and the test scenarios which they are planning to take care of. It would be suggested that the team takes care of all the exhaustive scenarios which are related to the functionality. They could also add the step wise description of the scenarios they have mentioned or the test cases they are planning to implement. Test driven approach makes sure our code is exhaustive of all scenarios.,1220886,1,8104
The test plan can be more elaborate and complete. This will help as part of the behaviour driven design process and also help you test whether every change made works correctly.,1219404,1,8104
The design has been listed with a few test plans. I feel that there could be more tests included. Suggestion: Test plans need to be explained more and could provide the code if TDD approach is used.,1219955,1,8104
No tests,1219610,1,8104
Yes the test plan is included but the test plan appears to be very shallow as it gives the which functionalities must be test but doesn't mentions it inform of test like what should be the actions taken when a certain condition arises it can be more clearly stated by mentioning the test cases in form of context and it statements,1220522,1,8104
The test plan added is just a basic case and as the changes are just some calculations to be made test plan is not much of a requirement for the project.,1219793,-1,8104
Test plan is very shallow. Only the headings are mentioned. A proper description of what is the test for and what to expect from each test will be helpful in understanding.,1220412,1,8104
There is no proper test plan. The authors have just mentioned the required tests that needs to be done. No proper explanation has been given about how these tests will be implemented.,1220076,1,8104
"No, not really, the design is does not implement the test plan but rather goes on to show how the pre existing Expertiza algorithm works. So it would help if they showed the same. ",1218856,1,8104
The current tests written are good but it would be good if the team had pointed out the corner cases as wel such as - what happens if the deadline for self-review is exceeded? Does that mean the peer-review scores cannot be seen? Or is a default score of 0 is set?,1219181,1,8104
A test plan is included in this design doc. ,1220532,-1,8104
Necessary visual inputs are present to aid explanation.,1220681,-1,8039
"Yes, appropriate visual cue is present in the form of screen shots",1220105,-1,8039
"The diagram only stated the current scenario.. There's no final picture, no UML diagram. The figure didn't clearly describe the changes to be made to the system. It should be better if there's a UML diagram from the user practice side, a diagram for the design plan, and also another figure for the final picture: how dows it look like when the plan is implemented.",1220175,1,8039
"No, the proposed UI changes are only mentioned and the diagrams in the wiki are of the current system. Use draw.io for mockups and drawings.",1220802,1,8039
Team has used screenshots to show the current scenario but any flowcharts/UML to describe how they are solving the problem is missing. Adding these will make the document easier for anyone not familiar the project understand it better,1220511,1,8039
Excellent use of visualizations!,1219335,-1,8039
There have been some screenshots however I feel like some more details and diagram could have been added in this section.,1218761,1,8039
No diagrams present,1219498,-1,8039
There are no UML diagrams. I would suggest them to include a test case diagram that can improve understandability.,1219879,1,8039
"There are visual aids included with the design, depicting the current state of the system as well as proposed icons to institute the design changes.",1220267,-1,8039
The design lacks diagrams to state what the changes they will do and how it will be like after change. It is difficult to image how the system will be like after change and what will be changed.,1219365,1,8039
The authors provide some screenshots which make their project more clear. It would be better if they provide more diagrams to explain their solutions.,1218726,1,8039
"I see test cases properly defined, but the test plan is missing.",1220682,1,8039
Yes the test plan is included.I think the tests will cover all scenarios,1220106,-1,8039
"There is a test plan, the tests are deep and detailed. However, the current test plan is not enough to test the functionalities. They are just unit tests. It should be added with a tests that directed tests whether the instructor can do the same kind of review as the students, from the user 's perspective (for example, log in, do the review, etc)",1220176,1,8039
The testing appears to be pretty rigorous. They have taken into account cases when TA/instructor's scores should be excluded. The test cases could have been better described.,1220803,-1,8039
Team has done a good job in identifying the cases that needs to be tested. It will be an improvement if they can add details on how they plan to test each controller/view separately.,1220512,-1,8039
"Yes, there is a detailed test plan for this project. Not only basic features testing but also other more testing.",1218926,-1,8039
The test plan looks really thorough covering all the possible scenarios. I am personally happy with the given test-plan.,1218762,-1,8039
They have discussed clearly what functionalities they are going to test to make the project more efficient. I think they have made a quite descent research in the testing aspect of the project.,1219880,-1,8039
The design includes the test plan.,1220268,-1,8039
"The test plan is shallow. It only state what features the team will test but how the features will be test, what and how many cases will be included are not clear. The team should expand the plan for each features they aim to test, including specific steps and different cases.",1219366,1,8039
"Yes, the test plan looks good. The author lists all the cases they need to test.",1218727,-1,8039
"They have a paragraph saying what they are going to do, but it could be broken up into parts with images for better understanding",1218891,-1,8045
They have one scenario. maybe a few more could help better test their work,1218895,-1,8045
"Yes, the proposed solutions part clearly stated that they will go through each review to compare the new review score, etc, and then they will store the review URL. However, the solution is not concrete enough and is a little bit hard to follow. It should be great if there's more details in stating about how to loop through each reviews.  ",1220157,-1,8045
"The design is sound because it follows the problem statement and the instructions. I doubt if it follows the DRY principle while looping through each review, because that might be already done in the Expertiza. In terms of patterns, I think here it needs to use the factory pattern, altough it's not stated in the design.",1220158,1,8045
No changes has been done,1219284,-1,8026
"The design is simple, although it could be better if it has more concrete examples.",1220159,1,8045
"There are a lot of diagrams, but the application flow and the UML Diagram doesn't look very clear. We can hardly see the words in the UML Diagram. Also, the diagrams seem to not fit each other. How does the application diagram and the Uml diagram connect to each other? There's no clear instructions. Also, I don't think a screen shot of code in the design doc is a good idea. I think it could be better if the changes expected to be made can be described in a more abstract fashion. ",1220160,1,8045
" The authors have done good job explaining the changes to be made to the system, and even explaining why other, more obvious options, are not chosen. It still sounds like a complicated change to make to the system.",1219112,1,8026
"There's a testing plan. Although the testing plan seems to cover the fuctionalities, it is not clearly stated. The tester should log in as what role? how to select a teams assignment and review it? How to log out and check the instructor's email? which instructor email should the tester check? These questions should have been answered in the test plan.",1220161,1,8045
"Yes, they explained a lot for the changes. Great job!",1219576,-1,8026
"The team has mentioned properly what changes they are doing and how they will be doing them. In the first submission they had suggested the possible approaches. Now, they are having a concrete way they are implementing these changes.",1219556,-1,8026
"Yes, and at times, much more than necessary! ",1219732,-1,8026
Yes. The authors have made changes to the design document and are more specific about how exactly they plan to implement the new functionality.,1220503,-1,8026
"The design document contains all the necessary sections but fails to provide adequate explanation of the changes to be made. The authors have done a good job at explaining the current scenario, also identified the code where the changes are to be made. They have identified the need of a new function and its purpose, but fail to provide a design of the intended changes, i.e. new functions or modifications in the functions, any need to use different variables etc. The authors have not added any changes relevant to the previous suggestions.",1219621,1,8045
"As they have provided a very high-level idea of their proposed solution, there is no pseudocode or any class diagram which helps explain the design adequately. You can improvise the design by including flow of the methods, to highlight how and where will your new method come into picture. However, looking at the intended modifications, it seems that the changes follow DRY principles, and changes are not unnecessary. There is also no need of using any design patterns as per the required changes.",1219622,1,8045
The team added more information from the last time which aided in a better explanation of the problem. Good job team,1220339,-1,8026
1) The authors have adequately explained the changes to be made to the design document.,1220047,-1,8026
"The design does appear to be simple, as they have not planned to modify any of the existing methods. Their new method will interact with Response, AssignmentQuestionnaire model, and then link the assignment to the review in the email. However, they have not mentioned if they have planned any data structure/variable to store the assignment link and pass it on to the method where email notification will be sent. But, i suppose that storing it in a variable will suffice. ",1219623,1,8045
"The visualization aids used currently are application flow diagram, and use cases. They are useful to understand the scenario of the problem statement. However, a sequence or a communication diagram will really be beneficial to understand how the method interfaces with the other  methods. This will help identify if the new method impacts other functionalities and will portray the proposed solution efficiently.",1219624,1,8045
"The explanations are more than sufficient. Not only have the authors explained the changes to the system, but also explained the reasoning for considering those changes. I like the way that they also explained the other different ways they could've integrated the GitHub metrics but avoided those methods with sufficient reasoning for the same.The team has also given an explanation of their database design modifications would be like which is good.",1218733,-1,8026
"I think that there is a huge scope for test plan improvisation. The current test plan is just a step-by-step procedure to test if the reviewer receives a mail fir conflicting reviews. The test plan should also include test cases to test whether the link is present in the email notification. Also, is the link correct and navigable? The test plan should also cover the pits where the functionality may fail, so as to ensure smooth functioning of the system.",1219625,1,8045
"Yes , excellent work done by the team. The design document adequately explains what is the problem that they are trying to solve, what is the proposed solution and how the solution would look like.  There are enough details to in the document to understand what is being done and what changes are proposed. The document also has enough illustrations on what is the current situation. ",1220001,-1,8026
The authors adequately explained the changes they plan to make.,1219699,-1,8026
The team has provided a code snippet which includes solution to their problem statement. They have described the code and their proposed changes,1219470,-1,8045
"By looking at the flow-charts and UML diagrams submitted by the team, their solution appears to be sound.",1219471,-1,8045
The team has provided diagrams that make it easier for the reader to understand the workflow of the system and the changes that they have proposed to implement the solution.,1219472,-1,8045
"As mentioned, the team has provided UML diagrams stating the two actors in their system- Student, Instructor and their interaction with the email module and database.",1219473,-1,8045
Not enough explanation,1219289,1,8045
The design seems to be sound. They have a sample design where they are explaining the tables and how they plan to work with them as well. The examples provided help understand how the data will be stored.,1219557,-1,8026
Yes,1219733,-1,8026
Yes. The team intends to use grade_controller to show github metric which would be a good place to implement this functionality. The idea to involve instructors because of a 60 requests/hour limit may complicate the project. Another idea would be to update metrics with a round robin scheduling of GET requests. ,1220504,1,8026
Design is okay,1219290,-1,8045
Yes,1219285,-1,8026
Very basic design,1219291,-1,8045
No visualization,1219292,-1,8045
"Yes, they included some design principles, which is good. Maybe the authors could add some design patterns into wiki.",1219577,1,8026
No test plan,1219293,-1,8045
 The design appears to be sound. They have weighed their options and are using an official gem to interact with the github api.,1219113,-1,8026
I don't see any issue in the design document. They have followed a good design principle.,1220340,-1,8026
1) The authors have mentioned several approaches in which these functionalities could be implemented. 2) Their chosen approach is follows MVC architecture and DRY principles.,1220048,-1,8026
"The design appears to be sound for most part of it. The linking between the different sections seems appropriate. The only issue I have is with the mock-up in the Design Details -> Second Change mock-up number 2. I think that the bar chart is being displayed for each and every day. I feel that is not only highly unnecessary but also would be very overwhelming for the instructor to process all this information because:-i) It is common knowledge that many students do not begin projects until a few days/weeks would have passed since the assignment is posted. So that would leave the initial few days of the bar chart empty with nothing valuable to show.ii) The duration of each project varies from project to project. Assignment 2 had a duration of about 20 -30 days. This would mean that there would be about 20 bar charts for each day which would be quite difficult for the TA/instructor to process for just one team let alone for so many other teams they need to evaluate. Suggestions: Instead of providing bar chart for each day aggregate it to a bar chart for each week or one in 5 days. And then maybe towards the deadline or like a week before the deadline you could switch to 1 barchart per day. OR Provide an option to switch between the scaling of time periods like a week, 5 days, 1 day etc.",1218734,1,8026
"Yes, the github api integration looks good. the only part missing was perhaps they could have documented the rest calls that they are going to make in the document as well. Usage of existing gems is good and eases lot of implementation pains  ",1220002,1,8026
 The design sound very reasonable.  ,1219700,-1,8026
"The design is concise and clear. They have added reference images of how the system would look after their changes, which properly shows the expected implementation results.",1219558,-1,8026
Yes. It is thoroughly investigated.,1219734,-1,8026
The idea to involve instructors because of a 60 requests/hour limit may complicate the project. Another idea would be to update metrics with a round robin scheduling of GET requests. ,1220505,1,8026
Yes,1219286,-1,8026
"Their design is much simple and clear, also easy to understand.",1219578,-1,8026
"Yeah, I believe it is as simple as possible while choosing the best path for the expertiza project to grow, but it still sounds like a very ambitious project for 1 group to complete.",1219114,1,8026
"With proper documentation, the problem is explained nicely and understanding of the complex problem is made easier.",1220341,-1,8026
1) Have clearly mentioned when will GitHub Api be hit to retrive the data and which gem will be used.,1220049,-1,8026
The design appears to be fairly simple. I think however there will be difficulty in implementing the GitHub metrics for latest data vs data before the submission deadlines.,1218735,1,8026
"Yes, the authors are using already existing gems for the implementation. I would have liked to see a section on caching if any.  Rest the solution proposed looks simple and straightforward and looks that it will easily integrate into the current system  ",1220003,1,8026
 Their design is simple and clear.  ,1219701,-1,8026
The use case diagram properly shows how the addition of this feature will help for the instructor role.,1219559,-1,8026
The visualizations used by the team are comprehensive and well made.,1220506,-1,8026
Good design,1219287,-1,8026
"excellent use of screenshots, made things very clear for me.",1219322,-1,8026
"Yes, they use a lot of diagrams to show use case.",1219579,-1,8026
 The photos included are superb at showing the expected View.  They can have more 1 or 2 more stars if most of the Expteriza work for the github metrics was already completed when they made these screen shots. Do you think it is feasible to expect that you can start a software project before getting a green light on the project in order to include high quality pictures of your proposed View in action?,1219115,1,8026
Use case diagram is present but it would have been nice to see a sequence diagram to understand the flow. ,1220342,-1,8026
Explains the different approaches with the help of use case diagram.,1220050,-1,8026
"The use case diagram appears to be slightly incorrect. The symbol for an should be a stick figure not a rectangle. But that is a minor error. Also, the Use Case Diagram Details mention student as an actor but the diagram shows no instance of student as an actor. I think the Student as an actor shouldn't be included because in the current use case only the instructor is the primary actor and the assignment should have been submitted by the time the instructor views the scores, thus, requiring no involvement from the students at that point in time.Mention of Primary sequence in the Use Case Diagram Details seems highly unnecessary and potentially unrelated.",1218736,1,8026
There are enough aids such as uml diagrams and screen shots. The authors explicitly mention that there are no db changes so no need of an er diagram. Although I would have liked some class level details to be mentioned in the document that would help to dig more about the design changes,1220004,1,8026
 They not only use use case diagram but also mock-up screenshot to help the reader understand their design.  ,1219702,-1,8026
The test plan does include a high level of testing scenarios the team plans to cover. I would suggest the team should add BDD tests so they can test the same after the development phase is over.,1219560,1,8026
"The test plan seems adequate at this stage, edge cases may need to be considered at a later stage.",1220507,-1,8026
No,1219288,-1,8026
Not well structured and less content,1219500,1,8045
few more test cases can be added,1219323,1,8026
"The authors have explained well what changes they wish to make and how they plan to implement those changes. I would suggest them to add more details like, ""where do they store the list of responses more than the notification threshold"". Overall good job.",1219871,-1,8045
"Yes, it includes the test plan with a great detail.",1219580,-1,8026
"Design does seem to be sound, but complex. As mentioned in the earlier review, I am unsure if looping over each review is the correct thing to do or not. Maybe the team discussed this with the mentor and decided against it as no new information has been added in the document. If so, I would only suggest the team to include the complexity of the design in the document.",1219872,1,8045
 The test plan seems adequate enough to show that they understand what to test.,1219116,-1,8026
Few test plan is written. The team can add more test plan.,1220343,1,8026
Good test plan. Should include more test cases that check the functionality of GitHub integration. eg: If number of lines of code committed by a student is correctly computed.,1220051,1,8026
"Yes, the design is as simple as it can get. Understanding the principle is not hard. But making it simple should also not make it costly. Good work to the team if the instructors were looking for something this simple :)",1219873,-1,8045
The design includes a test plan. However the test plan has nothing related to tests or which test cases are going to be considered. It just explains the flow of how an instructor would reach the GitHub metrics data page.The team should at least mention which files are the test cases going to be written on and what functionalities are they going to test.,1218737,1,8026
"The UML diagrams given in the document list the process flow for testing/understanding the changes which will be made in the document. But, unfortunately, no diagram exists which describe the changes to be made.   I would suggest the team to add diagrams for the pseudo-code they may have written.",1219874,-1,8045
"The test plan section unfortunately lists no concrete test that the team would write. Checking the functionality manually, and writing rspec tests for the code written are extremely different, and I would suggest the team to have a dedicated test plan section, mentioning the controller/model they wish to test, the objects they would need to mock etc.",1219875,1,8045
"The test section looks inadequate as of now, only two test scenarios are mentioned and no details on automation or UI.  More so no mention of tests in the document.",1220005,1,8026
 Test plans for both of their subtasks were present.  ,1219703,-1,8026
A format of the proposed email to be sent would be helpful,1219311,-1,8045
some additional tests can be added,1219315,-1,8045
"Yes, the problem statement and the proposed changes have been clearly explained.",1220274,-1,8045
"The design and application flow appear to be as simple as possible, as well as the proposed code changes snippet provided.",1220276,-1,8045
"There are UML and application flow diagrams included with the design document, which serve to make the proposed design changes much clearer.",1220277,-1,8045
Test plan is as simple as required for the problem statement in question.,1220278,-1,8045
"Yes, they include this part in the Proposed Solutions field. It would be better if they use visualization to let the readers better understand the flow.",1220217,-1,8045
"The design seems workable. Maybe they can come up a more sound design. For example, they can try many ways to define the notification limit.",1220218,-1,8045
The design is simple and really better than before.,1220219,-1,8045
"They used the UML diagrams, it really help me a lot when reading the wiki page. Maybe they can also make diagrams about the changes they are going to make.",1220220,1,8045
They did include a test plan. It would be better if they also test the instructor side.,1220221,1,8045
"After the first review, the design has improved significantly. The proposed design clearly defines the changes being made by the team.",1220814,-1,8045
There has been a significant improvement in the level of details provided. The author can further improve the document by providing the details of the design pattern to be used.,1220815,-1,8045
The design seems to be pretty straightforward.,1220816,-1,8045
The author uses the UML diagram to properly describe the system. ,1220817,-1,8045
The document does contain a test plan which can definitely be extended to incorporate certain negative test cases.,1220818,-1,8045
The design has improved and updates has been done and it is easy to comprehend the changes to be made to the system.,1220344,-1,8045
The design seems simple.,1220346,-1,8045
Proper diagrams are used by the team. ,1220347,-1,8045
Design doc includes the test plan but more detail on negative test cases would have been better.,1220348,-1,8045
"No, their didn't include enough text explanation.",1220668,1,8045
"Yes, but they didnt show their principles and pattern very well.",1220669,1,8045
"Yes, it simple but some parts are not easy to understand.",1220670,1,8045
"Yes, the use of visualization is great.",1220671,-1,8045
"Yes, the doc contains test plan, but they are not specific.",1220672,1,8045
I know exactly what this team is doing.,1219586,-1,8045
It seems as though this team's approach was well designed.,1219587,-1,8045
"The way the team plans to loop through each review to calculate a review score seems slightly more complex than necessary, but I agree with them taking this apporach as it will allow them to break down the reason why the scores are different.",1219588,-1,8045
The test plan seems overly simplistic. It only tests whether the team's changes work in the most drastic scenario possible. It seems like they should have more boundary value tests and more test cases to account for their new method of looping through the reviews to compare new reviews with previous ones.,1219590,1,8045
"Team has added most of the missing screenshots. There will be no design patterns involved in bootstrap so i'd say the document is now complete. Only thing i would suggest is, since bacui may not have a wiki, this document can be moved to a wiki page of github repository. ",1220413,1,8078
They have a lot of mockups showing what they plan to do ,1218876,-1,8078
"The team have taken time to explain each functionality properly in the second round. They list all the changes that they wish to make in the views. However, I would suggest the team to also mark out (circle out) the area they wish to change in the screenshot of the view.",1219926,1,8078
"Yes, they include a problem statement in this page. The statement is clear and easy to understand.",1219684,-1,8078
The team has well explained the changes to be made to the system.,1220648,-1,8078
"Yes, the authors have explained the changes to be made clearly along with diagrams",1219127,-1,8078
All the changes made to the system have been supplemented with explanations and mock-ups.,1218912,-1,8078
"Explanations are okay , there needs to be more detail on what is being done and how the final outlook view would be. As of now not much details have been put in the document. A before and after view would have adequately shown the impact the this work will make. ",1220202,-1,8078
"  Yes, there is few basic details mentioned in the document, but not adequate changes are explained. It's far better work than last round, yet the team has to give a better overview on Bacui and elaborate the problem statement. ",1218977,-1,8078
"For the ""manage participant"" part, the authors didn't explain how will they solve the issue that the ""add student"" button cannot work correctly after a user add a course. The document included other changes need to be made, but the explantation was not clear enough. The design used a lot of components in Bootstrap, but the authors didn't give any explantations to these components they would use and didn't give any diagrams to show what the changes will be like.",1219137,1,8078
The authors only explain what needs to be changed but no specific steps. If would be better if they can provide more details about how will they implement the functions they mention in the document.,1218743,1,8078
The team has updated their design document to include all the changes they are planning to make. This is a good improvement from the earlier version.,1220754,-1,8078
Design is good,1220414,-1,8078
The design is reasonable and workable.,1219685,-1,8078
"Since its UI based project, their design is pretty intuitive and simple.",1220649,-1,8078
"Although what changes are to be made is explained, how they are going to be made isn't explained. However, there is no Ruby code involved just CSS styling so applying appropriate principles and patterns does not really apply in this case.   ",1219128,1,8078
There is no scope of using any design patterns or principles since this is a UI-based project and there is no scope for the application of design principles.,1218913,-1,8078
Yes the document mainly talks about small changes at different places in the application that are being done. I think more implementation details with ample justification are missing. if the team is using certain apis why are they using should have been mentioned.  ,1220203,1,8078
"There is no design provided in the document, as its mainly UI changes. Yet, the team should have dived in detail about their choices to achieve a particular look and feel needed. The document seems to be over-simplification of the implementation and can be improved further.  ",1218978,-1,8078
The design is not clear enough. More details are needed.,1218744,1,8078
The changes are to be made in the UI and the team is planning to use appropriate design elements.,1220755,-1,8078
team plans to use all of the bootstrap functions and ,1220415,-1,8078
"The design changes appear simple and clear. Only suggestion to the team would be to explain the design choices a little more. As mentioned above, give an example of how, where to use Bootstrap and Jumbotron.",1219928,1,8078
"Yes, their design seems simple ",1220650,0,8078
"Yes, the design doc is simple and well explained",1219129,-1,8078
"Yes, the design appears to be as simple as possible. There are a limited number of Bootstrap components being used the complexity of the project is limited and the end result appears to be as simple as possible. ",1218914,-1,8078
Yes this looks simple with several point fixes required to be done. The authors also talk about using bootstrap 4 which is good. I would have liked if they could quickly put up certain mock screens using the bootstrap.  ,1220204,-1,8078
"Its an UI intensive project, so no specific design approaches are applicable. But the team should have put it more details into the document to elaborate the changes and they choice of tools under the bootstrap framework. Like a pill or navtab or navbar is going to be used to achieve a particular look, and if one of them, why the choice. Such details on decisions should be included in the design document.",1218979,1,8078
The authors didn't provide enough information about the components they will use and how they will use. It is difficult to evaluate the complexity of the deign without these information.,1219139,1,8078
The tasks they need to do seems simple but more design details are needed.,1218745,-1,8078
"Yes, the design is very simple.",1220756,-1,8078
Team has done their best in visualizing whatever design they had.,1220416,-1,8078
"The diagrams added clearly explain which views need to be modified, but if the team could just mark the point where changes are to be made in the screenshot, it would be the icing on the cake. Still good work :)",1219929,-1,8078
They gave all the UI interfaces they are going to make. It's suggested that they can include the origin page and the changed page which the reader can compare with.,1219687,-1,8078
They have included mock UI screens which make their proposed changes quite clear. ,1220651,-1,8078
Class diagrams/UML diagrams do not apply here. But explanation with snapshots is provided.,1219130,-1,8078
Not necessary since it's a UI based project.,1218915,-1,8078
"No, i feel that that adequate visual aids and diagrams are missing in the document. only a few screens to show. It would have been better if the authors could have put before and after details on what is being done. uml diagrams to show the flow and then justify the changes that they are trying to make  ",1220205,-1,8078
"The team has provided current system UI, but no expectations on the UI for this project. For an UI intensive project, I believe its essential to have at least a minimal wireframe that serves as the base for good design document so every stake-holder can be on the same page with regard to expectations.",1218980,1,8078
"The authors only provided diagrams to state what the UI likes now but not provide any diagrams to explain how the system will be like after changes. Especially, they didn't explain the components they will use, it is more difficult for me to understand what kind of results they intended to get after changes.",1219140,1,8078
"The authors provide some screenshot of the pages they need to change. It would be better if they provide more diagrams to explain their design, for example, a UML diagram about the relationship of all the class they need to change.",1218746,1,8078
Make sure to test each interactions properly after the design is complete.,1220417,-1,8078
no test plan section at all,1218880,-1,8078
I meant to leave this blank. Kindly ignore the rating for this question as this project does not require any tests. All the changes made are CSS related.,1219930,1,8078
"Since it's Ui project, they says they will test all the pages changed.",1219688,-1,8078
"Since this is a UI based project, they don't need any functionality testing. the team is planning to do manual testing which is all they need to for this project.",1220652,-1,8078
"No, UI tests can be added here, but the team has not considered them.",1219131,-1,8078
No tests needed.,1218916,-1,8078
"The authors have just mentioned that they are going to do some testing since it is mostly ui based. I would have liked if they could at least give details of steps in each test scenario that could be performed to execute the case, even that is missing. This section is incomplete and would have liked if the authors could put in more effort and details on how to do this",1220206,1,8078
No test plan,1218981,-1,8078
"There are no tests included in the document, but there is an issue need to be fixed, which needs test plan to make sure it can work correctly. Also, the UI need to test to guarantee the intended results.",1219141,-1,8078
There is no test plan.,1218747,-1,8078
"Yes, the authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system. Document is simple, succinct and easy to understand. Great use of flow charts, uml diagrams and mockups to visually represent the information is done. ",1219531,-1,8076
"The document provided by the team is very detailed and includes all the requirements which are suggested by the Change Request. However, the team may change tone of the document as it is instructive  right now which seems like the change request description itself. The team might also add a wiki link for this document so that it could be included in the expertiza links of existing and ongoing changes and would be more reachable to a wider audience.",1220779,1,8076
 Yes the author has provided a sufficient explanation of what changes needs to be done to the system by giving flow diagrams and screenshots about what changes they are going to incorporate in their system,1220438,-1,8076
Team has added all the diagrams and screenshots. The document is well explained and looks complete.,1220403,-1,8076
"Yes, their explanations are adequately explained the changes.",1220638,-1,8076
1) The authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system. 2) They also have given the files to be modified/added for each change.  ,1220006,-1,8076
Authors have clearly explained all the changes to be made and where to make them. The design document is quite clear and easy to understand.,1220558,-1,8076
I think that the authors have done a really good job of explaining and covering all the changes to be made. Overall this is the best document i have seen so far.,1218778,-1,8076
The authors have explained all the changes to be made very clearly and concisely. Each change is supplemented with sufficient diagrams and mock-ups so as to make the final task of visualization easier.,1218917,-1,8076
The document seems complete,1219485,-1,8076
Yes the authors have tried to explain what changes are required and what they plan to do however I feel that exact changes that they might be doing are missing. They could have listed most files that will need modification and if necessary new files that will be changed,1219971,1,8076
"Yes, one of the best design docs of project 4!",1219946,-1,8076
"The document was very well written previously too, and they have improved it with diagrams and test. Nice work.",1219192,-1,8076
The authors have considerably improved on the document. UML diagrams as requested have been added.,1220804,-1,8076
"Yes, the design follows appropriate principles and patterns. suggestions: not required.",1219532,-1,8076
"The team has very well explained the steps they have planned to take for implementation of the functionality. They have stated every change they would be making for the Change request in details. They have also provided flow diagram for every actor involved and for every functionality they are going to implement.  However, the team has not explicitly mentioned the design pattern they are following for this implementation.",1220780,1,8076
" As the project is based upon making changes to the UI of the system , thus there is no such specific pattern being followed however the design that they have made available in the form of screenshots appear very much inclined with the functionalities that they need to implement .",1220439,1,8076
Design is good,1220404,-1,8076
"Yes, their design is very sound, and principles and patterns are used appropriately.",1220639,-1,8076
"1) The design appears to be sound. 2) Also follows proper design principles eg: for making changes to nomination and review questions, inheritance is used (inheriting methods from questions parent class)",1220007,-1,8076
The design seems to be appropriate and sound. It follows appropriate principles.,1220559,-1,8076
"Yes, the design appears to be very sound and follows all the principles that I know. I loved the format of the documentation as well.",1218779,-1,8076
" The design seems to be sound. There are a lot of mention of which files will be modified however, as I said in the previous round, there is no mention of the layout of the existing database or if the changes they will make currently will change the database. Suggestion: Team could mention what tables are present in the database of the Bacui project. I believe this will be really helpful since most of the reviewers are working on Expertiza projects and have no knowledge of Bacui projects. At the very least the team could mention which tables the project will be interacting with along with their structure.",1218918,1,8076
They have explained very well,1219486,-1,8076
Yes the design follows simple rails concepts and is pretty straightforward. I would like to see if the team uses existing gems available to speed up implementation and re use.   ,1219972,-1,8076
"Yes, looks clean. Any design patterns used????",1219947,1,8076
"Yes, the design appears to be sound and well made. ",1219193,-1,8076
"Yes, the design appears to be sound. There could be some rearrangement in the mock-up layout, e.g. text box for email address and 'Add' button could have the same horizontal alignment for a better user interface.",1220805,1,8076
The design seems to be very simple. I think the team has avoided unnecessary complications and are doing minimal changes to existing system to solve issues given to them.,1219533,-1,8076
The design approach seems justified and inline with the functionalities required to be implemented. They have mentioned step wise details for all the changes they are going to take. Done a good job. No rework required.,1220781,-1,8076
" Yes the design is presented in a much simpler form which gives a very clear picture of how the changes are going to be implemented and which functionalities would be witnessing the changes , also as they have provide the screenshots it enhances the understanding about the project more.",1220440,-1,8076
"Yes, their design is simple and clear enough to read and understand.",1220640,-1,8076
1) The design is simple and well modularized. 2) Each method is implementing only one task as it should.,1220008,-1,8076
The design does appear to be as simple as possible. The team have not unnecessarily complicated the project.,1220560,-1,8076
"Yes, the design is pretty simple and to the point. The design proposed is very clear and talk why each change is necessary.",1218780,-1,8076
 The design is straightforward and as simple as possible. The team has thought this project out very clearly and laid the same in the form of flowcharts and mock-ups. This has greatly reduced the complexity of the project and helped decrease the chances of clutter and confusion.,1218919,-1,8076
"Yes, adequate amount of details present",1219487,-1,8076
"Yes the design looks simple. The use of mock up screens is good and greatly helps understand the flow that has been proposed. Good work! How ever in one of the flow charts the check for ""Is Admin"" does not show/label  ""Y"" or ""N"" path",1219973,1,8076
Yes!  The requirements are simple and the design plan clearly explains all the points.,1219948,-1,8076
"yes, design appears to be very simple.",1219194,-1,8076
"Yes, the design is quite simple.",1220806,-1,8076
"Great use of UML diagrams, flowcharts and mock-ups by the team to clearly explain the flow of their work. It is easy to understand the flow and how the end product will look like.",1219534,-1,8076
They team has done awesome work in representing every detail possible in the flow diagrams. They have created UML diagrams which depicts the flow of the admin and students along with other actors. As mentioned earlier they have also represented the admin flow diagram and instructor flow diagram through the flow chart which makes it very easy for end user to understand the workflow of the requirements in the expertiza system.,1220782,-1,8076
 Yes the visualization is pretty clear and good.,1220441,-1,8076
Proper use of UML to explain the use cases and flow charts to explain the workflow has been done. The plan is complete.,1220406,-1,8076
"Yes, their visualization is good. They are clear and well described the changes.",1220641,-1,8076
"1) In the UML diagram the set of actions that the instructor can perform to add more than one question to nomination and textual type is not added. Also add the actions to modify the display sequence of existing questions. 2) In the instructor flow-chart, the flow for review questionnaire and to modify the display sequence of existing questions is missing.",1220009,1,8076
" The design document includes flow charts, UML diagrams and screenshots which is really impressive as it made the document easier to understand. ",1220561,-1,8076
I loved the overall use of the visualizations which aids to the understanding of the whole doc. The formatting of the documentation makes it really easy to read and understand.,1218781,-1,8076
"The diagrams seems to be good for most of the part. One can understand the project by looking at the diagrams itself. However, in one of the instructor flow diagram, it's given that if the instructor's status is pending the instructor will set the limit to 10. That doesn't make sense. Why would the instructor himself/herself set the limit to 10. Isn't this the responsibility of the system itself to handle this or at the most the admin? Suggestions: Change the 'yes' branch of is pending? to loop 10 times or somehow indicate that pending instructors can add only 10 students to an assignment.",1218920,1,8076
Yes the presence of use case diagrams and flow charts explaining the work flow is good. It would be nice if there were more uml diagrams such as sequence so show various class interactions.  Presence of mockup screens is good. That helps in understanding what is being implemented. It would have been good if the authors put in more details about the validations that that propose in the system ,1219974,1,8076
"Class diagrams are missing. Class diagrams are missing. First flow diagram looks perfect. Second needs some modifications - the instructor login flow should not include a step to set the count limit to 10. This should have been done before only. You should add a step to perform a check to see if the total students count is crossing the allowed limit(10). If yes, then don't add this new student and show some proper error message to the user. If no, then add the student.",1219949,1,8076
"Yes, the uml diagrams sufficiently provide visualization.",1219195,-1,8076
The authors have added UML diagrams as requested in the previous review and it has made a lot of difference. The explanation is much clearer now.,1220807,-1,8076
Test plan outlines the functionalities that the team will test and it seems sufficient to test the changes.,1219535,-1,8076
They team has done tremendous job in following the test driven approach for the project implementation. They have already included the tests they are writing for the functionality implementation. They have covered the exhaustive scenarios  for the project in their test. Their test plan is highly appreciative.,1220783,-1,8076
 The test plan is quite good as it covers all the test cases in the form of 11 test cases which test all the functionalities for the admin and the instructor role. It also considers the negative test cases like throwing an exception when the pending instructor tries to add more then 10 students to his/her course.,1220442,-1,8076
Tests can be made more exhaustive. For now it looks like only the view will be tested but controller should be tested as well.,1220407,1,8076
"Yes, they include the test plan.",1220642,-1,8076
1) The test cases cover all of the functionalities that they are going to implement.,1220010,-1,8076
"Yes, the document includes a test plan. There was no test plan present in the previous version of the design document but the team included the test plan in the second round. The test plan is clear and seems like it would really test the functionalities.",1220562,-1,8076
The test plan has been written in a very good way following the great quality of documentation till the end. It covers all the edge cases and scenarios.,1218782,-1,8076
The test plans are excellent. The best I have seen so far.It has accurately taken all test cases into consideration and described the layout of the final test in the form of a pseudo code. Well Done on the test plan!!,1218921,-1,8076
"Yes, test plans are included",1219489,-1,8076
I would the test section incomplete. The authors have mentioned about 11 test cases thats all. I think that is not at all sufficient. Also missing are unit tests if any and UI tests if any.  I would have liked mention of more test cases both automated as well as UI tests that will ensure basic sanity to the system,1219975,1,8076
"Yes, the test plan looks good. It covers all the functionalities.",1219950,-1,8076
Test plan seems thorough and well thought out.,1219196,-1,8076
The team is following a Test Driven Development approach. They have defined the test cases that need to be tested after the implementation. It seems to completely test the feature.,1220808,-1,8076
"The team has mentioned properly what changes they are doing and how they will be doing them. In the first submission they had suggested the possible approaches. Now, they are having a concrete way they are implementing these changes.",1219556,-1,8024
"Yes, and at times, much more than necessary! ",1219732,1,8024
Yes. The authors have made changes to the design document and are more specific about how exactly they plan to implement the new functionality.,1220503,-1,8024
No changes has been done,1219284,1,8024
"Yes, they explained a lot for the changes. Great job!",1219576,-1,8024
" The authors have done good job explaining the changes to be made to the system, and even explaining why other, more obvious options, are not chosen. It still sounds like a complicated change to make to the system.",1219112,1,8024
The team added more information from the last time which aided in a better explanation of the problem. Good job team,1220339,1,8024
1) The authors have adequately explained the changes to be made to the design document.,1220047,-1,8024
"The explanations are more than sufficient. Not only have the authors explained the changes to the system, but also explained the reasoning for considering those changes. I like the way that they also explained the other different ways they could've integrated the GitHub metrics but avoided those methods with sufficient reasoning for the same.The team has also given an explanation of their database design modifications would be like which is good.",1218733,1,8024
"Yes , excellent work done by the team. The design document adequately explains what is the problem that they are trying to solve, what is the proposed solution and how the solution would look like.  There are enough details to in the document to understand what is being done and what changes are proposed. The document also has enough illustrations on what is the current situation. ",1220001,-1,8024
The authors adequately explained the changes they plan to make.,1219699,-1,8024
The design seems to be sound. They have a sample design where they are explaining the tables and how they plan to work with them as well. The examples provided help understand how the data will be stored.,1219557,-1,8024
Yes,1219733,-1,8024
Yes. The team intends to use grade_controller to show github metric which would be a good place to implement this functionality. The idea to involve instructors because of a 60 requests/hour limit may complicate the project. Another idea would be to update metrics with a round robin scheduling of GET requests. ,1220504,1,8024
Yes,1219285,-1,8024
"Yes, they included some design principles, which is good. Maybe the authors could add some design patterns into wiki.",1219577,1,8024
 The design appears to be sound. They have weighed their options and are using an official gem to interact with the github api.,1219113,-1,8024
I don't see any issue in the design document. They have followed a good design principle.,1220340,-1,8024
1) The authors have mentioned several approaches in which these functionalities could be implemented. 2) Their chosen approach is follows MVC architecture and DRY principles.,1220048,-1,8024
"The design appears to be sound for most part of it. The linking between the different sections seems appropriate. The only issue I have is with the mock-up in the Design Details -> Second Change mock-up number 2. I think that the bar chart is being displayed for each and every day. I feel that is not only highly unnecessary but also would be very overwhelming for the instructor to process all this information because:-i) It is common knowledge that many students do not begin projects until a few days/weeks would have passed since the assignment is posted. So that would leave the initial few days of the bar chart empty with nothing valuable to show.ii) The duration of each project varies from project to project. Assignment 2 had a duration of about 20 -30 days. This would mean that there would be about 20 bar charts for each day which would be quite difficult for the TA/instructor to process for just one team let alone for so many other teams they need to evaluate. Suggestions: Instead of providing bar chart for each day aggregate it to a bar chart for each week or one in 5 days. And then maybe towards the deadline or like a week before the deadline you could switch to 1 barchart per day. OR Provide an option to switch between the scaling of time periods like a week, 5 days, 1 day etc.",1218734,1,8024
"Yes, the github api integration looks good. the only part missing was perhaps they could have documented the rest calls that they are going to make in the document as well. Usage of existing gems is good and eases lot of implementation pains  ",1220002,-1,8024
 The design sound very reasonable.  ,1219700,-1,8024
"The design is concise and clear. They have added reference images of how the system would look after their changes, which properly shows the expected implementation results.",1219558,-1,8024
Yes. It is thoroughly investigated.,1219734,-1,8024
The idea to involve instructors because of a 60 requests/hour limit may complicate the project. Another idea would be to update metrics with a round robin scheduling of GET requests. ,1220505,1,8024
Yes,1219286,-1,8024
"Their design is much simple and clear, also easy to understand.",1219578,-1,8024
"Yeah, I believe it is as simple as possible while choosing the best path for the expertiza project to grow, but it still sounds like a very ambitious project for 1 group to complete.",1219114,-1,8024
"With proper documentation, the problem is explained nicely and understanding of the complex problem is made easier.",1220341,-1,8024
 Their design is simple and clear.  ,1219701,-1,8024
"Yes, the authors are using already existing gems for the implementation. I would have liked to see a section on caching if any.  Rest the solution proposed looks simple and straightforward and looks that it will easily integrate into the current system  ",1220003,-1,8024
The design appears to be fairly simple. I think however there will be difficulty in implementing the GitHub metrics for latest data vs data before the submission deadlines.,1218735,1,8024
1) Have clearly mentioned when will GitHub Api be hit to retrive the data and which gem will be used.,1220049,1,8024
The use case diagram properly shows how the addition of this feature will help for the instructor role.,1219559,-1,8024
The visualizations used by the team are comprehensive and well made.,1220506,-1,8024
Good design,1219287,-1,8024
"excellent use of screenshots, made things very clear for me.",1219322,-1,8024
"Yes, they use a lot of diagrams to show use case.",1219579,-1,8024
 The photos included are superb at showing the expected View.  They can have more 1 or 2 more stars if most of the Expteriza work for the github metrics was already completed when they made these screen shots. Do you think it is feasible to expect that you can start a software project before getting a green light on the project in order to include high quality pictures of your proposed View in action?,1219115,1,8024
Use case diagram is present but it would have been nice to see a sequence diagram to understand the flow. ,1220342,1,8024
Explains the different approaches with the help of use case diagram.,1220050,-1,8024
"The use case diagram appears to be slightly incorrect. The symbol for an should be a stick figure not a rectangle. But that is a minor error. Also, the Use Case Diagram Details mention student as an actor but the diagram shows no instance of student as an actor. I think the Student as an actor shouldn't be included because in the current use case only the instructor is the primary actor and the assignment should have been submitted by the time the instructor views the scores, thus, requiring no involvement from the students at that point in time.Mention of Primary sequence in the Use Case Diagram Details seems highly unnecessary and potentially unrelated.",1218736,1,8024
There are enough aids such as uml diagrams and screen shots. The authors explicitly mention that there are no db changes so no need of an er diagram. Although I would have liked some class level details to be mentioned in the document that would help to dig more about the design changes,1220004,1,8024
 They not only use use case diagram but also mock-up screenshot to help the reader understand their design.  ,1219702,-1,8024
The test plan does include a high level of testing scenarios the team plans to cover. I would suggest the team should add BDD tests so they can test the same after the development phase is over.,1219560,-1,8024
"The test plan seems adequate at this stage, edge cases may need to be considered at a later stage.",1220507,-1,8024
No,1219288,-1,8024
few more test cases can be added,1219323,1,8024
"Yes, it includes the test plan with a great detail.",1219580,-1,8024
 The test plan seems adequate enough to show that they understand what to test.,1219116,-1,8024
Few test plan is written. The team can add more test plan.,1220343,1,8024
Good test plan. Should include more test cases that check the functionality of GitHub integration. eg: If number of lines of code committed by a student is correctly computed.,1220051,-1,8024
The design includes a test plan. However the test plan has nothing related to tests or which test cases are going to be considered. It just explains the flow of how an instructor would reach the GitHub metrics data page.The team should at least mention which files are the test cases going to be written on and what functionalities are they going to test.,1218737,-1,8024
"The test section looks inadequate as of now, only two test scenarios are mentioned and no details on automation or UI.  More so no mention of tests in the document.",1220005,-1,8024
 Test plans for both of their subtasks were present.  ,1219703,-1,8024
"The author has excellently explained about the changes that they would be making by providing the design diagram and the screenshot of the the changes that they have incorporated .Also they have mentioned about their choice of tool which is google chart and why do they prefer , so overall a good explanation",1220478,-1,8090
Changes that's needs to be made has been explained correctly.,1220543,-1,8090
"Yes, their doc has adequately explained the changes.",1220658,-1,8090
The team have a well written design document and and the authors have explained the proposed changes well. The authors have also listed each file they are going to be changed.,1220673,-1,8090
"yes, the team has well explained the changes that they are going to make. Last time it was a bit confusing but this time because of the help of the diagrams and mock UI screen, the solution seems clear now.",1219722,-1,8090
The authors have explained the changes made to the system. The design flow greatly helps to understand the flow of the system.,1220259,-1,8090
The authors have described what all changes they plan to do and where they plan to do it. Compared to the previous version of the design document they have now included what tools and framework they plan to work on. The design document looks complete and understandable now.,1219814,-1,8090
They will be changing mostly html and erb code to create a visual interface that delivers information to instructors more effectively.,1219596,-1,8090
The proposed changes have been explained in a simple manner.,1219097,-1,8090
"The document adequately describes the project description and proposals made. The proposed change of generating a single or single bar chart graph based on the categories selected to display the chart, can be efficiently made to the system.",1220453,-1,8090
They have improved the document to provide a better description of changes to be made to the system.,1219227,-1,8090
Yes the design is sound and gives a proper explanation about how their implementation would behave.,1220479,-1,8090
Design seems correct.,1220544,-1,8090
"Yes, their design is clear and sound, and the principles and patterns are well used.",1220659,-1,8090
The design documents is well explained. the authors haven't mentioned any design pattern as such. The authors have clearly stated the proposed changes though. they could have added uml and crc cards.,1220674,-1,8090
yeah their design seems to be sound and neat.,1219723,-1,8090
System is well defined ,1220260,-1,8090
"The document is really descriptive about what work needs to be done. However, I would suggest them to properly structure the document. One finds it really difficult to understand the flow of the document.",1219815,1,8090
The design document is good and I don't think any design pattern needs to be followed as very few changes are being made. ,1219098,-1,8090
"The design makes use of the Google charts tool to generate visual charts for specific criteria set. Based on the design flow, it appears that the functionality can be consistently performed to generate the visual graph for the instructor.",1220454,-1,8090
"Yes, the design appears to be sound and uses appropriate design principles.",1219228,-1,8090
Yes the design is pretty simple and inclusion of screenshot enhances the clarity of what the team has achieved in terms of the required changes. ,1220480,-1,8090
Design is simple and easy to understand.,1220545,-1,8090
"Yes, the design is simple and easy to understand. I can easily know what they will do through their doc.",1220660,-1,8090
The design appears to be very simple and well written. They have explained the use case diagram very well. also they have added visualizations.,1220675,-1,8090
"yes, the design is simple and easy to understand ",1219724,-1,8090
The team is using external tools to do the work and its clear and easy,1220261,-1,8090
"The document is really simple to understand once you get to understand the flow. However, initially it appears to be difficult.",1219816,1,8090
Using google charts is a good idea.,1219598,-1,8090
"Actual project work has not been started yet, so code modifications have not been mentioned yet. But the files to be changed seem appropriate for the project objective.",1219099,1,8090
"From the reasons provided for choosing the Google charts tool, and it's effectiveness, it can be integrated into the system functionality easily making the design simpler to be executed.",1220455,-1,8090
"Yes, design involves google charts API and seems very simple.",1219229,-1,8090
Yes the design flow and the screenshots very clearly describes the changes made to the system.,1220481,-1,8090
Flow diagram explains the flow correctly.,1220546,-1,8090
"Yes, they have used visualization to help people understand their design.",1220661,-1,8090
The bar charts have been added to the design report. The visualizations have been added to views also and the screen shots have been added too. The only thing that I would like to add is that the bar charts could have been more descriptive. As in they could have added details for  x label and y label and also put legend. this will aid the user in quickly understanding what the chart is conveying.  ,1220676,1,8090
They have worked on their weak point. Earlier their solution does not seem cogent but I would say now they have made good progress.,1219725,-1,8090
The sample data visualizations is good. The way they have given visualizations for sample data is nice. easier to understand and good.,1220262,-1,8090
"The document does include a flowchart which shows the flow of changes. However, an UML diagram would have made the document more understandable and easy to follow.",1219817,1,8090
The team already has mockups for their design.,1219599,-1,8090
"The visualization is great, the screenshots clearly indicate the proposed output of the project.",1219100,-1,8090
The team has not included any additional diagrams apart from the flow diagram provided in the first stage. The flow diagram effectively describes the sequence of actions that need to be taken so that the instructor can view the bar graph visual representation for the selected criteria set.,1220456,1,8090
Really good visualization provided.,1219230,-1,8090
Functionality features test has been included but plan for RSpec tests is yet to be included.,1220547,1,8090
"Yes, they did include the test plan, but it's not enough, if just including files.",1220662,1,8090
The project does not have any testing involved as such. But the authors have added a testing plan.,1220677,1,8090
"According to the team ""The specification of the project does not require us to use automated tests"" but they plan to test the modified ruby code or the new features using the RSpec testing framework. Overall, the test  plan sounds good ",1219726,-1,8090
No tests are required for the project as stated,1220263,-1,8090
"The test plan section is included, however, only the framework to be used is discussed. I would suggest them to include a little more brief description about what test cases they plan to include and work on.",1219818,1,8090
This team did not require any tests.,1219600,-1,8090
The design document does not include a test plan as testing requirement is very minimal since most changes are in view.,1219101,-1,8090
"The test plan section specifies that it does not require performing any automated tests. However, since the new functionality of adding a visual diagram, the team would modified ruby code for the functions added to the grades_controller.",1220457,-1,8090
"They have mentioned that they will be using Rspec framework, but have not given what tests they will be implementing and hence can not comment if tests will be shallow or not. ",1219231,1,8090
"The authors have lucidly explained the changes that are to be made to the system. They show the current state of the system and the expected state which includes a new button to Analyze the review content in the segmented text box. The authors have specified 2 files that they plan to modify namely the view file response.html.erb and a partial _self_review.html.erb. The team clearly show the format of the response popup with suggestion metrics that capture sentiment score, sentiment tone, whether suggestions are present or not, chance of suggestions, volume of text and the volume of text without stop words. They also propose to improve the response time of extracting the output from the API.One suggestion is that the team could have touched upon the working of the suggestion detection algorithm though it is not part of their current implementation. They do mention that it is a black box and have included a link to the deployed NLP project for suggestion algorithm, where users can test the suggestion metrics generated for custom text.",1219327,1,8047
"The authors have explained the scope of the project pretty well. But as I mentioned in the earlier review, a whole paragraph on the background of expertiza is not required, one or two sentences would have sufficed.",1220112,1,8047
The authors have given sufficiently good explanation for the changes to be made to the system. They have explained which files they will change as well as the flow of the project.One thing that they have failed to mention is what API are they planning to use. I would like to know that as that would be a key piece of information for this document's completeness.,1218907,1,8047
"The authors have worked well since the last review and incorporated some of the suggestions. They have now finalized the input and output formats. However, I still am unsure about the algorithm implementation they have proposed. They have kept it as a black box, which makes the design quite inadequate. It becomes difficult to review if their methods, classes are in the right direction or need any modification. They should have at least given a high level overview of the algorithm. Also, I have observed that the additional comments box also contains valuable suggestions many of the times. Please mention if you have considered the additional comments box in your analyze functionality.",1219709,1,8047
"The authors mention within their UML diagrams section that they are making only HTML changes, however, they have still not explained how the requests will be sent, no explanation has been given yet on how the team intends to implement timing the response of the API.",1220474,1,8047
The document does not mention the name of the design pattern used but clearly mentions the steps to be done in order to implement the required functionalities.,1220088,1,8047
"They explained from their requirements and in their flow, that they only need to plan to edit the View, so there is no need for a UML.",1218928,1,8047
Documentation is proper. Team could have added DB tables as well in the design doc.,1218749,1,8047
"Keeping the suggestion detection algorithm as a black box, as stated in the design document I will comment on the input and output to the algorithm. The input will be a text block of the review comments to the algorithm, and the output is consisting of different fields such as sentiment score, sentiment analysis as positive/negative, suggestion as present or absent. However, it is unclear to me as to what basis (the suggestion detection algorithm details/explanation/high level overview) do you classify the data into suggestion classifier.",1219710,1,8047
"Yes, design seems fit. More insight required on the algorithm itself and how it will be implemented.",1220108,1,8047
"The complexity is again a big unknown to me, as they have kept the algorithm as a black box. It is unclear where the algorithm changes are to be implemented, if it is in a controller, and if yes, in which controller. I suggest the authors to provide internal details of the algorithm in order to understand their proposed solution better. As of now, I am clear about their input and output formats, however I would like to know which functions do they interface with.",1219711,1,8047
Can't say as code is not visible.,1220109,1,8047
"There were mock-ups of how the Analyze button would be displayed along side each rubric, however there is no mock-up for how the response would be displayed.Suggestions: I would like to see where and how would that response be displayed because from the flow diagram the response seems to be quite big. I would like to also know if the team is planing to display all the components of the response from the API or just a few.",1218910,1,8047
"The visualization includes a screen mock-up ""Analyze""  button which will implement the algorithm and produce the output. However, there is no mock-up of the screen of what will the output be like. The flow diagram is highly redundant according to me, as it does not portray any additional information about the design. I would suggest them to provide a sequence diagram of the algorithm methods, so as to illustrate their changes.",1219712,1,8047
"There is a test plan for part one of the problem state, however no implementation plan or test plan for part two.",1220477,1,8047
I think more tests can be added,1219298,1,8047
The document mentions the detailed test case that needs to be done but not how it will be done.,1220091,1,8047
The team has included test plan in Connextra format by including the feature specification and two scenarios- one happy path and one to capture the edge case of response generated with no text. No more test cases can be added to check if the team's part in the project is implemented well. Some test case scenarios that check the efficiency of the suggestion detection algorithm (for example: to detect review responses that generate the generalized suggestion for all the projects) can be included.,1219331,1,8047
"The design document has incorporated test plans, but they haven't been explained neatly. Only the skeleton for the tests has been provided, they've should have at least added one actual test code for the reviewer to verify.",1220116,1,8047
"Their test plan includes a test case for successfully displaying the pop-up text message as JSON, and displaying suggestion metrics for the review segment( a block of review, a comment box). Try to include test cases where a review message is absent, i.e. the code should not break for empty review segment. Include a test case where review segment has a suggestion, and test if the output says ""Suggestion present"". Include a negative test case for the the suggestion, where a suggestion is not given by the reviewer, and test that the output says ""suggestion absent"".",1219713,1,8047
"Yes, changes to be made are explained clearly. Document is very clear, includes necessary diagrams, mock-ups and everything possible to make anyone understand what the issues are and what team is planning to do to resolve them. Everything is included in a proper order like for each issue there is a separate flowchart and mock-up. No suggestions required.",1219861,-1,8020
yes the authors have adaquately explained the changes to be made in the system.,1220393,-1,8020
The document is clearly and neatly written. All the necessary sections are present with good explanations.,1220568,-1,8020
Changes are well explained with good visual aids.,1219117,-1,8020
"They have explained every change they want to make to fix the issue. The diagrams, in turn, help a lot to understand the flow of the system.",1219217,-1,8020
Yes the authors have adequately explained all the changes that need to be made. Each issue has a separate list of changes to be made and which files need to be edited.,1220857,-1,8020
The changes are very well documented. For each issue what are the files that needs to be changed is mentioned appropriately. The overall design looks efficient and avoids any duplication. Good Job!,1220127,-1,8020
"Both the problems and proposed changes are clearly detailed. My only suggestion is to put the description of the issue being solved in the same location as the solution to it, otherwise one has to scroll around the page to figure out which problem is being fixed.",1220212,1,8020
"Yes, they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection. They have not only given proper UML diagrams and the like, but they have also implemented the code and showcased in the ""Test Plan"" and the ""Proposed Design"" section. ",1218942,-1,8020
"In round one, Team has well explained their approach and how are they going to do it. In this round, they have included detailed information and mock UI. It was easy to relate their approach. Their test plan is also thorough. I think the team would definitely be able to incorporate the new changes. Good job guys! ",1219352,-1,8020
The design was well explained in this design doc.,1220498,-1,8020
"Well explanation on problem statement. UML diagrams, flow charts given. Detailed explanation on problem statement. ",1220147,-1,8020
yes!,1220583,-1,8020
"Yes, the document seems to be perfect. It does follow all the appropriate principles and patterns. No suggestions required.",1219862,-1,8020
design is fine. some minor errors like no stop phase.Moreover no design patterns used. Just flowcharts are provided.If some sequence diagram or use case diagrams were provided it would improve the design a lot.,1220394,1,8020
"As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.",1220569,-1,8020
The design is apt following the principles and are self-explanatory,1219218,-1,8020
Yes the design appears to be sound and the flow diagrams illustrate the flow of control very well.,1220858,-1,8020
Yes the design is pretty good. The patterns followed avoids any duplication of code. But I had made a suggestion in Review One to take a look at Project 1843 and it's code. The problem statement is quite similar and the code could be reused. I don't see any mention of it. I hope you do take a look before starting to code as it will avoid any re-work.,1220128,1,8020
All good design principles are being followed where necessary.,1220213,-1,8020
The design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the Logical Flow diagram they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the Proposed Design section so as to elucidate the problem statement.,1218943,-1,8020
The design appears to be neat. ,1219353,-1,8020
The design appears to be sound following the appropriate principles and patterns. ,1220499,-1,8020
"Yes, well designed document. UI mock-ups given. It is structured. ",1220148,-1,8020
sound. so many diagrams.,1220584,-1,8020
"Yes, it is the simplest design and minimal work which is required to resolve the issues. It is very clearly explained. One can clearly understand the problem statement and the proposed solution for the same. The design document is properly structured as well. ",1219863,-1,8020
design is simple and easy to understand.,1220395,-1,8020
"Yes, simple straightforward solutions.",1220570,-1,8020
The diagrams are very basic and covering the entire scope which is a good work by the team,1219219,-1,8020
Yes the design is robust and simple to understand. Each class and view only handles a specific functionality i.e it is modularised.,1220859,-1,8020
Yes the design is straight forward and easy to understand.,1220129,-1,8020
The design appears to be simple given the task at hand.,1220214,-1,8020
"Yes, the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the staggered deadlines assignment section. ",1218944,-1,8020
"Undoubtedly, I like their color coding approach. It's something very simple and apt for the current system.",1219354,-1,8020
The design seems simple and clear. ,1220500,-1,8020
Design is informative. But too detailed. One UML would have been apt.,1220149,1,8020
very clear,1220585,-1,8020
"Yes, the provided diagrams deliver sufficient information about the implementation. Flowcharts and mock UIs screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required changes. No suggestions required.",1219864,-1,8020
The team has discussed their plan using flowcharts. But they have not used any class diagram.,1219827,1,8020
flowcharts are drawn which describe the flow how the system will work after implementation.,1220396,-1,8020
Great use of mock ups. Really appreciate it.,1220571,-1,8020
"Yes, they have added mock UI screenshots which is exactly what they are going to and should do.",1219220,-1,8020
Yes the diagrams clearly illustrate the proposed flow. Different diagrams are provided for different issues. One of the best wikis I have seen,1220860,-1,8020
Very good use of Class and Sequence diagrams to explain the entire design flow. It clearly conveys the thought  process of authors and the overall design.,1220130,-1,8020
Lots of great visualizations are provided that outline a good amount of detail.,1220215,-1,8020
"Yes, the diagrams are clear to show how the system works. But they, are not so lucid so as to show in the diagram how they are going to implement the changes in the system.   ",1218945,1,8020
The team has added their mock UI which shows they have thought about the changes and modification. Mock UIs of the screen shows they are halfway the project. ,1219355,-1,8020
"The class diagram is very useful, and the mock UI with indication on it make it more useful. ",1220501,1,8020
"Yes, design is informative. Change proposal is detailed. It describes well about how changes are to be implemented.",1220150,-1,8020
The diagram is perfect and clear,1220586,-1,8020
"Yes, design does include a well-described test plan. The provided tests will surely test the functionalities which will be implemenedt. The test plan is represented in a wonderful manner including pre-steps and different testing expectations. Great work. No suggestions are required.",1219865,-1,8020
The design includes test plan.On the testb plan provided it seems like they will test the functionalities. But nothing mentioned on how they will write.,1220397,1,8020
The test plan is comprehensive.,1220572,-1,8020
They have covered all the test plans along with detailed steps.,1219221,-1,8020
"Yes the design includes the test plan. However, the test plan could have been more low level, instead of just writing 'it should' statements.",1220861,1,8020
A through test-plan is described. I do think Test Case-2 could be described more efficiently so that it is clear and easy to understand. Overall looks good.,1220131,1,8020
The test plan is thorough and contains lots of detail that will make it easy to design RSpec tests in the future.,1220216,-1,8020
"The Test Plans are thorough and they gone ahead and shown it in detail by breaking them into steps such as pre-steps, Functional, UI and Performance Testing. This is a very good way to achieve in-depth analysis of the problem and check how effective the solution is.",1218946,-1,8020
"I have to say their test plan includes user interface testing, performance testing, database testing etc. I have to say they have worked really hard for it. I have not yet come across any team who has a test plan like this. ",1219356,-1,8020
An appropriate test plan is included in this design doc. ,1220502,-1,8020
yes the test coverage seems good,1220587,-1,8020
"After the first review, the design has improved significantly. The proposed design clearly defines the changes being made by the team.",1220814,-1,8082
Not enough explanation,1219289,1,8082
"Yes, the proposed solutions part clearly stated that they will go through each review to compare the new review score, etc, and then they will store the review URL. However, the solution is not concrete enough and is a little bit hard to follow. It should be great if there's more details in stating about how to loop through each reviews.  ",1220157,-1,8082
"They have a paragraph saying what they are going to do, but it could be broken up into parts with images for better understanding",1218891,-1,8082
"The authors have explained well what changes they wish to make and how they plan to implement those changes. I would suggest them to add more details like, ""where do they store the list of responses more than the notification threshold"". Overall good job.",1219871,-1,8082
A format of the proposed email to be sent would be helpful,1219311,-1,8082
"No, their didn't include enough text explanation.",1220668,1,8082
"Yes, they include this part in the Proposed Solutions field. It would be better if they use visualization to let the readers better understand the flow.",1220217,-1,8082
Not well structured and less content,1219500,1,8082
The team has provided a code snippet which includes solution to their problem statement. They have described the code and their proposed changes,1219470,-1,8082
I know exactly what this team is doing.,1219586,-1,8082
"The design document contains all the necessary sections but fails to provide adequate explanation of the changes to be made. The authors have done a good job at explaining the current scenario, also identified the code where the changes are to be made. They have identified the need of a new function and its purpose, but fail to provide a design of the intended changes, i.e. new functions or modifications in the functions, any need to use different variables etc. The authors have not added any changes relevant to the previous suggestions.",1219621,1,8082
"Yes, the problem statement and the proposed changes have been clearly explained.",1220274,-1,8082
The design has improved and updates has been done and it is easy to comprehend the changes to be made to the system.,1220344,-1,8082
There has been a significant improvement in the level of details provided. The author can further improve the document by providing the details of the design pattern to be used.,1220815,-1,8082
Design is okay,1219290,-1,8082
"The design is sound because it follows the problem statement and the instructions. I doubt if it follows the DRY principle while looping through each review, because that might be already done in the Expertiza. In terms of patterns, I think here it needs to use the factory pattern, altough it's not stated in the design.",1220158,1,8082
"Design does seem to be sound, but complex. As mentioned in the earlier review, I am unsure if looping over each review is the correct thing to do or not. Maybe the team discussed this with the mentor and decided against it as no new information has been added in the document. If so, I would only suggest the team to include the complexity of the design in the document.",1219872,-1,8082
"Yes, but they didnt show their principles and pattern very well.",1220669,1,8082
"The design seems workable. Maybe they can come up a more sound design. For example, they can try many ways to define the notification limit.",1220218,-1,8082
"By looking at the flow-charts and UML diagrams submitted by the team, their solution appears to be sound.",1219471,-1,8082
It seems as though this team's approach was well designed.,1219587,-1,8082
"As they have provided a very high-level idea of their proposed solution, there is no pseudocode or any class diagram which helps explain the design adequately. You can improvise the design by including flow of the methods, to highlight how and where will your new method come into picture. However, looking at the intended modifications, it seems that the changes follow DRY principles, and changes are not unnecessary. There is also no need of using any design patterns as per the required changes.",1219622,1,8082
Author could have provided the design pattern they need to implement.,1220345,1,8082
The design seems to be pretty straightforward.,1220816,-1,8082
Very basic design,1219291,1,8082
"The design is simple, although it could be better if it has more concrete examples.",1220159,-1,8082
"Yes, the design is as simple as it can get. Understanding the principle is not hard. But making it simple should also not make it costly. Good work to the team if the instructors were looking for something this simple :)",1219873,-1,8082
"Yes, it simple but some parts are not easy to understand.",1220670,-1,8082
The design is simple and really better than before.,1220219,-1,8082
The team has provided diagrams that make it easier for the reader to understand the workflow of the system and the changes that they have proposed to implement the solution.,1219472,-1,8082
"The way the team plans to loop through each review to calculate a review score seems slightly more complex than necessary, but I agree with them taking this apporach as it will allow them to break down the reason why the scores are different.",1219588,-1,8082
"The design does appear to be simple, as they have not planned to modify any of the existing methods. Their new method will interact with Response, AssignmentQuestionnaire model, and then link the assignment to the review in the email. However, they have not mentioned if they have planned any data structure/variable to store the assignment link and pass it on to the method where email notification will be sent. But, i suppose that storing it in a variable will suffice. ",1219623,-1,8082
"The design and application flow appear to be as simple as possible, as well as the proposed code changes snippet provided.",1220276,-1,8082
The design seems simple.,1220346,-1,8082
The author uses the UML diagram to properly describe the system. ,1220817,-1,8082
No visualization,1219292,1,8082
"There are a lot of diagrams, but the application flow and the UML Diagram doesn't look very clear. We can hardly see the words in the UML Diagram. Also, the diagrams seem to not fit each other. How does the application diagram and the Uml diagram connect to each other? There's no clear instructions. Also, I don't think a screen shot of code in the design doc is a good idea. I think it could be better if the changes expected to be made can be described in a more abstract fashion. ",1220160,1,8082
"The UML diagrams given in the document list the process flow for testing/understanding the changes which will be made in the document. But, unfortunately, no diagram exists which describe the changes to be made.   I would suggest the team to add diagrams for the pseudo-code they may have written.",1219874,1,8082
"Yes, the use of visualization is great.",1220671,-1,8082
"They used the UML diagrams, it really help me a lot when reading the wiki page. Maybe they can also make diagrams about the changes they are going to make.",1220220,-1,8082
"As mentioned, the team has provided UML diagrams stating the two actors in their system- Student, Instructor and their interaction with the email module and database.",1219473,-1,8082
"The visualization aids used currently are application flow diagram, and use cases. They are useful to understand the scenario of the problem statement. However, a sequence or a communication diagram will really be beneficial to understand how the method interfaces with the other  methods. This will help identify if the new method impacts other functionalities and will portray the proposed solution efficiently.",1219624,-1,8082
"There are UML and application flow diagrams included with the design document, which serve to make the proposed design changes much clearer.",1220277,-1,8082
Proper diagrams are used by the team. ,1220347,-1,8082
The document does contain a test plan which can definitely be extended to incorporate certain negative test cases.,1220818,-1,8082
No test plan,1219293,1,8082
"There's a testing plan. Although the testing plan seems to cover the fuctionalities, it is not clearly stated. The tester should log in as what role? how to select a teams assignment and review it? How to log out and check the instructor's email? which instructor email should the tester check? These questions should have been answered in the test plan.",1220161,1,8082
They have one scenario. maybe a few more could help better test their work,1218895,-1,8082
"The test plan section unfortunately lists no concrete test that the team would write. Checking the functionality manually, and writing rspec tests for the code written are extremely different, and I would suggest the team to have a dedicated test plan section, mentioning the controller/model they wish to test, the objects they would need to mock etc.",1219875,1,8082
some additional tests can be added,1219315,-1,8082
"Yes, the doc contains test plan, but they are not specific.",1220672,1,8082
They did include a test plan. It would be better if they also test the instructor side.,1220221,-1,8082
The test plan seems overly simplistic. It only tests whether the team's changes work in the most drastic scenario possible. It seems like they should have more boundary value tests and more test cases to account for their new method of looping through the reviews to compare new reviews with previous ones.,1219590,-1,8082
"I think that there is a huge scope for test plan improvisation. The current test plan is just a step-by-step procedure to test if the reviewer receives a mail fir conflicting reviews. The test plan should also include test cases to test whether the link is present in the email notification. Also, is the link correct and navigable? The test plan should also cover the pits where the functionality may fail, so as to ensure smooth functioning of the system.",1219625,1,8082
Test plan is as simple as required for the problem statement in question.,1220278,-1,8082
Design doc includes the test plan but more detail on negative test cases would have been better.,1220348,-1,8082
Yes. The authors do have an adequate explanation. ,1220473,-1,8046
they have also added the UML diagrams which makes things a lot more clearer,1219294,-1,8046
"I cannot remember what the explanation looked like last week, but the read through this week felt very clear. The organization of the article felt like it followed the logic of a design project. The problem statement felt like it was reduced to a clear, concise, set of requirements that are attainable. The addition of the program flow diagram and an explanation as to why there is no UML diagram also helped to cement my understanding and set my expectations.",1218927,-1,8046
Good work on adding UML diagrams. Now the problem is very well explained.,1218748,-1,8046
"The authors have lucidly explained the changes that are to be made to the system. They show the current state of the system and the expected state which includes a new button to Analyze the review content in the segmented text box. The authors have specified 2 files that they plan to modify namely the view file response.html.erb and a partial _self_review.html.erb. The team clearly show the format of the response popup with suggestion metrics that capture sentiment score, sentiment tone, whether suggestions are present or not, chance of suggestions, volume of text and the volume of text without stop words. They also propose to improve the response time of extracting the output from the API.One suggestion is that the team could have touched upon the working of the suggestion detection algorithm though it is not part of their current implementation. They do mention that it is a black box and have included a link to the deployed NLP project for suggestion algorithm, where users can test the suggestion metrics generated for custom text.",1219327,-1,8046
"The authors have explained the scope of the project pretty well. But as I mentioned in the earlier review, a whole paragraph on the background of expertiza is not required, one or two sentences would have sufficed.",1220112,1,8046
yes they have explained it very well.,1219031,-1,8046
The authors have given sufficiently good explanation for the changes to be made to the system. They have explained which files they will change as well as the flow of the project.One thing that they have failed to mention is what API are they planning to use. I would like to know that as that would be a key piece of information for this document's completeness.,1218907,1,8046
The changes proposed are well explained and clearly indicate the intended output.,1219197,-1,8046
The authors have adequately explained changes made to the system. They have explained the problem and proposed solution clearly and supported it with appopriate diagrams.,1219921,-1,8046
"The authors have worked well since the last review and incorporated some of the suggestions. They have now finalized the input and output formats. However, I still am unsure about the algorithm implementation they have proposed. They have kept it as a black box, which makes the design quite inadequate. It becomes difficult to review if their methods, classes are in the right direction or need any modification. They should have at least given a high level overview of the algorithm. Also, I have observed that the additional comments box also contains valuable suggestions many of the times. Please mention if you have considered the additional comments box in your analyze functionality.",1219709,1,8046
Very detailed and precise. Solution explained thoroughly. ,1220107,-1,8046
"The authors mention within their UML diagrams section that they are making only HTML changes, however, they have still not explained how the requests will be sent, no explanation has been given yet on how the team intends to implement timing the response of the API.",1220474,1,8046
The document does not mention the name of the design pattern used but clearly mentions the steps to be done in order to implement the required functionalities.,1220088,1,8046
"They explained from their requirements and in their flow, that they only need to plan to edit the View, so there is no need for a UML.",1218928,-1,8046
Documentation is proper. Team could have added DB tables as well in the design doc.,1218749,-1,8046
"Yes, the design is sound and clear. Majority of the work is done by the suggestion algorithm. The team proposes to integrate this functionality into Expertiza and also improve the response time. This project does not need to incorporate any design pattern as only the view files are altered. The project does not impact the degree to which it is object oriented.",1219328,1,8046
"Since the task is to integrate a web service in the existing system, the design mentioned is sound and reasonably primitive. ",1220113,-1,8046
yes it does based on the proposed solution.,1219032,-1,8046
"The design is good. However, there is no scope of using bad principles since the number of files that will be affected are minimal and restricted to just 2.",1218908,-1,8046
The design doc is sound and I believe no design patterns are required for this project.,1219198,-1,8046
The design appears sound.,1219922,-1,8046
"Keeping the suggestion detection algorithm as a black box, as stated in the design document I will comment on the input and output to the algorithm. The input will be a text block of the review comments to the algorithm, and the output is consisting of different fields such as sentiment score, sentiment analysis as positive/negative, suggestion as present or absent. However, it is unclear to me as to what basis (the suggestion detection algorithm details/explanation/high level overview) do you classify the data into suggestion classifier.",1219710,1,8046
"Yes, design seems fit. More insight required on the algorithm itself and how it will be implemented.",1220108,-1,8046
"Yes, the design in its current form seems straight forward.",1220475,-1,8046
"The Requirements were distilled down to the fewest simple terms possible without over-generalization. It felt like they just gave me the tl;dr statement without any fluffy words to waste my time, and also feels like they have a strong grasp over what they are expected to accomplish.",1218929,-1,8046
"Yes, the design appears to be simple. ",1218750,-1,8046
"Yes the design is simple and illustrated well with the use of wireframes showing the current, expected state and UML diagram showing the flow diagram. It depicts that once the Analyze button is clicked, the request is sent as JSON which contains the text typed by reviewer in the segmented textbox to the API which generates the suggestion metrics. The response contains the suggestion metrics like sentiment score, sentiment tone, presence of suggestions, chance of suggestion, total volume of text and volume of text without stop words. ",1219329,-1,8046
"Yes, the design is simple and clear. The task is to integrate a web service which returns a result in JSON format.",1220114,-1,8046
yes it does appear to be simple as possible.,1219033,-1,8046
The design is as simple as it could be since the flow of logic is pretty linear and there is no scope of complexity. The changes also seems to be restricted to just one file which is good and in keeping with sound principles.,1218909,-1,8046
The actual project work might not have been started yet so the code modifications have not been mentioned. But the files to be modified seem appropriate.,1219199,-1,8046
The design appears very simple.,1219923,-1,8046
"The complexity is again a big unknown to me, as they have kept the algorithm as a black box. It is unclear where the algorithm changes are to be implemented, if it is in a controller, and if yes, in which controller. I suggest the authors to provide internal details of the algorithm in order to understand their proposed solution better. As of now, I am clear about their input and output formats, however I would like to know which functions do they interface with.",1219711,1,8046
Can't say as code is not visible.,1220109,1,8046
The project does not necessarily need diagramatic explanations but UML diagrams have been used which show implementation plan fairly well.,1220476,-1,8046
The Flow diagram mentioned in the document clearly explains the changes need to be done.,1220090,-1,8046
the screenshots of the Expertiza system are very helpful in understanding the problem and the solution,1219297,-1,8046
The program flow diagram and an explanation as to why there is no UML diagram also helped to cement my understanding and set my expectations.,1218930,-1,8046
UML diagram explains the changes.,1218751,-1,8046
"Yes, this team has made the best use of visualization tools that can be applied to their project. They have clearly shown wireframes of the current response page juxtaposed with the expected state with the Analyze button next to each rubric. The document also includes the flow of the project represented as UML diagram. Once the Analyze button is clicked the request text is sent to the suggestion detection algorithm. The API returns the response which contains the suggestion metrics like sentiment score, sentiment tone, presence of suggestions, chance of suggestion, total volume of text and volume of text without stop words. ",1219330,-1,8046
"The use of visualization is not pivotal for this task as it can be explained theoretically as well. But still, the team has made an effort to present the task with help of a flow diagram.",1220115,-1,8046
"yes, very well explained.",1219034,-1,8046
"There were mock-ups of how the Analyze button would be displayed along side each rubric, however there is no mock-up for how the response would be displayed.Suggestions: I would like to see where and how would that response be displayed because from the flow diagram the response seems to be quite big. I would like to also know if the team is planing to display all the components of the response from the API or just a few.",1218910,1,8046
The screenshots clearly display where the output would be displayed.,1219200,-1,8046
The UML diagrams clearly descibes the design of the solution. The screenshots explain changes required in the system adequately.,1219924,-1,8046
"The visualization includes a screen mock-up ""Analyze""  button which will implement the algorithm and produce the output. However, there is no mock-up of the screen of what will the output be like. The flow diagram is highly redundant according to me, as it does not portray any additional information about the design. I would suggest them to provide a sequence diagram of the algorithm methods, so as to illustrate their changes.",1219712,1,8046
Yes UML diagram is provided and it is detailed. Flow diagrams explains how suggestions will be given. ,1220110,-1,8046
"There is a test plan for part one of the problem state, however no implementation plan or test plan for part two.",1220477,1,8046
I think more tests can be added,1219298,-1,8046
The document mentions the detailed test case that needs to be done but not how it will be done.,1220091,1,8046
"The use cases appear to offer a quality, general test approach to see if their design does what it should.",1218931,-1,8046
Test cases have been added. ,1218752,-1,8046
The team has included test plan in Connextra format by including the feature specification and two scenarios- one happy path and one to capture the edge case of response generated with no text. No more test cases can be added to check if the team's part in the project is implemented well. Some test case scenarios that check the efficiency of the suggestion detection algorithm (for example: to detect review responses that generate the generalized suggestion for all the projects) can be included.,1219331,-1,8046
"The design document has incorporated test plans, but they haven't been explained neatly. Only the skeleton for the tests has been provided, they've should have at least added one actual test code for the reviewer to verify.",1220116,1,8046
"the tests given tests there changes, which is enough.",1219035,-1,8046
The test plan is complete. The team plans to test the two possible cases:1. When the review is blank. Response should be no review in text box.2. When review is present response is the result of suggestion metrics analysis. The team is right in testing just these two cases because they should not test if the API itself is returning a correct response as that would be against testing rules.,1218911,-1,8046
the test cases seem appropriate given that the only thing which needs to be tested is if the suggestion detection algorithm is displaying the intended output or not.,1219201,-1,8046
The design doc includes the test plan which covers changes in the functionalities.,1219925,-1,8046
"Their test plan includes a test case for successfully displaying the pop-up text message as JSON, and displaying suggestion metrics for the review segment( a block of review, a comment box). Try to include test cases where a review message is absent, i.e. the code should not break for empty review segment. Include a test case where review segment has a suggestion, and test if the output says ""Suggestion present"". Include a negative test case for the the suggestion, where a suggestion is not given by the reviewer, and test that the output says ""suggestion absent"".",1219713,-1,8046
Yes. Functional tests with scenarios provided.,1220111,-1,8046
authors adequately explained the changes to be made to the system but it would have been better if they have provided how and what model dependency needs to be implemented to achieve the goal.   ,1220759,1,8100
"The explanation is inadequate, needs more textual explanation of the problem and approach",1220769,1,8100
Good additions on the purpose and use case of your work.,1220062,-1,8100
"Team did not explained project well with the description. Diagrams do explain the approach, but for a reader to get the overview but text description is also important. Team can work on adding text description. Same had been suggested in the last review.  ",1219526,1,8100
Just a small explanation of the proposed solution has been given. They could clearly explained more.,1220368,1,8100
"The authors used a lot of charts for use cases, this is great, but they only explained a little for implementation, which could be explained in a great detail.",1219566,1,8100
"The authors have provided use cases for creating new subclass of Questionnaire, SupplementaryReviewQuestionnaire. However, more details can be added to the implementation section such as what new methods will be doing and test plans.",1217178,1,8100
The team has included all the details required to implement the given requirement. The documents lacks the changes the changes that will be made to the system and also the design of the changes. the document just included the list of files that will be changes to achieve the desired result.,1219794,1,8100
The Introduction and Proposed Solution sections appropriately describes the problem and the approach to resolve the issue. The changes proposed can be concisely implemented into the system. They have enlisted use case diagrams for the entire scenario to be added to the rubrics.,1220483,-1,8100
The team only provided the flow diagram to state the logic they will use when they make changes but did not provide any details about what changes they will make and how these changes will be made. The design should be more detailed to explain the changes step by step.,1219260,1,8100
Authors have given a brief description of the subclass of Questionnaire named SupplementaryReviewQuestionnaire that they are going to implement but it would have been better if they have provided how and what model dependency needs to implemented to achieve the goal.,1220294,1,8100
The explanation is adequate. I would suggest that the design of the doc be more explicit. It may include some sub titles and the font shoule be of different sizes to emphasize some parts.,1219626,1,8100
"The design seems good. However, it would be better if the author can mention the design principles and patterns followed in the documentation. ",1220760,1,8100
The desgn looks okay,1220770,-1,8100
Design plan has not changed since I last reviewed. A bit more detail would still be nice,1220063,1,8100
Design doc does not explain the approach to resolve the issue to be taken well. As i could see only 2 lines of explanation. Team should explain the design more clearly for naive users too. Team has not used any design principle.,1219527,1,8100
"Well, not much information has been given on the wiki page. Though they have put some UML flow diagrams which give us an idea of the flow.",1220369,1,8100
"It looks like sound, but I think the authors could add some principles and patterns which they may use into wiki.",1219567,1,8100
The design flow seems simple from the use case diagrams but I cannot review the principles part as it is not adequately explained.,1217179,1,8100
The team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made. the design looks good and easy to implement.,1219795,-1,8100
The design seems to be clear such that it provides the implementation procedure to be followed to include the feature of adding student generated questions to the rubrics.,1220484,-1,8100
"The details are not enough, so it is difficult to tell if the design follows approbate principles. The diagrams covers most of changes they need to make.",1219261,1,8100
Design concept seems promising but a brief introduction about how each module will be implemented for both reviewer and reviewee is missing. ,1220295,1,8100
The design is sound.,1219627,-1,8100
"As per the documentation, the design seems simple.",1220761,-1,8100
Not much explanation given,1220771,1,8100
Looks very doable,1220064,-1,8100
"Yes from the diagrams I could say, design and design flow is simple enough and team has well understood the changes to be made.",1219528,-1,8100
"Yes, the design appears to be very simple",1220370,-1,8100
"Yes, the design is very simple and easy to follow.",1219568,-1,8100
The design seems simple but it is unclear on the implementation section. The authors can add more on how they plan to add new code or modify existing implementations to achieve their goal.,1217180,1,8100
The design appears to be simple and straightforward to implement. The team has also included all the files that will be changed to achieve the desired results,1219796,-1,8100
The design appears simple to be executed based on the procedure specified and the list of diagrams given that it justifies the implementation to be carried out.,1220485,-1,8100
"The diagram is clear and easy to understand, from the diagram, the design may be easy and clear to implement. More details should be provided to evaluate further about the complexity.",1219262,1,8100
"Though not much of design has been giving but as per the functional diagram given, it appears simple implementation ",1220296,1,8100
The design is simple and easy to understand. Could be better if implementing some code level design.,1219628,1,8100
It would be better if UML and Class diagram are added as a part of the documentation. ,1220762,1,8100
Flow charts have been used but no UML or screen shots,1220772,1,8100
Diagrams are still overly large.,1220065,1,8100
"Team has provided good amount of use case diagrams, which actually are heart of the whole design doc and explains the design and approach well.",1219529,-1,8100
They have made some UML diagrams which could describe the changes.,1220371,-1,8100
"Yes, they use a lot of charts to explain the use cases. Great job!",1219569,-1,8100
The use case diagrams are understandable but I think images of web pages will make things more clear.,1217181,1,8100
The team has include the use case diagrams for all the scenarios related to the requirement. Some UI mockups would have helped othwewise great work.,1219797,1,8100
The use case diagrams provided to describe the role of each user through the flow and specify how each case maps to another in order for the desired functionality to be achieved.,1220486,-1,8100
"The diagram is logistic and it's easily to tell the logic behind the changes. By reading these diagrams, I can get an understanding of this project quickly.",1219263,-1,8100
UML and Class diagram are needed.  If the screenshot of the same functionality was given then it would have been better.,1220297,1,8100
"Yes, the flow charts are complete and readable. All cases are included.",1219629,-1,8100
Please add a test plan to the documentation in order to make sure that the test plan is covering the code changes.,1220763,1,8100
Test plan is missing,1220773,1,8100
This section is still blank. ,1220066,1,8100
"No. Team did not mentioned anything under Test Plan.Team should work on this part of project as well, as manual testing will not help to check all the corners of the complex project.",1219530,1,8100
need to include test plan,1220437,1,8100
There is no test plan. The section is left blank.,1220372,1,8100
"There is only a title for test plan, which could be in a great detail.",1219570,1,8100
The test plan section in the doc is left blank. The authors have not stated if the project requires any testing or not.,1217182,1,8100
The team included a test plan section is the documentation which is currently blank. the team should include the automated and manual test scenarios in the document.,1219798,1,8100
The test plan section included in the design document does not provide any content. It could specify the various scenarios considered and describe how each functionality could be tested.,1220487,1,8100
"There is no test plan included in the design document. Actually, there should be a lot of tests need to be done for this project. From the UI, controller to model, the project should include test plan cover all these aspects to make sure the function can work as intended.",1219264,1,8100
"A test plan is there without any details, just the files which will be modified or added are given ",1220298,1,8100
I'm afraid there is still no test plan in the second round.,1219630,1,8100
Yes they have,1220192,-1,8094
explained details about their solution and what will be changed after their implementation.,1220588,-1,8094
"Yes, changes to be made are clearly explained",1219152,-1,8094
"The changes to be made to improve the existing system have been adequately explained in the design document. The filters by which the data needs to be curated have also been stated. However, it would be better if they started by giving a short description of the problem statement and then going into specifics.",1219664,1,8094
They have explained in detail about the proposed changes with individual diagrams for each case. It is very thorough in explanation,1219546,-1,8094
"Great documentation. Tbh, the best i have seen yet.  ",1219026,-1,8094
They have documented it in a very rehearsed manner,1219490,-1,8094
"The design document is really well written. It clearly describes what needs to be done, how it needs to be done and what code changes need to be made. The files and tables affected are clearly listed.",1219866,-1,8094
The authors have prepared the design document quite well.,1219207,-1,8094
The documentation looks great as a high-level design document. Low-level technical details(code level) should also be covered.,1219961,1,8094
The author has explained extensively about the changes to be made to the system.,1217242,-1,8094
"Yes, the problem definition and the proposed solution are pretty clear. They also provide some diagrams to explain their project which is helpful.",1218728,-1,8094
Their introduction and problem definition are clearly enough to explained the changes.,1217411,-1,8094
"With er diagram and database details, the design looks good. ",1220589,-1,8094
The design follows appropriate principles and patterns as required,1219153,-1,8094
"The project consists of making a search function to select specific users, assignments etc using some criteria. So they're creating a search functionality for individual models.",1219665,-1,8094
Yes the proposed changes make only required additions.,1219547,-1,8094
Yes it follows appropriate principles. ,1219027,-1,8094
The design appears to be sound. It is really well structured. It is easy to follow. It clearly states the changes to be made and the files affected by these changes.,1219867,-1,8094
The design appears to be sound and clearly indicates the proposed code changes.,1219208,-1,8094
"Design approaches are clearly explained (yes, the 2nd approach is the correct approach). Any design patterns used???",1219962,1,8094
"The design follows appropriate principles, but no design patterns have been used.",1217243,1,8094
"Yes, the design is appropriate.",1218729,-1,8094
"Yes, they provide solution for different problem situations.",1217412,-1,8094
Yes it is fairly simple,1220194,-1,8094
"no complex design, only few places need to add functionalities, and they all very similar.",1220590,-1,8094
"The design is simple, although the ER diagram takes a little time to decipher since it is quite big",1219154,-1,8094
"Yes, the approach described in the design document is easy enough to understand. They have also backed their decision to go with the second approach with appropriate reasoning.",1219666,-1,8094
The design is simple and quite comprehensive covering lots of methods of searching.,1219548,-1,8094
YEs based on the proposed solution it appears to be simple as possible.,1219028,-1,8094
The design document appears really easy to follow. A person who is new to the project can get the summary of what is happening just by reading and going through the design document.,1219868,-1,8094
The design appears to be simple. However any code modifications is not mentioned yet as work project might not have started so far. it would be nice if a list of files to be modified were added.,1219209,1,8094
"Yes, easy to understand.",1219963,-1,8094
The design has been explained in a simple way. The team has explained the design using use cases which is easy to comprehend.,1217244,-1,8094
"Yes, the design is simple and feasible.",1218730,-1,8094
"Yes, clear and simple.",1217413,-1,8094
They have used apt visual aid like UML diagrams and screen shots,1220195,-1,8094
"No class diagram, but there is er diagram and tables for database, it looks a little complex, but give the idea of what is involving. ",1220591,-1,8094
Necessary diagrams are included.,1219155,-1,8094
The team has communicated their design clearly via use-case diagram and a class diagram with a description of various database tables involved.,1219667,-1,8094
Excellent use of visualizations. They already had an overall flow chart and this time additional tables and UML has been added. Best of what I've seen.,1219549,-1,8094
"Yes they do explain everything. The er diagram, use case diagram, relevant tables explain everything.",1219029,-1,8094
The diagrams seems to go out of the boundary of the pae.,1219493,1,8094
The project has great visualization. A lot of UML diagrams have been included which makes the understanding the project easier. The UML diagrams also clarifies what work is to be done.,1219869,-1,8094
"The pictures clearly demonstrate the changes being made to the system, although it is apparent where the changes would be visible. it would be nice if a image was posted having the current expertiza deployement to show where the changes would be visible",1219210,-1,8094
Not enough! Add use case diagrams and flow diagrams.,1219964,1,8094
The team has described changes using use case and ER diagrams to clearly explain the system.,1217245,-1,8094
The authors add more diagrams to help to explain the change they are going to make. The relevant tables are really helpful.,1218731,-1,8094
"They use ER diagram to describe the changes, but I think it is not very intuitive for me to understand their task.",1217414,1,8094
test plans walk through necessary functionalities.,1220592,-1,8094
"Yes, a good test plan is also included",1219156,-1,8094
The test cases described will cover the functionalities described given that they write multiples tests with the same structure as described for all search criteria. ,1219668,-1,8094
A concrete test plan is also added and it has both UI and automated test details.,1219550,-1,8094
Yes this is done very well.,1219030,-1,8094
"They include a very described test plan. It has everything proper. What framework, what tests all this information is well included. They clearly specify what they aim to test.",1219870,-1,8094
The test plan is pretty good and it has both UI tests and automated tests. ,1219211,-1,8094
Manual test plans as of now! The team is planning to add Rspecs after implementation.,1219965,1,8094
The test plan is designed efficiently. They have described the UI tests and automated tests which cover most of the cases. ,1217246,-1,8094
"Two types of testing are listed, and the authors list all the cases they need to test.",1218732,-1,8094
"They have test plan section, but too few test cases.",1217415,1,8094
Yes they have,1220192,-1,8068
explained details about their solution and what will be changed after their implementation.,1220588,-1,8068
"The changes to be made to improve the existing system have been adequately explained in the design document. The filters by which the data needs to be curated have also been stated. However, it would be better if they started by giving a short description of the problem statement and then going into specifics.",1219664,0,8068
They have explained in detail about the proposed changes with individual diagrams for each case. It is very thorough in explanation,1219546,-1,8068
"Design approaches are clearly explained (yes, the 2nd approach is the correct approach). Any design patterns used???",1219962,1,8068
"The design follows appropriate principles, but no design patterns have been used.",1217243,1,8068
"The design is simple, although the ER diagram takes a little time to decipher since it is quite big",1219154,1,8068
"No class diagram, but there is er diagram and tables for database, it looks a little complex, but give the idea of what is involving. ",1220591,1,8068
The diagrams seems to go out of the boundary of the pae.,1219493,1,8068
"The pictures clearly demonstrate the changes being made to the system, although it is apparent where the changes would be visible. it would be nice if a image was posted having the current expertiza deployement to show where the changes would be visible",1219210,1,8068
Not enough! Add use case diagrams and flow diagrams.,1219964,0,8068
"They use ER diagram to describe the changes, but I think it is not very intuitive for me to understand their task.",1217414,1,8068
The test cases described will cover the functionalities described given that they write multiples tests with the same structure as described for all search criteria. ,1219668,0,8068
"They have test plan section, but too few test cases.",1217415,1,8068
"Yes, changes to be made are explained clearly. Document is very clear, includes necessary diagrams, mock-ups and everything possible to make anyone understand what the issues are and what team is planning to do to resolve them. Everything is included in a proper order like for each issue there is a separate flowchart and mock-up. No suggestions required.",1219861,1,8060
yes the authors have adaquately explained the changes to be made in the system.,1220393,-1,8060
The document is clearly and neatly written. All the necessary sections are present with good explanations.,1220568,-1,8060
Changes are well explained with good visual aids.,1219117,-1,8060
"They have explained every change they want to make to fix the issue. The diagrams, in turn, help a lot to understand the flow of the system.",1219217,-1,8060
Yes the authors have adequately explained all the changes that need to be made. Each issue has a separate list of changes to be made and which files need to be edited.,1220857,-1,8060
The changes are very well documented. For each issue what are the files that needs to be changed is mentioned appropriately. The overall design looks efficient and avoids any duplication. Good Job!,1220127,-1,8060
"Both the problems and proposed changes are clearly detailed. My only suggestion is to put the description of the issue being solved in the same location as the solution to it, otherwise one has to scroll around the page to figure out which problem is being fixed.",1220212,1,8060
"Yes, they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection. They have not only given proper UML diagrams and the like, but they have also implemented the code and showcased in the ""Test Plan"" and the ""Proposed Design"" section. ",1218942,-1,8060
"In round one, Team has well explained their approach and how are they going to do it. In this round, they have included detailed information and mock UI. It was easy to relate their approach. Their test plan is also thorough. I think the team would definitely be able to incorporate the new changes. Good job guys! ",1219352,-1,8060
The design was well explained in this design doc.,1220498,-1,8060
"Well explanation on problem statement. UML diagrams, flow charts given. Detailed explanation on problem statement. ",1220147,-1,8060
yes!,1220583,-1,8060
"Yes, the document seems to be perfect. It does follow all the appropriate principles and patterns. No suggestions required.",1219862,-1,8060
design is fine. some minor errors like no stop phase.Moreover no design patterns used. Just flowcharts are provided.If some sequence diagram or use case diagrams were provided it would improve the design a lot.,1220394,1,8060
"As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.",1220569,-1,8060
The design is apt following the principles and are self-explanatory,1219218,-1,8060
Yes the design appears to be sound and the flow diagrams illustrate the flow of control very well.,1220858,-1,8060
Yes the design is pretty good. The patterns followed avoids any duplication of code. But I had made a suggestion in Review One to take a look at Project 1843 and it's code. The problem statement is quite similar and the code could be reused. I don't see any mention of it. I hope you do take a look before starting to code as it will avoid any re-work.,1220128,1,8060
All good design principles are being followed where necessary.,1220213,-1,8060
The design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the Logical Flow diagram they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the Proposed Design section so as to elucidate the problem statement.,1218943,-1,8060
The design appears to be neat. ,1219353,-1,8060
The design appears to be sound following the appropriate principles and patterns. ,1220499,-1,8060
"Yes, well designed document. UI mock-ups given. It is structured. ",1220148,1,8060
sound. so many diagrams.,1220584,-1,8060
"Yes, it is the simplest design and minimal work which is required to resolve the issues. It is very clearly explained. One can clearly understand the problem statement and the proposed solution for the same. The design document is properly structured as well. ",1219863,-1,8060
design is simple and easy to understand.,1220395,-1,8060
"Yes, simple straightforward solutions.",1220570,-1,8060
The diagrams are very basic and covering the entire scope which is a good work by the team,1219219,-1,8060
Yes the design is robust and simple to understand. Each class and view only handles a specific functionality i.e it is modularised.,1220859,-1,8060
Yes the design is straight forward and easy to understand.,1220129,-1,8060
The design appears to be simple given the task at hand.,1220214,-1,8060
"Yes, the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the staggered deadlines assignment section. ",1218944,-1,8060
"Undoubtedly, I like their color coding approach. It's something very simple and apt for the current system.",1219354,-1,8060
The design seems simple and clear. ,1220500,-1,8060
Design is informative. But too detailed. One UML would have been apt.,1220149,1,8060
very clear,1220585,-1,8060
"Yes, the provided diagrams deliver sufficient information about the implementation. Flowcharts and mock UIs screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required changes. No suggestions required.",1219864,-1,8060
The team has discussed their plan using flowcharts. But they have not used any class diagram.,1219827,1,8060
flowcharts are drawn which describe the flow how the system will work after implementation.,1220396,-1,8060
Great use of mock ups. Really appreciate it.,1220571,-1,8060
"Yes, they have added mock UI screenshots which is exactly what they are going to and should do.",1219220,-1,8060
Yes the diagrams clearly illustrate the proposed flow. Different diagrams are provided for different issues. One of the best wikis I have seen,1220860,-1,8060
Very good use of Class and Sequence diagrams to explain the entire design flow. It clearly conveys the thought  process of authors and the overall design.,1220130,-1,8060
Lots of great visualizations are provided that outline a good amount of detail.,1220215,-1,8060
"Yes, the diagrams are clear to show how the system works. But they, are not so lucid so as to show in the diagram how they are going to implement the changes in the system.   ",1218945,-1,8060
The team has added their mock UI which shows they have thought about the changes and modification. Mock UIs of the screen shows they are halfway the project. ,1219355,-1,8060
"The class diagram is very useful, and the mock UI with indication on it make it more useful. ",1220501,-1,8060
"Yes, design is informative. Change proposal is detailed. It describes well about how changes are to be implemented.",1220150,-1,8060
The diagram is perfect and clear,1220586,-1,8060
"Yes, design does include a well-described test plan. The provided tests will surely test the functionalities which will be implemenedt. The test plan is represented in a wonderful manner including pre-steps and different testing expectations. Great work. No suggestions are required.",1219865,-1,8060
The design includes test plan.On the testb plan provided it seems like they will test the functionalities. But nothing mentioned on how they will write.,1220397,-1,8060
The test plan is comprehensive.,1220572,-1,8060
They have covered all the test plans along with detailed steps.,1219221,-1,8060
"Yes the design includes the test plan. However, the test plan could have been more low level, instead of just writing 'it should' statements.",1220861,1,8060
A through test-plan is described. I do think Test Case-2 could be described more efficiently so that it is clear and easy to understand. Overall looks good.,1220131,1,8060
The test plan is thorough and contains lots of detail that will make it easy to design RSpec tests in the future.,1220216,-1,8060
"The Test Plans are thorough and they gone ahead and shown it in detail by breaking them into steps such as pre-steps, Functional, UI and Performance Testing. This is a very good way to achieve in-depth analysis of the problem and check how effective the solution is.",1218946,-1,8060
"I have to say their test plan includes user interface testing, performance testing, database testing etc. I have to say they have worked really hard for it. I have not yet come across any team who has a test plan like this. ",1219356,-1,8060
An appropriate test plan is included in this design doc. ,1220502,-1,8060
yes the test coverage seems good,1220587,-1,8060
The team have done a good job explaining their project. But I feel the team should have detailed their explanation of the implementation more. Also the test cases should have been included in more detail.,1220227,1,8061
"Overall, the report was concise and fairly clear about what changes were being made to the system. However, the need for the Rails Internationalization API in addition to the Google's Cloud Translation API was not explained. Also, the report mentioned that strings in the actual code were not changing, which should have been explained in more detail.",1220538,0,8061
The authors have explained the required changes in a concise manner.,1219036,-1,8061
"Yes, the project design is meaningful and clear. The solution is well laid out.",1220789,-1,8061
Changes are explained but are not very descriptive. The document is not much changed since the last submission,1219779,1,8061
The authors have not explained properly the modifications that needs to be made. They have just written the objective.,1220077,1,8061
Yes. ,1220623,-1,8061
"Yes, the authors have specified the changes to be made in the system under the proposed project design. The changes have been included as sub heading with sub points under each. The authors have also included a relevant files heading that includes the files where changes are made.The changes involve allowing the instructor to change language for a course. In the process a separate language column will be added to the Courses table and a dropdown of languages in the Edit Courses page where a language can be chosen. Once the instructor updates the Edit Course page with the chosen language, the static strings in the Expertiza application will be changed to the chosen language. For adding multi-language support, Google Translate and Rails Internationalization API is being used. Also, two yaml files- en.yml and hi_EN.yml contains the translated strings for the respective languages. The routes.rb file and all the view files will be correspondingly modified to show the different languages after reading from the yaml files. ",1220117,-1,8061
The explanations provided by the authors seems to be good. They have referred the Rails Internationalization API guide which provides sufficient explanation for multi language support. They have mentioned the different elements that will be changed and how an instructor would proceed to change the language of the course verbally. In addition they have also added mock-ups to visually represent this information.,1218896,-1,8061
The explainations are succinct. The description in technical design section and before-after images clearly shows what the project intends to do.,1217183,-1,8061
"The changes are clearly mentioned , they are very clear what and where to make changes. Only suggestion would be to include more about how these changes are going to be done. ",1219754,-1,8061
"Yes authors have done well to explain the changes being done in the project. I think I wish they would have added is the details of languages they are supporting.   Also they do mention that they will add extra column to languages table, they could have pasted the new schema in the doc",1220197,1,8061
Yes the design appears to be sound following the appropriate principles and patterns. Fell the team could have explained in more detail.,1220228,1,8061
Adding a languages column to the Courses table makes sense and so does leveraging third-party APIs to handle the translation.,1220539,-1,8061
"The design is as required, following the appropriate patterns.",1219037,-1,8061
"As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.",1220790,-1,8061
No design found on the wiki. Not sure if any design diagram is needed but a flow diagram to test the changes can be helpful.,1219780,1,8061
The authors have not mentioned any design pattern that they will be using. They have mentioned the files that need to be modified.,1220078,1,8061
It is sound. ,1220624,-1,8061
The design appears to be clear. The inclusion of a visual aid that shows how the control transfers from the view to controller to model and back to controller and view whenever the language is changed could have been shown to help readers better understand the design.  ,1220118,1,8061
Looking at the design there seems to be high use of cohesion  and low coupling. It's good that all the changes are restricted to the routes.rb and config/locales files so that the resulting changes won't be messy and ruin the rest of the system. Also this helps in refactoring if needed in the future as there will be limited number of files to be changed.,1218897,-1,8061
"The design is quite good. It clearly explains what needs to be done and where the changes will be made. However, the only suggestion would be to include more UML diagrams so that the design becomes more clear and understandable.",1219755,1,8061
Design looks good at high level though specific details about implementation are still missing. I would expect that here.  they also state that they are using google translate details on what api they will be using would have been helpful,1220198,1,8061
"Yes, the design appears to be as simple as possible. The team has mentioned what needs to be done and how they plan to implement it.",1220229,-1,8061
The need for two translation APIs was not justified.,1220540,1,8061
The changes have been explained well enough to minimize the complexity. The implementation seems extremely clear.,1219038,-1,8061
"Yes, simple straightforward solution.  ",1220791,-1,8061
As mentioned no design diagrams are present.,1219781,1,8061
Yes. Only view files are involving since this topic is about changing the language. ,1220625,-1,8061
"The design is simple- the authors have discussed the changes like allowing instructor to change language of a course and adding multi-language support in the design. One suggestion is that the authors could have described the difference between static and dynamic strings used in this context. Especially since they specify that only static strings will be translated, but dynamic strings will remain in English.",1220119,1,8061
The design appears to be very simple. The team has avoided unnecessary complications by adhereing to the Rails Internationalization guide. They have also avoided making unnecessary changes to many files and kept the changes to the minimum number of files required.,1218898,-1,8061
The authors have explained well regarding their design approach to support Hindi language but it has not mentioned if their design is flexible enough to add another languages in the future. I think they can mention if their design can accomodate other languages easily or not.,1217185,1,8061
The design is really crisp and easy to understand. One can clearly understand the problem statement and the proposed solution for the same. The design document is properly structured as well.,1219756,-1,8061
Yes the current design looks simple and wholesome. Seems they have done a good job in implementing understanding how rails internationalization works. Good job   ,1220199,-1,8061
The team have an image of what they plan to implement. The team however have-not used any helpful visualizations like UML diagrams that would aid in the understanding.,1220230,1,8061
The visualization clearly and effectively conveys the translation capability which the project proposes to provide to Expertiza.,1220541,-1,8061
"Yes, the provided diagrams deliver sufficient information about the implementation.",1219039,-1,8061
The necessary visual inputs to aid explanation are present.,1220792,-1,8061
mock UIs screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required changes.,1219782,-1,8061
No visualization or diagrams are necessary.,1220080,1,8061
Maybe add some design diagrams rather than just have screenshots. ,1220626,1,8061
"The authors have shown screenshots of example output as a part of visualization. This shows the original page, the updated page with the facility to change language and the translated page to Hindi. Though this visualization displays the final output, there is no visualization that shows the design and implementation of this new feature. ",1220120,1,8061
There were mock-ups of the final result of the project however there were no UML diagrams. I think the UML diagrams are not necessary for this project since the flow of how the instructor will change the language is fairly simple and one can understand it by just reading the document. Maybe they could have done a mock-up of how some of the other views would have looked like once the language has changed. Especially the pages with flash messages if any. Currently they have just shown the proposed changes on the page where the instructor will change the language.,1218899,-1,8061
The images of web pages clearly describe the changes to be made to the system however there are no class diagrams or use cases diagrams.,1217186,1,8061
"Though this project doesn't require any UML diagram as such. However, a flowchart showing the work flow would have made the design document better and efficient.",1219757,1,8061
"The screenshots for the view are great, they help in understanding the problem statement and the solution. however the design document lacks use case or class diagrams on how extenral entity interacts with the system and gets response.  Since the authors are using external api's it would have been good if they could give more details request and response ",1220200,1,8061
The team have written a test plan. But I feel more test cases could have been written to test the edge cases. Also the team could have explained their test cases in more detail.,1220231,-1,8061
"The test plan is clear and effective but shallow. Manual testing is good, but more description should be provided for the automated testing.",1220542,1,8061
"A testplan that covers the entire functionality has been devised, it seems sufficient to test the change.",1219040,-1,8061
The test plan is compatible with the problem statement. ,1220793,-1,8061
As there are UI changes test plan is not required but a basic stepwise description of how to see the required output can be helpful,1219783,1,8061
Test plan have been shown clearly and tests are easy to understand.,1220081,-1,8061
"Yup, because it only tests the ability to change the language. ",1220627,-1,8061
The design includes a brief test plan that lists three scenarios namely- the regular steps to update Course page to Hindi; checking if Edit Assignment page has also been translated and checking if other pages are translated. Some more test cases like checking if the change in language is reflected from a student login could have been included. The authors specify that Rspec and Capybara is used for testing the new feature.,1220121,1,8061
The test plan seems to be fine. It basically outlines all the functionalities that the team will test. The different cases the team will test is also outlined though not many. I guess there will be more test cases to be added once the project is on the roll.,1218900,1,8061
The test plan briefly mentions the scenarios the team plans to test. They can add more about the test cases if possible.,1217187,1,8061
"The document does include a test plan section . However, it just includes what framework they plan to use for testing. No solid test planning was described in the test plan section.",1219758,1,8061
"I feel that the test section is in adequate, the users have only listed 3 scenarios with no details on how to implement that. Also missing are detailed steps on how to execute the tests if required.",1220201,1,8061
The team explained everything required and not leave anything behind. ,1220528,-1,8109
The authors haven;t given the files to be modified or the changes they are going to do to the system.,1219896,1,8109
The design doc explains the project in detail. I would suggest that the description could be modified by removing redundancy to make the doc more succinct. Also what MVC files are being touched could have been mentioned.,1219177,1,8109
"Yes, they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection. They have not only given proper UML diagrams and the like, but they have also implemented the code and showcased in the ""Implementation"" section. ",1218852,-1,8109
The wiki page is very explanatory and the authors have explained the issue and fix very well,1219789,-1,8109
Yes the required changes for the reviews is explained clearly. The design for each required change is also explained in depth now.,1220408,-1,8109
The authors have clearly mentioned the changes to be made using Problem Statement and Use Case Diagram.,1220072,-1,8109
No. Not clear,1219606,1,8109
Yes the author has made a great attempt to explain the changes by trying to explain the changes required with the help of the application flow diagram and the use case diagram and how the changes were implemented by giving screenshots of the changes.,1220518,-1,8109
"Yes, the changes to be made are nicely explain. The diagrams and screenshots are in place. Suggestion: There was more scope to the test plans",1219951,1,8109
"It seems to me that the implementation of the project has not started yet. Hence, the exact place in the Expertiza code where they plan to make changes is missing. This should be added in my opinion. Additionally, they have explained very well as to what changes need to be done and how they will be done. So, good job there.",1219400,1,8109
The documentation done by the team is very detailed and explains the problem statement very clearly. They have described the functionality change in bullet points which makes it very easy to understand the sub parts required to achieve the main functionality in simple terms. ,1220882,-1,8109
I like the part where the peer review has been given more weightage in comparison to self review in the composite score.,1219897,-1,8109
Yes the team seem to have a clear idea as to what must be done and how the result must look. It would be helpful if the team gave some insights as to how the composite score formula was decided as this is the heart of the project.,1219178,1,8109
The design appears to followed appropriate principles and patterns. ,1220529,-1,8109
There is no mention for the design strategy or design pattern to be used in the implementation.,1220073,1,8109
"The overall design looks good. The score calculation formula still looks a bit weird. Using the current formula, it is possible to have a higher  composite score than each of the individual scores , which should not be the case. ",1220409,1,8109
"The design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the use case diagram in which the users are student and instructor and the data base is where the actions are stored in the database and the retrieved from the same for the case of reviews information.  Also, they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the Application Flow section so as to elucidate the problem statement.",1218853,-1,8109
Yes,1219607,-1,8109
Yes the design is very simple and explains the changes required in a very clear manner,1220519,-1,8109
The flow and UML diagrams are well designed and explain a lot about the system flow. addition of detailed use case helps support the diagram,1219790,-1,8109
The design seems to be following the appropriate principles and uses the appropriate guidelines. They usecase diagram mentions each actor and the role associated.,1219401,-1,8109
"The design does appear to be sound. The team has put most of the use cases, actors and explained them well. The screenshots of the UI are also present. Suggestion: Could have explained the implementation a bit more in bullet points.",1219952,1,8109
"The team has very well explained the changes they are making in the project to achieve the functionality. However, they have not included any design explanation explicitly. They have not described the approach they have come with. It might be helpful if they could add the design approach as well in the wiki link so that its easier to understand the code changes by having a glance at the design pattern.",1220883,1,8109
The design is as simple as possible. ,1220530,-1,8109
"Yes, the design looks simple , no complications and the screenshots are really helpful.",1219179,-1,8109
Yes the design is simple and easy to understand for others too. The explanation along with diagrams provides enough information to understand the use-case.,1220410,-1,8109
"Yes, the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the review section. ",1218854,-1,8109
The design is simple and very much in depth. and follows the principle,1219791,-1,8109
es the design is very simple and explains the changes required in a very clear manner,1220520,-1,8109
Complex design,1219608,1,8109
"The design looks good. But from the implementation details given and the amount of use cases listed, I feel there could be some more implementation details that are left out.",1219953,1,8109
"Yes, the design appears to be as simple as possible. The team has mentioned what needs to be done and how they plan to implement it. Hence, it is easy to understand.",1219402,-1,8109
"As stated above, the team has not explained any design pattern they are following. However they have mentioned all the code changes they are making for this functionality implementation. The code snippets they have included is very useful to understand the exact code changes they are making and the files which are getting impacted. This would help the future developers to understand the  code in a simple manner.",1220884,1,8109
"Application flow, use case diagram are both very useful to describe the changes, ",1220531,-1,8109
Yes the visuals provided with this doc are clear and just by that a lot can be understood.,1219180,-1,8109
"Yes, the diagrams are clear to show how the system works. But they, are not so lucid so as to show in the diagram how they are going to implement the changes in the system. ",1218855,1,8109
The use case diagram and application flow diagram very well explains the changes made to the system.,1220075,-1,8109
The chart and diagrams are well done and help explain how the code will work.,1219345,-1,8109
Basic UML used,1219609,-1,8109
yes the application flow diagram tells of how the functionality will be accessed both by user and student and the use case diagram explains the interaction of the instructor and the students for the particular functionalities ,1220521,1,8109
Some UI screenshots are added along with design diagrams which describe the system. The UI or mock UI helps in better understanding,1219792,-1,8109
The explanation and the diagrams don't match exactly. The explanation says user should be able to see composite and peer review scores only after he completes his own review. That is not captured in the flow diagram. Else it is self explanatory,1220411,1,8109
"The visualizations seem to be complete. The team has included an application flow diagram, a use case diagram and also a screenshot of how the actual result should look. So, in my opinion, good job done!",1219403,-1,8109
The UML diagrams are detailed and explained well. Suggestion: The application flow could be explained in points so that the reviewer has a clearer view of what is the sequence of events occurring.,1219954,-1,8109
The team has done tremendous job in adding visualization aids. They have added application flow diagrams for every actor along with the UML diagram of the student and instructor. They have also included screenshots to explain the code functionality implementation of enabling self reviews and score pages. This makes the document descriptive and very easy to read and understand.  ,1220885,-1,8109
A test plan is included in this design doc. ,1220532,-1,8109
"No, not really, the design is does not implement the test plan but rather goes on to show how the pre existing Expertiza algorithm works. So it would help if they showed the same. ",1218856,1,8109
The current tests written are good but it would be good if the team had pointed out the corner cases as wel such as - what happens if the deadline for self-review is exceeded? Does that mean the peer-review scores cannot be seen? Or is a default score of 0 is set?,1219181,1,8109
The test plan added is just a basic case and as the changes are just some calculations to be made test plan is not much of a requirement for the project.,1219793,1,8109
Test plan is very shallow. Only the headings are mentioned. A proper description of what is the test for and what to expect from each test will be helpful in understanding.,1220412,1,8109
There is no proper test plan. The authors have just mentioned the required tests that needs to be done. No proper explanation has been given about how these tests will be implemented.,1220076,1,8109
No tests,1219610,1,8109
Yes the test plan is included but the test plan appears to be very shallow as it gives the which functionalities must be test but doesn't mentions it inform of test like what should be the actions taken when a certain condition arises it can be more clearly stated by mentioning the test cases in form of context and it statements,1220522,1,8109
The design has been listed with a few test plans. I feel that there could be more tests included. Suggestion: Test plans need to be explained more and could provide the code if TDD approach is used.,1219955,1,8109
The team has an outline of the test plan and the test scenarios which they are planning to take care of. It would be suggested that the team takes care of all the exhaustive scenarios which are related to the functionality. They could also add the step wise description of the scenarios they have mentioned or the test cases they are planning to implement. Test driven approach makes sure our code is exhaustive of all scenarios.,1220886,1,8109
The test plan can be more elaborate and complete. This will help as part of the behaviour driven design process and also help you test whether every change made works correctly.,1219404,1,8109
"After the first review, the design has improved significantly. The proposed design clearly defines the changes being made by the team.",1220814,-1,8032
Not enough explanation,1219289,-1,8032
"Yes, the proposed solutions part clearly stated that they will go through each review to compare the new review score, etc, and then they will store the review URL. However, the solution is not concrete enough and is a little bit hard to follow. It should be great if there's more details in stating about how to loop through each reviews.  ",1220157,1,8032
"They have a paragraph saying what they are going to do, but it could be broken up into parts with images for better understanding",1218891,1,8032
"The authors have explained well what changes they wish to make and how they plan to implement those changes. I would suggest them to add more details like, ""where do they store the list of responses more than the notification threshold"". Overall good job.",1219871,1,8032
A format of the proposed email to be sent would be helpful,1219311,-1,8032
"No, their didn't include enough text explanation.",1220668,1,8032
"Yes, they include this part in the Proposed Solutions field. It would be better if they use visualization to let the readers better understand the flow.",1220217,1,8032
Not well structured and less content,1219500,1,8032
I know exactly what this team is doing.,1219586,-1,8032
"The design document contains all the necessary sections but fails to provide adequate explanation of the changes to be made. The authors have done a good job at explaining the current scenario, also identified the code where the changes are to be made. They have identified the need of a new function and its purpose, but fail to provide a design of the intended changes, i.e. new functions or modifications in the functions, any need to use different variables etc. The authors have not added any changes relevant to the previous suggestions.",1219621,1,8032
"Yes, the problem statement and the proposed changes have been clearly explained.",1220274,-1,8032
The design has improved and updates has been done and it is easy to comprehend the changes to be made to the system.,1220344,-1,8032
There has been a significant improvement in the level of details provided. The author can further improve the document by providing the details of the design pattern to be used.,1220815,1,8032
Design is okay,1219290,-1,8032
"The design is sound because it follows the problem statement and the instructions. I doubt if it follows the DRY principle while looping through each review, because that might be already done in the Expertiza. In terms of patterns, I think here it needs to use the factory pattern, altough it's not stated in the design.",1220158,1,8032
"Design does seem to be sound, but complex. As mentioned in the earlier review, I am unsure if looping over each review is the correct thing to do or not. Maybe the team discussed this with the mentor and decided against it as no new information has been added in the document. If so, I would only suggest the team to include the complexity of the design in the document.",1219872,1,8032
"Yes, but they didnt show their principles and pattern very well.",1220669,1,8032
"The design seems workable. Maybe they can come up a more sound design. For example, they can try many ways to define the notification limit.",1220218,1,8032
"By looking at the flow-charts and UML diagrams submitted by the team, their solution appears to be sound.",1219471,-1,8032
It seems as though this team's approach was well designed.,1219587,-1,8032
"As they have provided a very high-level idea of their proposed solution, there is no pseudocode or any class diagram which helps explain the design adequately. You can improvise the design by including flow of the methods, to highlight how and where will your new method come into picture. However, looking at the intended modifications, it seems that the changes follow DRY principles, and changes are not unnecessary. There is also no need of using any design patterns as per the required changes.",1219622,1,8032
Author could have provided the design pattern they need to implement.,1220345,1,8032
The design seems to be pretty straightforward.,1220816,-1,8032
Very basic design,1219291,1,8032
"The design is simple, although it could be better if it has more concrete examples.",1220159,1,8032
"Yes, the design is as simple as it can get. Understanding the principle is not hard. But making it simple should also not make it costly. Good work to the team if the instructors were looking for something this simple :)",1219873,1,8032
"Yes, it simple but some parts are not easy to understand.",1220670,1,8032
The design is simple and really better than before.,1220219,1,8032
The team has provided diagrams that make it easier for the reader to understand the workflow of the system and the changes that they have proposed to implement the solution.,1219472,-1,8032
"The way the team plans to loop through each review to calculate a review score seems slightly more complex than necessary, but I agree with them taking this apporach as it will allow them to break down the reason why the scores are different.",1219588,1,8032
"The design does appear to be simple, as they have not planned to modify any of the existing methods. Their new method will interact with Response, AssignmentQuestionnaire model, and then link the assignment to the review in the email. However, they have not mentioned if they have planned any data structure/variable to store the assignment link and pass it on to the method where email notification will be sent. But, i suppose that storing it in a variable will suffice. ",1219623,1,8032
"The design and application flow appear to be as simple as possible, as well as the proposed code changes snippet provided.",1220276,-1,8032
The design seems simple.,1220346,-1,8032
The author uses the UML diagram to properly describe the system. ,1220817,-1,8032
No visualization,1219292,1,8032
"There are a lot of diagrams, but the application flow and the UML Diagram doesn't look very clear. We can hardly see the words in the UML Diagram. Also, the diagrams seem to not fit each other. How does the application diagram and the Uml diagram connect to each other? There's no clear instructions. Also, I don't think a screen shot of code in the design doc is a good idea. I think it could be better if the changes expected to be made can be described in a more abstract fashion. ",1220160,1,8032
"The UML diagrams given in the document list the process flow for testing/understanding the changes which will be made in the document. But, unfortunately, no diagram exists which describe the changes to be made.   I would suggest the team to add diagrams for the pseudo-code they may have written.",1219874,1,8032
"Yes, the use of visualization is great.",1220671,-1,8032
"They used the UML diagrams, it really help me a lot when reading the wiki page. Maybe they can also make diagrams about the changes they are going to make.",1220220,-1,8032
"As mentioned, the team has provided UML diagrams stating the two actors in their system- Student, Instructor and their interaction with the email module and database.",1219473,-1,8032
"The visualization aids used currently are application flow diagram, and use cases. They are useful to understand the scenario of the problem statement. However, a sequence or a communication diagram will really be beneficial to understand how the method interfaces with the other  methods. This will help identify if the new method impacts other functionalities and will portray the proposed solution efficiently.",1219624,-1,8032
Proper diagrams are used by the team. ,1220347,-1,8032
"There are UML and application flow diagrams included with the design document, which serve to make the proposed design changes much clearer.",1220277,-1,8032
The team have done a good job explaining their project. But I feel the team should have detailed their explanation of the implementation more. Also the test cases should have been included in more detail.,1220227,1,8038
"Overall, the report was concise and fairly clear about what changes were being made to the system. However, the need for the Rails Internationalization API in addition to the Google's Cloud Translation API was not explained. Also, the report mentioned that strings in the actual code were not changing, which should have been explained in more detail.",1220538,1,8038
No test plan,1219293,1,8032
The authors have explained the required changes in a concise manner.,1219036,-1,8038
"Yes, the project design is meaningful and clear. The solution is well laid out.",1220789,-1,8038
Changes are explained but are not very descriptive. The document is not much changed since the last submission,1219779,1,8038
"There's a testing plan. Although the testing plan seems to cover the fuctionalities, it is not clearly stated. The tester should log in as what role? how to select a teams assignment and review it? How to log out and check the instructor's email? which instructor email should the tester check? These questions should have been answered in the test plan.",1220161,1,8032
The authors have not explained properly the modifications that needs to be made. They have just written the objective.,1220077,1,8038
They have one scenario. maybe a few more could help better test their work,1218895,1,8032
Yes. ,1220623,-1,8038
"Yes, the authors have specified the changes to be made in the system under the proposed project design. The changes have been included as sub heading with sub points under each. The authors have also included a relevant files heading that includes the files where changes are made.The changes involve allowing the instructor to change language for a course. In the process a separate language column will be added to the Courses table and a dropdown of languages in the Edit Courses page where a language can be chosen. Once the instructor updates the Edit Course page with the chosen language, the static strings in the Expertiza application will be changed to the chosen language. For adding multi-language support, Google Translate and Rails Internationalization API is being used. Also, two yaml files- en.yml and hi_EN.yml contains the translated strings for the respective languages. The routes.rb file and all the view files will be correspondingly modified to show the different languages after reading from the yaml files. ",1220117,-1,8038
The explanations provided by the authors seems to be good. They have referred the Rails Internationalization API guide which provides sufficient explanation for multi language support. They have mentioned the different elements that will be changed and how an instructor would proceed to change the language of the course verbally. In addition they have also added mock-ups to visually represent this information.,1218896,-1,8038
The explainations are succinct. The description in technical design section and before-after images clearly shows what the project intends to do.,1217183,-1,8038
"The changes are clearly mentioned , they are very clear what and where to make changes. Only suggestion would be to include more about how these changes are going to be done. ",1219754,1,8038
"Yes authors have done well to explain the changes being done in the project. I think I wish they would have added is the details of languages they are supporting.   Also they do mention that they will add extra column to languages table, they could have pasted the new schema in the doc",1220197,1,8038
Yes the design appears to be sound following the appropriate principles and patterns. Fell the team could have explained in more detail.,1220228,1,8038
Adding a languages column to the Courses table makes sense and so does leveraging third-party APIs to handle the translation.,1220539,-1,8038
"The design is as required, following the appropriate patterns.",1219037,-1,8038
"As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.",1220790,-1,8038
No design found on the wiki. Not sure if any design diagram is needed but a flow diagram to test the changes can be helpful.,1219780,1,8038
The authors have not mentioned any design pattern that they will be using. They have mentioned the files that need to be modified.,1220078,1,8038
It is sound. ,1220624,-1,8038
"The test plan section unfortunately lists no concrete test that the team would write. Checking the functionality manually, and writing rspec tests for the code written are extremely different, and I would suggest the team to have a dedicated test plan section, mentioning the controller/model they wish to test, the objects they would need to mock etc.",1219875,1,8032
The design appears to be clear. The inclusion of a visual aid that shows how the control transfers from the view to controller to model and back to controller and view whenever the language is changed could have been shown to help readers better understand the design.  ,1220118,1,8038
some additional tests can be added,1219315,-1,8032
Looking at the design there seems to be high use of cohesion  and low coupling. It's good that all the changes are restricted to the routes.rb and config/locales files so that the resulting changes won't be messy and ruin the rest of the system. Also this helps in refactoring if needed in the future as there will be limited number of files to be changed.,1218897,-1,8038
"Yes, the doc contains test plan, but they are not specific.",1220672,1,8032
"The design is quite good. It clearly explains what needs to be done and where the changes will be made. However, the only suggestion would be to include more UML diagrams so that the design becomes more clear and understandable.",1219755,1,8038
Design looks good at high level though specific details about implementation are still missing. I would expect that here.  they also state that they are using google translate details on what api they will be using would have been helpful,1220198,1,8038
"Yes, the design appears to be as simple as possible. The team has mentioned what needs to be done and how they plan to implement it.",1220229,-1,8038
The need for two translation APIs was not justified.,1220540,1,8038
The changes have been explained well enough to minimize the complexity. The implementation seems extremely clear.,1219038,-1,8038
"Yes, simple straightforward solution.  ",1220791,-1,8038
As mentioned no design diagrams are present.,1219781,1,8038
Simple and easy to understand steps.,1220079,-1,8038
Yes. Only view files are involving since this topic is about changing the language. ,1220625,-1,8038
The document does contain a test plan which can definitely be extended to incorporate certain negative test cases.,1220818,-1,8032
"The design is simple- the authors have discussed the changes like allowing instructor to change language of a course and adding multi-language support in the design. One suggestion is that the authors could have described the difference between static and dynamic strings used in this context. Especially since they specify that only static strings will be translated, but dynamic strings will remain in English.",1220119,1,8038
The design appears to be very simple. The team has avoided unnecessary complications by adhereing to the Rails Internationalization guide. They have also avoided making unnecessary changes to many files and kept the changes to the minimum number of files required.,1218898,-1,8038
They did include a test plan. It would be better if they also test the instructor side.,1220221,-1,8032
The authors have explained well regarding their design approach to support Hindi language but it has not mentioned if their design is flexible enough to add another languages in the future. I think they can mention if their design can accomodate other languages easily or not.,1217185,1,8038
The design is really crisp and easy to understand. One can clearly understand the problem statement and the proposed solution for the same. The design document is properly structured as well.,1219756,-1,8038
Yes the current design looks simple and wholesome. Seems they have done a good job in implementing understanding how rails internationalization works. Good job   ,1220199,-1,8038
No visualization or diagrams are necessary.,1220080,-1,8038
The team have an image of what they plan to implement. The team however have-not used any helpful visualizations like UML diagrams that would aid in the understanding.,1220230,1,8038
The visualization clearly and effectively conveys the translation capability which the project proposes to provide to Expertiza.,1220541,-1,8038
"Yes, the provided diagrams deliver sufficient information about the implementation.",1219039,-1,8038
The necessary visual inputs to aid explanation are present.,1220792,-1,8038
mock UIs screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required changes.,1219782,-1,8038
The test plan seems overly simplistic. It only tests whether the team's changes work in the most drastic scenario possible. It seems like they should have more boundary value tests and more test cases to account for their new method of looping through the reviews to compare new reviews with previous ones.,1219590,1,8032
Maybe add some design diagrams rather than just have screenshots. ,1220626,1,8038
"I think that there is a huge scope for test plan improvisation. The current test plan is just a step-by-step procedure to test if the reviewer receives a mail fir conflicting reviews. The test plan should also include test cases to test whether the link is present in the email notification. Also, is the link correct and navigable? The test plan should also cover the pits where the functionality may fail, so as to ensure smooth functioning of the system.",1219625,1,8032
"The authors have shown screenshots of example output as a part of visualization. This shows the original page, the updated page with the facility to change language and the translated page to Hindi. Though this visualization displays the final output, there is no visualization that shows the design and implementation of this new feature. ",1220120,1,8038
There were mock-ups of the final result of the project however there were no UML diagrams. I think the UML diagrams are not necessary for this project since the flow of how the instructor will change the language is fairly simple and one can understand it by just reading the document. Maybe they could have done a mock-up of how some of the other views would have looked like once the language has changed. Especially the pages with flash messages if any. Currently they have just shown the proposed changes on the page where the instructor will change the language.,1218899,1,8038
Test plan is as simple as required for the problem statement in question.,1220278,-1,8032
Design doc includes the test plan but more detail on negative test cases would have been better.,1220348,-1,8032
The team has provided a code snippet which includes solution to their problem statement. They have described the code and their proposed changes,1219470,-1,8032
The images of web pages clearly describe the changes to be made to the system however there are no class diagrams or use cases diagrams.,1217186,1,8038
"Though this project doesn't require any UML diagram as such. However, a flowchart showing the work flow would have made the design document better and efficient.",1219757,1,8038
"The screenshots for the view are great, they help in understanding the problem statement and the solution. however the design document lacks use case or class diagrams on how extenral entity interacts with the system and gets response.  Since the authors are using external api's it would have been good if they could give more details request and response ",1220200,1,8038
The team have written a test plan. But I feel more test cases could have been written to test the edge cases. Also the team could have explained their test cases in more detail.,1220231,1,8038
"The test plan is clear and effective but shallow. Manual testing is good, but more description should be provided for the automated testing.",1220542,1,8038
"A testplan that covers the entire functionality has been devised, it seems sufficient to test the change.",1219040,-1,8038
The test plan is compatible with the problem statement. ,1220793,-1,8038
As there are UI changes test plan is not required but a basic stepwise description of how to see the required output can be helpful,1219783,1,8038
Test plan have been shown clearly and tests are easy to understand.,1220081,-1,8038
"Yup, because it only tests the ability to change the language. ",1220627,-1,8038
The design includes a brief test plan that lists three scenarios namely- the regular steps to update Course page to Hindi; checking if Edit Assignment page has also been translated and checking if other pages are translated. Some more test cases like checking if the change in language is reflected from a student login could have been included. The authors specify that Rspec and Capybara is used for testing the new feature.,1220121,-1,8038
The test plan seems to be fine. It basically outlines all the functionalities that the team will test. The different cases the team will test is also outlined though not many. I guess there will be more test cases to be added once the project is on the roll.,1218900,1,8038
The test plan briefly mentions the scenarios the team plans to test. They can add more about the test cases if possible.,1217187,1,8038
"The document does include a test plan section . However, it just includes what framework they plan to use for testing. No solid test planning was described in the test plan section.",1219758,1,8038
"I feel that the test section is in adequate, the users have only listed 3 scenarios with no details on how to implement that. Also missing are detailed steps on how to execute the tests if required.",1220201,1,8038
"The issues have been identified and documented clearly. However, a little more of explanation is required for the solutions proposed for issues 2 - 5. They seem to me at a very high level.",1220643,1,8108
"As far as the issues are concerned, the solutions do seem logical.   ",1220644,-1,8108
"Yes, simple straightforward solutions.",1220645,-1,8108
Great use of mock ups and UML diagrams. It makes understanding the issues easier. Looks like a great amount of thought has gone into making it. ,1220646,-1,8108
"Testing plan is not included. However, somewhat of an idea can be obtained from the steps to reproduce.",1220647,1,8108
"Yes, the authors have nicely explained the changes to be made. This includes, the flow diagrams, UML diagrams and many of the screenshots. Good work team. Suggestion: Could include screenshots, if any, of the test plans implemented.",1219906,-1,8108
The design looks good. All the issues are stated and addressed nicely.,1219907,-1,8108
The design does not seem that complex. The team has clearly mentioned the issues and the way to go about it.  ,1219908,-1,8108
The visualization is great. All the flow diagrams and required screenshots are in place as required.,1219909,-1,8108
There are some test plans in place and others will be done after the bugs are generated. Suggestions: It would have been great to have screenshots of the test plans.,1219910,1,8108
"Yes, they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection. They have not only given proper UML diagrams and the like, but they are yet to implement the code and showcase in the ""UML Diagram for Review"" section.     ",1218857,-1,8108
"  The design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the use case diagram in which the users are student and instructor and the data base is where the actions are stored in the database and the retrieved from the same for the case of reviews information.  Also, they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the Application Flow section so as to elucidate the problem statement. ",1218858,-1,8108
"Yes, the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the review section. ",1218859,-1,8108
"Yes, the diagrams are clear to show how the system works. They have even gone a step ahead to show how they have thought of resolving the problem at each and every step of the Expertiza review section and the message popups they receive for the same. ",1218860,-1,8108

"The team has included all the details required to implement the given requirement. The wiki has complete details related to requirements , analysis of current designs and changes required to achieve the required functionality. overall great job !  The team did a great work in analyzing the issues and designing solutions for the issues. The UI mock ups are included for all the issues which makes the document very easy to understand.  ",1219784,-1,8108
The team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made. the design looks good and easy to implement. great work done !  ,1219785,-1,8108
The design appears to be simple and straightforward to implement. The team has also included all the changes that will be made to achieve the desired results.  Great Work !,1219786,-1,8108
The team has included a lot of visual aids which complements the document making it a lot easier to understand.  Great work with the UI mockups / project design / UML diagrams.,1219787,-1,8108
"The team has included the test plan design but the documentation is missing on the scenarios that will be tested after the implementation, How the team will be testing it , what are the automated test that will be created and also the manual test plan. How an end user can test the end-to- end requirements should also be a part of the design.",1219788,1,8108
Very well written document. Good job team.,1220324,-1,8108
Clearly explained with diagrams and UML diagrams.,1220325,-1,8108
The design is simple. ,1220326,-1,8108
Great work by the team on UML diagrams. ,1220327,-1,8108
"As per the requirement document, test cases are not required.",1220328,-1,8108
Team have explained the Problem/Steps to Reproduce are really very clear. Solution part could have been explained better. Overall its a good work,1219991,-1,8108
The doc is very well written. Its like a blueprint to the project. Really appreciate the team efforts!,1219212,-1,8108
"Since the project is aimed at fixing the issues, no design patterns need to be used.",1219213,-1,8108
The explanation of each of the issues in details is done very well but it does seem to be complicated unless files to be modified and solutions are read.,1219214,1,8108
The visuals used are excellent but it would have been nice to not overwhelm the reader.,1219215,1,8108
"The problems are described very nicely. When it comes to changes to be made, files to be modified are given. I feel more explanation needs to be given with respect to changes in these files for each problem stating why this file needs to be changed and what the impact will be.",1219886,1,8108
Tests are given at a very high level and need to be described properly.,1219890,1,8108
"Yes, they look well written and easy to follow with all the visual aids. ",1220628,-1,8108
the design is sound with appropriate principles and patterns. ,1220629,-1,8108
"yes, only a few files are being modified. ",1220630,-1,8108
"A lots of visuals, very helpful when viewers walk through the design. ",1220631,-1,8108
"Make include more details for test plan, other than that, the wiki looks very good. ",1220632,1,8108
Drastic improvements have been made to design doc. ,1218768,-1,8108
Mostly yes. But the working flow could have been explained better with the flow diagrams.,1218769,1,8108
The design document is easy to comprehend.Have explained in detail about the problem but not about the solution.,1218770,1,8108
Given UML diagram which are explaining the functionality appropriately but class diagram would have been better to explain the detail code level change ,1218771,1,8108
Test plans are present but have not explained in detail. A brief description  of the use case with the test plan and RSpec would be perfect ,1218772,1,8108
"The author has very well given a background of the system and the problem, which forms a lucid idea of the changes intended by the author in the system. However, the author has only given a very high level view of the changes to be incorporated in the system. There is not much of an explanation, nor an implementation.",1219727,1,8108
"Yes, the deisgn appears to be totally sound. The changes proposed are very standardized, and follows appropriate industry standards.",1219728,-1,8108
"Yes, the design is very simple, lucid and efficient.",1219729,-1,8108
"The visualization is by far the best part of this writeup. Also, it's visualization is among the best I've reviewed till date. The author has put in a lot of efforts for the same. The diagrams make the architecture and the problem statement very simple to understand.",1219730,-1,8108
"The author has made a test plan, but it is ""reactive"" instead of ""proactive"". The test plan for the changes to be incorporated could be improved a bit further by further consideration about the usage scenario.",1219731,1,8108
I understand what the team is supposed to do to the expertiza system.,1219591,-1,8108
"It was weird that two of the bugs they were assigned don't exist, but that's not the team's fault.",1219593,-1,8108
This team consistently uses great diagrams that add to their documentation's clarity significantly.,1219594,-1,8108
The tests are really in depth for each issue the team will be fixing.,1219595,-1,8108
"After the first review, the design has improved significantly. The proposed design clearly defines the changes being made by the team.",1220814,-1,8107
Not enough explanation,1219289,1,8107
"Yes, the proposed solutions part clearly stated that they will go through each review to compare the new review score, etc, and then they will store the review URL. However, the solution is not concrete enough and is a little bit hard to follow. It should be great if there's more details in stating about how to loop through each reviews.  ",1220157,1,8107
"They have a paragraph saying what they are going to do, but it could be broken up into parts with images for better understanding",1218891,-1,8107
"The authors have explained well what changes they wish to make and how they plan to implement those changes. I would suggest them to add more details like, ""where do they store the list of responses more than the notification threshold"". Overall good job.",1219871,-1,8107
A format of the proposed email to be sent would be helpful,1219311,-1,8107
"No, their didn't include enough text explanation.",1220668,1,8107
"Yes, they include this part in the Proposed Solutions field. It would be better if they use visualization to let the readers better understand the flow.",1220217,-1,8107
Not well structured and less content,1219500,1,8107
The team has provided a code snippet which includes solution to their problem statement. They have described the code and their proposed changes,1219470,-1,8107
I know exactly what this team is doing.,1219586,-1,8107
"The design document contains all the necessary sections but fails to provide adequate explanation of the changes to be made. The authors have done a good job at explaining the current scenario, also identified the code where the changes are to be made. They have identified the need of a new function and its purpose, but fail to provide a design of the intended changes, i.e. new functions or modifications in the functions, any need to use different variables etc. The authors have not added any changes relevant to the previous suggestions.",1219621,1,8107
"Yes, the problem statement and the proposed changes have been clearly explained.",1220274,-1,8107
The design has improved and updates has been done and it is easy to comprehend the changes to be made to the system.,1220344,-1,8107
There has been a significant improvement in the level of details provided. The author can further improve the document by providing the details of the design pattern to be used.,1220815,-1,8107
Design is okay,1219290,-1,8107
"The design is sound because it follows the problem statement and the instructions. I doubt if it follows the DRY principle while looping through each review, because that might be already done in the Expertiza. In terms of patterns, I think here it needs to use the factory pattern, altough it's not stated in the design.",1220158,1,8107
"Design does seem to be sound, but complex. As mentioned in the earlier review, I am unsure if looping over each review is the correct thing to do or not. Maybe the team discussed this with the mentor and decided against it as no new information has been added in the document. If so, I would only suggest the team to include the complexity of the design in the document.",1219872,-1,8107
"Yes, but they didnt show their principles and pattern very well.",1220669,1,8107
"The design seems workable. Maybe they can come up a more sound design. For example, they can try many ways to define the notification limit.",1220218,-1,8107
"By looking at the flow-charts and UML diagrams submitted by the team, their solution appears to be sound.",1219471,-1,8107
It seems as though this team's approach was well designed.,1219587,-1,8107
"As they have provided a very high-level idea of their proposed solution, there is no pseudocode or any class diagram which helps explain the design adequately. You can improvise the design by including flow of the methods, to highlight how and where will your new method come into picture. However, looking at the intended modifications, it seems that the changes follow DRY principles, and changes are not unnecessary. There is also no need of using any design patterns as per the required changes.",1219622,1,8107
Author could have provided the design pattern they need to implement.,1220345,1,8107
The design seems to be pretty straightforward.,1220816,-1,8107
Very basic design,1219291,1,8107
"The design is simple, although it could be better if it has more concrete examples.",1220159,-1,8107
"Yes, the design is as simple as it can get. Understanding the principle is not hard. But making it simple should also not make it costly. Good work to the team if the instructors were looking for something this simple :)",1219873,-1,8107
"Yes, it simple but some parts are not easy to understand.",1220670,1,8107
The design is simple and really better than before.,1220219,0,8107
The team has provided diagrams that make it easier for the reader to understand the workflow of the system and the changes that they have proposed to implement the solution.,1219472,-1,8107
"The way the team plans to loop through each review to calculate a review score seems slightly more complex than necessary, but I agree with them taking this apporach as it will allow them to break down the reason why the scores are different.",1219588,-1,8107
"The design does appear to be simple, as they have not planned to modify any of the existing methods. Their new method will interact with Response, AssignmentQuestionnaire model, and then link the assignment to the review in the email. However, they have not mentioned if they have planned any data structure/variable to store the assignment link and pass it on to the method where email notification will be sent. But, i suppose that storing it in a variable will suffice. ",1219623,-1,8107
"The design and application flow appear to be as simple as possible, as well as the proposed code changes snippet provided.",1220276,-1,8107
The design seems simple.,1220346,-1,8107
The author uses the UML diagram to properly describe the system. ,1220817,-1,8107
No visualization,1219292,1,8107
"There are a lot of diagrams, but the application flow and the UML Diagram doesn't look very clear. We can hardly see the words in the UML Diagram. Also, the diagrams seem to not fit each other. How does the application diagram and the Uml diagram connect to each other? There's no clear instructions. Also, I don't think a screen shot of code in the design doc is a good idea. I think it could be better if the changes expected to be made can be described in a more abstract fashion. ",1220160,1,8107
"The UML diagrams given in the document list the process flow for testing/understanding the changes which will be made in the document. But, unfortunately, no diagram exists which describe the changes to be made.   I would suggest the team to add diagrams for the pseudo-code they may have written.",1219874,1,8107
"Yes, the use of visualization is great.",1220671,-1,8107
"They used the UML diagrams, it really help me a lot when reading the wiki page. Maybe they can also make diagrams about the changes they are going to make.",1220220,-1,8107
"As mentioned, the team has provided UML diagrams stating the two actors in their system- Student, Instructor and their interaction with the email module and database.",1219473,-1,8107
"The visualization aids used currently are application flow diagram, and use cases. They are useful to understand the scenario of the problem statement. However, a sequence or a communication diagram will really be beneficial to understand how the method interfaces with the other  methods. This will help identify if the new method impacts other functionalities and will portray the proposed solution efficiently.",1219624,-1,8107
"There are UML and application flow diagrams included with the design document, which serve to make the proposed design changes much clearer.",1220277,-1,8107
Proper diagrams are used by the team. ,1220347,-1,8107
The document does contain a test plan which can definitely be extended to incorporate certain negative test cases.,1220818,-1,8107
No test plan,1219293,1,8107
"There's a testing plan. Although the testing plan seems to cover the fuctionalities, it is not clearly stated. The tester should log in as what role? how to select a teams assignment and review it? How to log out and check the instructor's email? which instructor email should the tester check? These questions should have been answered in the test plan.",1220161,1,8107
They have one scenario. maybe a few more could help better test their work,1218895,-1,8107
"The test plan section unfortunately lists no concrete test that the team would write. Checking the functionality manually, and writing rspec tests for the code written are extremely different, and I would suggest the team to have a dedicated test plan section, mentioning the controller/model they wish to test, the objects they would need to mock etc.",1219875,1,8107
some additional tests can be added,1219315,-1,8107
"Yes, the doc contains test plan, but they are not specific.",1220672,-1,8107
They did include a test plan. It would be better if they also test the instructor side.,1220221,-1,8107
The test plan seems overly simplistic. It only tests whether the team's changes work in the most drastic scenario possible. It seems like they should have more boundary value tests and more test cases to account for their new method of looping through the reviews to compare new reviews with previous ones.,1219590,1,8107
"I think that there is a huge scope for test plan improvisation. The current test plan is just a step-by-step procedure to test if the reviewer receives a mail fir conflicting reviews. The test plan should also include test cases to test whether the link is present in the email notification. Also, is the link correct and navigable? The test plan should also cover the pits where the functionality may fail, so as to ensure smooth functioning of the system.",1219625,1,8107
Test plan is as simple as required for the problem statement in question.,1220278,-1,8107
Design doc includes the test plan but more detail on negative test cases would have been better.,1220348,-1,8107
"Yes, the explanations provided for changes to be made are clearly mentioned . The authors are very clear what and where to make changes. Use of flowchart makes reviewer to understand their approach more quickly and easily. Suggestion: No test plan is included in the project",1219809,1,8083
The authors have explained the changes in depth and with proper details.,1219041,-1,8083
Yes the author has explained the adequately the changes to be made to the system by giving a detailed flow diagram of the workflow of the the would be implementing the functionality of keeping a track of the review time of a student,1220548,1,8083
Actually they talked a little about previous work from E1791 project and a lot about what they gonna do. But it's better to have some contrast.  ,1220794,1,8083
the design design dicument seems to be written well and organised into nice categories so as to be easily readable. Though the team hasn't  made any changes since the last update. The team could have added a UML diagram and test plan in order to better explain the project.,1220603,1,8083

Not so good structure. ,1220795,1,8083
The team has clearly defined the objective of the project. The have also stated the approach that they are about to use to solve the problem. They have also clearly added the schema for storing the time information that the user will spend on a particular review. The only thing the team could have added was to create a UML diagram defining the classes that are changed or added  and adding what attributes are added and what functions modified/added. The team haven't mentioned any design pattern as such but the proposed  plan explains the idea well.,1220604,1,8083

"The problems are described very nicely. When it comes to changes to be made, files to be modified are given. I feel more explanation needs to be given with respect to changes in these files for each problem stating why this file needs to be changed and what the impact will be.",1219886,1,8066
The doc is very well written. Its like a blueprint to the project. Really appreciate the team efforts!,1219212,-1,8066
I understand what the team is supposed to do to the expertiza system.,1219591,-1,8066
Team have explained the Problem/Steps to Reproduce are really very clear. Solution part could have been explained better. Overall its a good work,1219991,1,8066
"The team has included all the details required to implement the given requirement. The wiki has complete details related to requirements , analysis of current designs and changes required to achieve the required functionality. overall great job !  The team did a great work in analyzing the issues and designing solutions for the issues.

Clearly explained with diagrams and UML diagrams.,1220325,-1,8066
"  The design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the use case diagram in which the users are student and instructor and the data base is where the actions are stored in the database and the retrieved from the same for the case of reviews information.  Also, they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the Application Flow section so as to elucidate the problem statement. ",1218858,-1,8066
"Since the project is aimed at fixing the issues, no design patterns need to be used.",1219213,-1,8066
The team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made. the design looks good and easy to implement. great work done !  ,1219785,-1,8066
Mostly yes. But the working flow could have been explained better with the flow diagrams.,1218769,1,8066
The design document is easy to comprehend.Have explained in detail about the problem but not about the solution.,1218770,1,8066
The design appears to be simple and straightforward to implement. The team has also included all the changes that will be made to achieve the desired results.  Great Work !,1219786,-1,8066
"It was weird that two of the bugs they were assigned don't exist, but that's not the team's fault.",1219593,-1,8066
The explanation of each of the issues in details is done very well but it does seem to be complicated unless files to be modified and solutions are read.,1219214,-1,8066
"Yes, the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the review section. ",1218859,-1,8066

"Yes, simple straightforward solutions.",1220645,-1,8066
The visuals used are excellent but it would have been nice to not overwhelm the reader.,1219215,-1,8066
Great use of mock ups and UML diagrams. It makes understanding the issues easier. Looks like a great amount of thought has gone into making it. ,1220646,-1,8066
The visualization is great. All the flow diagrams and required screenshots are in place as required.,1219909,-1,8066
"The visualization is by far the best part of this writeup. Also, it's visualization is among the best I've reviewed till date. The author has put in a lot of efforts for the same. The diagrams make the architecture and the problem statement very simple to understand.",1219730,-1,8066
"A lots of visuals, very helpful when viewers walk through the design. ",1220631,-1,8066
Great work by the team on UML diagrams. ,1220327,-1,8066
"Yes, the diagrams are clear to show how the system works. They have even gone a step ahead to show how they have thought of resolving the problem at each and every step of the Expertiza review section and the message popups they receive for the same. ",1218860,-1,8066
This team consistently uses great diagrams that add to their documentation's clarity significantly.,1219594,-1,8066
The team has included a lot of visual aids which complements the document making it a lot easier to understand.  Great work with the UI mockups / project design / UML diagrams.,1219787,-1,8066
Given UML diagram which are explaining the functionality appropriately but class diagram would have been better to explain the detail code level change ,1218771,-1,8066
"Testing plan is not included. However, somewhat of an idea can be obtained from the steps to reproduce.",1220647,1,8066
There are some test plans in place and others will be done after the bugs are generated. Suggestions: It would have been great to have screenshots of the test plans.,1219910,-1,8066
"The author has made a test plan, but it is ""reactive"" instead of ""proactive"". The test plan for the changes to be incorporated could be improved a bit further by further consideration about the usage scenario.",1219731,1,8066

"Yes, they have a working test plan in mind and also they have thought of the ways in which they are going to test the various edge cases for the various issues at hand.",1218861,-1,8066
Tests are given at a very high level and need to be described properly.,1219890,1,8066
The aspect of re-producing the issues are very clearly mentioned and hence tests are written briefly which can be easily understood.,1219216,-1,8066
The tests are really in depth for each issue the team will be fixing.,1219595,-1,8066
"The team has included the test plan design but the documentation is missing on the scenarios that will be tested after the implementation, How the team will be testing it , what are the automated test that will be created and also the manual test plan. How an end user can test the end-to- end requirements should also be a part of the design.",1219788,1,8066
Test plans are present but have not explained in detail. A brief description  of the use case with the test plan and RSpec would be perfect ,1218772,1,8066
"Yes, the explanations provided for changes to be made are clearly mentioned . The authors are very clear what and where to make changes. Use of flowchart makes reviewer to understand their approach more quickly and easily. Suggestion: No test plan is included in the project",1219809,-1,8075
The authors have explained the changes in depth and with proper details.,1219041,-1,8075
Yes the author has explained the adequately the changes to be made to the system by giving a detailed flow diagram of the workflow of the the would be implementing the functionality of keeping a track of the review time of a student,1220548,-1,8075
Actually they talked a little about previous work from E1791 project and a lot about what they gonna do. But it's better to have some contrast.  ,1220794,1,8075
the design design dicument seems to be written well and organised into nice categories so as to be easily readable. Though the team hasn't  made any changes since the last update. The team could have added a UML diagram and test plan in order to better explain the project.,1220603,1,8075
"Yes, the author has explained the scope of the project very clearly and has specified the changes to be made in the project to accomplish the goal.",1220082,-1,8075
Yes the changes are well explained,1219187,-1,8075
Explained very well.,1219016,-1,8075
Yes.,1217701,-1,8075
"The design document was well-written initially too, and still is.",1219250,-1,8075
The design seems to follow appropriate principles and pattern. It is simple and clearly explains what needs to be done and where the changes will be made. Suggestion: addition of screen mock-ups to document will help reviewers a lot.,1219810,1,8075
The design follows the required principle and the exact required patterns.,1219042,-1,8075
Yes the design is quite well understood and properly explained in a detailed manner through the flow diagram,1220549,-1,8075
Not so good structure. ,1220795,-1,8075
The team has clearly defined the objective of the project. The have also stated the approach that they are about to use to solve the problem. They have also clearly added the schema for storing the time information that the user will spend on a particular review. The only thing the team could have added was to create a UML diagram defining the classes that are changed or added  and adding what attributes are added and what functions modified/added. The team haven't mentioned any design pattern as such but the proposed  plan explains the idea well.,1220604,1,8075
"The design seems pretty accurate, the schema of the database table records all the necessary details with reasonable granularity.",1220083,-1,8075
The design seems appropriate to the issue at hand,1219188,1,8075
yes it does appear to be following appropriate principles.,1219017,-1,8075

"Yes, I think so.",1220796,-1,8075
"The design document is very simple and easy to read. Detailed explanation about the objective, the proposed plan for each objective, database schema and the user flow chart is defined clearly. The team could have added CRC cards to improve detailing about the code changes.",1220605,-1,8075
"The design isn't extremely simple to understand at first glance. But given that the feature to be implemented is slightly complicated, the team has made efforts to make it as clear as possible.",1220084,1,8075
It is clear and simple.,1219189,-1,8075
yes it does. they have given the proposed solution which appears to be simple.,1219018,-1,8075
The design appears to be simple and is easy to understand.,1219252,-1,8075
"Yes, the database design and flowchart gives a clear picture what system will do after the required changes. Suggestion: add before & after changes screen mock-ups to your document.",1219812,-1,8075
The provided flowcharts are visually sufficient to display the changes made to the system.,1219044,-1,8075
They have include a flow chart to illustrate how the part gonna work.,1220797,-1,8075
Great flowchart! It helps to see all the possible scenarios in a compact manner.,1219398,-1,8075
As such the project description does not ask for any visualizations.  But visualization in terms of UML diagram or a CRC cards would have been a helpful way to make the description better.,1220606,1,8075
"Yes, the given flowchart describes the sequence of events and how the application behaves in response to those events.",1220085,-1,8075
The flow chart is good and aids in understanding better.,1219190,-1,8075
"great diagram, explains everything.",1219019,-1,8075
Clean flow chart,1217704,-1,8075
"Visualization offers only a flow chart, but other UML diagrams like class diagram would have been more helpful.,  ",1219253,1,8075
"No, it doesn't.  Suggestion: Team should add a test plan which includes tests for testing the required changes.",1219813,1,8075
The test plan is provided in the functionality implementation describing the functionality and how it will be tested.,1219045,-1,8075
Haven't included the test plan,1220552,1,8075
No,1220798,-1,8075
cannot find test plan.,1218702,-1,8075
"There is no test plan. For this project it could be difficult to test the exact time returned. However, it would be a good idea to test that the report page in fact shows the statistics.",1219399,0,8075
The project does not have any testing involved,1220607,-1,8075
The team hasn't included any test plans in the design document. I feel testing is really important in this project as there are many 'if's' in the use-case.,1220086,1,8075
No test plan is included. They can have manual testing for the ui at least if automated is out of scope.,1219191,1,8075
"No test plan added, they where missing the last time as well. You guys should add them telling how you exactly plan to test the changes you make, even if its a small change it should be mentioned how it was tested.",1219020,1,8075
Not included.,1217705,-1,8075
No test plan provided.,1219254,-1,8075

The visuals used are excellent but it would have been nice to not overwhelm the reader.,1219215,1,8036
This team consistently uses great diagrams that add to their documentation's clarity significantly.,1219594,-1,8036
The team has included a lot of visual aids which complements the document making it a lot easier to understand.  Great work with the UI mockups / project design / UML diagrams.,1219787,-1,8036

How an end user can test the end-to- end requirements should also be a part of the design.",1219788,1,8036
Test plans are present but have not explained in detail. A brief description  of the use case with the test plan and RSpec would be perfect ,1218772,1,8036
"While I'm awaiting to receive the details which are pending on the implementation, I feel the general nature of the changes is well-explained. ",1219087,-1,8044
Yes the approach is explained in detail.,1219273,-1,8044
Yes. The design is clear and the details are succinct.,1219142,-1,8044
The authors have adequately mentioned the desired changes in the approach and design section. The problem statement gives the gist of the issue at hand including adding feature to make student's reviews public. The proposals specified are effective to deal with the issue by creating a new MVC framework.,1220653,-1,8044
"The overall design looks good. However, the author can add more details about the design principles being followed and appropriate patterns to be used.",1220684,-1,8044
"Yes, Design shows a good amount of work to be done. Team is not using any design pattern.  ",1219542,-1,8044
The design is proper.,1219274,-1,8044
"Confronted with a tricky problem in creating links between different assignments across semesters to aggregate the reviews, I was really impressed with the way they plan to accomplish this feature.",1219088,-1,8044
"I am not convinced with the ""similar_assignments"" table schema. For an assignment Ax, there is a foreign key that points to an assignment Ay such that Ax can be an assignment in say 2018 and Ay can be the same assignment in 2017. But what if one of the reviews from assignment Az which was in 2015 was really good and we need to include that as a sample and also include another review from Aw from 2016 as a sample.  According my understanding, this above requirement cannot be met with the current DB table design. Something that the team may look into.",1219143,-1,8044
The design and fixes are coherently described and are logical to be implemented for the given functionality. The issues are stated properly allowing the reader to understand it and the fixes suggested are enlisted in an appropriate manner.,1220654,-1,8044
Simple design,1219613,-1,8044
"The steps taken by the team to implement the functionality is very clear and detailed. as stated above, the approach discusses the  step wise action that the team is going to take for the implementation.",1220620,-1,8044
Design doc is not complex and every section of the menu explains the itself with simplest term possible.,1219543,-1,8044
The design is concised and clear. Only makes the required changes and introduces no duplications.,1220460,-1,8044
"For as difficult a problem as linking assignments from one year to the next is, they present an admirably simple design.",1219089,-1,8044
It is simple enough and also achieves the required features,1219275,-1,8044
"The design looks simplified but there might be some edge cases that needs handling such as - What if a student makes his/her review public, this review is selected by the power user to create a sample and then the student wishes to make the review private?",1219144,-1,8044
The design makes it clear to understand the procedure adapted to realize the goal. The authors have made it a point to describe the tasks carried out in a simpler manner allowing the reader to realize the approach towards the issue. ,1220655,-1,8044
"The team has represented the workflow through the UML diagrams which is very helpful to understand the flow of the requirement with multiple actors involved in the system. However, it would have been more helpful if they could add the design flow diagrams to explain the database design changes they are suggesting to be done. The new table they are suggesting to make and  the fields they would map to could be shown through a entity relationship diagram which will make it easy for the end user to understand the attributes and the relationship of different entities involved due to the functionality change.",1220621,-1,8044
The team has not used any class diagram.,1219832,-1,8044
No visualization,1219614,1,8044
"The Use Case diagram added is drawn well and helps explaining the system. Team could have added, screenshots of the Expertiza pages, that would have helped us understand whoch part of the system is changing well.",1219544,1,8044
The usecase diagram is helpful but does not help much as it just explains what is provided in the approach section. More in-depth functionality of what each user will do or how will the design flow (flow chart) would be more helpful.,1220461,1,8044
some mock UI where this is going to be implemented would be helpful,1219340,-1,8044
The UML diagram is very good and makes understanding very easy,1219276,0,8044
"I like the Use Case Diagram, but I would like class diagrams or a database visualization too, so it's easier to understand how the cross-course assignment linking will work.",1219090,-1,8044
The UML Use Case diagram takes into consideration the system specifications and the manner in which the users interact with each other in the process. It makes it easy to analyze how the implementation can take place in the current scenario. ,1220656,1,8044
There is one box for both review controller and assignment controller. A better picture of how they handle each event differently would have been helpful.,1219145,-1,8044
No test cases,1219615,-1,8044
"The test plan gives a black box testing view which is good and easy to understand. But it would be helpful to give more details about what functionalities are tested. Like a new DB table is added. So tests related to that and corner cases such as an old assignment gets removed , foreign key constraint so how will that test be conducted would make it better.",1219146,1,8044
The test plan section properly describes the flow that needs to be followed by each actor involved in the process. This could be enhanced either by providing a flow diagram or adding certain test case snippets for the scenarios.,1220657,-1,8044
