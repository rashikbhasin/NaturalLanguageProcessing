problem the topic assigned to this team is unit testing on menu rb so they had to create rspec tests for the methods in the model file menu rb in the new file spec models menu_spec rb the team has precisely tested the functionalities of every method including all relevant scenarios as contexts of both the nested class node and the enclosing class menu the names used for mock objects and literals are intuitive and follow the ruby s convention there were a few issues regarding incorrect indentation and the verbosity of the spec code in the previous round the team has rectified those in this round in my view giving additional comments for code in rspec is superfluous as the tests are already embedded with information on what it intends to do through the use of describe context and it methods   the code is dry through the use of reusable mock objects like menu nodes site controllers content pages controller actions items and roles which span across the entire block where it is defined additionally the use of before each method to initialize and set up these objects further dry s up the spec for the methods
problem the tests were mentioned in the report but not in the pull request there was also no coverage information the approach looks good though

problem the tests given tests there changes which is enough
problem the tests for the controllers and models were basic scaffold tests with not much meaning
problem the tests describe the code they are testing not the behavior functionality like for in this scenario the controller_action attribute of the menu item is unavailable in this case the expectation is that a customized path  is assigned to the url variable this just specifies what  variable  is being updated and i have no idea what workflow it represents this is at least a brittle description for a test suppose tomorrow the variable is removed or some function ends up calculating the value while the test it self might pass if the change was passive the description is now stale and will confuse any user trying to update the tests
problem the testing was thorough although one model and one controller individually did not appear to be tested thoroughly

problem the testing of initialize is very well described with descriptions of how and why the tests were written in that particular fashion however all other tests are not discussed when looking at the github it seems that there were many more tests that were not elaborated upon the test descriptions were included at the bottom of the page but without explanation of implementation or purpose it would be helpful to include more of the test cases if anything it would be a good idea to discuss them without the code inclusion like that of initialize because that section of the wiki is very well presented

problem the team has implemented test for the user model and controller however it would make for better design if they used the rspec framework to do the test more comprehensive test cases could be tested such as if the passwords of the user don t match
problem the team has implemented proper functions and has used a proper naming convention however there is scope to add some comments for ex in the new method get_feedback_assessments_for method which will return a feedback assessment the team could have added some comments about the logic implemented apart from this the code is concise and good coding and ruby practices have been followed

problem the team has implemented modules like login signup logout list all companies and list all houses however they lack in many functionalities and under each module so they are not properly implemented they lack validations session management and things like multiple same email addresses can be registered with different users   hence no the team has not thoroughly tested at least one model or controller

problem the team has implemented automated tests there could be some addition to the test which i have suggested above
problem the team has heeded to the advice given in the last round and explained their tests in a more detailed manner i do feel that the write up is well written and covers almost all the important points of the project but i do feel images showing their tests running successfully could be added to the results part of the writeup
problem the team has has listed the 2 files that they propose to change namely   the view   app views response response html erb and the partial app views submitted_content _self_review html erb however they could have described what these files currently do and their purpose in the documentation the authors have embedded screenshots of how the ui of the review page will look after the analyze button will be included they have specified that a pop up showing the suggestion metrics pertaining to a review namely   volume sentiment suggestion praise and criticism metrics will be generated once the button is clicked

problem the team has given a design flow that underlines the basic way in which they are planning to target the issue at hand it can make use by giving an example as to how the output might look and the document must also describe the tools that would be used for achieving the task
problem the team has followed ruby coding standard however function names could be refactored for example the function get_time_diff_btw_due_date_and_now name is just too long and can be modified into get_time_diff or any other meaningful name also it is advisable to keep the function name singular or append the name with list so instead of using find_participant_emails the team can use find_participant_email_list
problem the team has followed good ruby coding practices all the code is neatly written and well indented however the code has no comments
problem the team has followed good coding practices with  sufficient priority on mvc model each model controller view has a specific role which has not been repeated in other parts of the code   i am giving 3 5 because 1 the code would have better readability if sufficient amount of comments are included in the code also if the role of each model controller view is documented in the code file at the beginning then other contributors may feel easy to follow the code 2 dry concept can be used to a better extent

problem the team has explicitly mentioned the classes and the name of the files where they have made changes however i would suggest the team to add the filenames above code snippets that they have attached in the write up this would make it easier for the reader to follow the workflow
problem the team has explained the problem statement well and detailed the implementation  they plan to do also the  appropriate test cases have been included but  i feel  the  team should have included more  explanation in their implementation
problem the team has explained the problem statement well  and has done job in explaining the flow for every user with diagrams for them however the team needs to add the design approach and the testing plan for the project
problem the team has explained the manual testing process suggestion include how the go functionality is actually tested in ruby include edge cases for the testing functionality
problem the team has explained how to fix the issues but not clear enough it is confusing what is each pre existing methods they have used done and why these methods were used

problem the team has effectively worked on multiple commits yet these suggestions need to be followed   suggestions   1 commit message carries great importance for the first level of code change analysis so this has to explain the changes to a decent extent commit messages in this repository is vague if they are meaningful it reduces some effort in analysing the code timeline

problem the team has done well to follow the ruby style guide and has ensured to keep the code dry however my suggesstion is to add comments in the code for the reader to follow the code easily
problem the team has done tremendous job in adding visualization aids they have added application flow diagrams and visualized images they have also included screenshots to explain the code functionality implementation of enabling self reviews and score pages this makes the document descriptive and very easy to read and understand
problem the team has done great job by describing the approach and explaining same in detail by adding a pictorial representation of the pattern used   however it would be more helpful if the team could add details about the names of the classes and the exact code changes done in the wiki page as it would help anyone in future to understand what are the exact changes implemented in this way the comparing code with the original code in github can be avoided

problem the team has completed the missing code in the file oscillator_node rs which generates different wave forms like sine square sawtooth and triangle they then created the file oscillator rs that generates  objects and calls methods to run the different oscillator type examples the code in both these rust files have good comments that clearly explain what every snippet does and the significance of variables this made it easy to follow the syntax and semantics of a new programming language like rust rust is a systems programming language that focuses on memory safety and concurrency the variable names used are intuitive and the code is well indented one issue that i can point out here is that the code is lengthy and complex with a lot of redundancy especially those that define the audio context destination node oscillator and a few other local variables in the file oscillator rs are repeated for every oscillator waveform and can certainly be encapsulated in one function that can be called only once in the file

problem the team has committed changes during round 2 though the changes haven t been spaced evenly most of them are close to the deadline also the changes haven t even spaced evenly the names of the commits were descriptive
problem the team has committed changes after round one however there are less number of commits and are not spread throughout the life of the project a single commit is used for various functionalities which makes it difficult to understand the exact functionality changes the commit messages are not appropriate which makes it harder to find out what the fix is about there are commits even after the round 2 deadline
problem the team has clearly defined the objective of the project the have also stated the approach that they are about to use to solve the problem they have also clearly added the schema for storing the time information that the user will spend on a particular review the only thing the team could have added was to create a uml diagram defining the classes that are changed or added  and adding what attributes are added and what functions modified added the team haven t mentioned any design pattern as such but the proposed  plan explains the idea well

problem the team has a very well documented history of commits   the commit history seems to be well spaced over the entire period of the project development cycle the team has commits in each of the submission periods and have kept on adding functionalities and updating documentation the team could have updated their readme a little bit more and added information regarding all the functionalities being assigned to individual roles and how the user experience is set up also the team could have adde information on how to run tests in readme md file
problem the team has a proper concern on mvc model each model controller view has a specific role which has not been repeated in other parts of the code   still i am giving 3 5 because 1 the project has neglected dry principle in many of the instances   this has resulted in a bulkier code 2 as many authors  say a code looks good if it appears like reading a novel this appearance of a novel like look is missing in many places which can grab other user s attention 3 the code would have better readability if sufficient amount of comments are included in the code also if the role of each model controller view is documented in the code file at the beginning then other contributors may feel easy to follow the code
problem the team had not added a link to the wiki during round 1 of the review   issues to be fixed section seems incomplete and not the right kind of writing please review and try to add more details on the issues that are being addressed otherwise the wiki looks good with relevant diagrams and code snippets
problem the team had added test cases in the first round of submission itself the overall coverage has decreased by 1 04 the test covers the logic implemented by the students but reduces the overall coverage the team did a good work in using capybara and testing the web functionalities too
problem the team gave fixtures for the issues exist but to make deployment it is better to add more tests to make sure the function work properly
problem the team gave clear explanation of what functions include in this project besides they gave some examples to help us to understand how the functions work and should work in the system so i can point out the issue easily by following their instruction
problem the team followed good practices no repetition of the code dry principles uses how there is an empty controller though which is the commons_controller rb what is its purpose

problem the team didn t no provide the link for the deployment but according to the video they provided the features worked well
problem the team did not seem to submit their changes throughout the project the team have made changes only after round 1 and nothing on round 1 there are a total of 19 commits it would have been better if the commits have been made with messages so that others can know what changes have been made in the project
problem the team did not perform any changes from the first round no test cases were added and the coverage remained the same the test cases from the previous round considerably fulfill the range of the project
problem the team did not have a writeup in the last submission in this submission they do have a writeup with the problem statement the files modified approach to solving the problems and test plan this seems to be a significant improvement from the last submission as for the screencast links i think one link is absent and the other one is a youtube video of the same project submitted last year please check this i think you have added the wrong link i would also suggest that a references section needs to be added to the wiki page so that the deployment pull request and other project reference links are shown
problem the team did not commit their changes throughout the project period the changes were committed in round 2
problem the team did not attach the link for the github repo along with the other files submitted this makes it difficult to comment upon the commits made however from the video link it can be seen that the test cases have improved to give a full path coverage

problem the team did not add any test cases   the coverage did not increase as a result of that   suggestion unit test cases should have been written as a part of the final deliverable
problem the team did not add any test cases since they had achieved a 100 coverage in the first round itself however certain changes made to the test cases included using proper naming conventions for attributes and following the dry principle effectively throughout the model file
problem the team did change the project as there are 2 new commits the ci build is still failing
problem the team did a good job in explaining the problem statements for each issue and  providing their proposed solutions the purpose of the project is clear from the document as is a composite of several  independent issues the problem is that testing plan is missing from the project i would suggest starting from the most basic test cases that check the functionality e g one spec per issue and then elaborating from there moreover while  fixing some issues like  1008 and 1065 consists of a  small  modification to the existing code there are other cases where the design decisions are not  provided and it would be better for the team to include some justifications and possible discussions of design patterns the  document extensively uses diagrams that depict application flows for each use case which is impressive
problem the team could have added more test cases as they have mentioned about refactoring the code the refactored code and the screenshots of the test cases would have been better to display in the wiki for future students

problem the team added more information from the last time which aided in a better explanation of the problem good job team
problem the team added many tests they seem like they would have high coverage but with the failing build this cannot be confirmed easily
problem the team added a test case however coveralls shows the following   overall coverage decreased 17 2 to  19 566 i interpreted this as as decrease in coverage
problem the system works well all the functionality has been implemented i ran the project and it worked as intended the back button issue in ui has been fixed
problem the system works well in most of the cases except when the realtor creates his company and then after successfully creating the company he get s an option to edit his company details but then when he clicks the edit button it redirects to the homepage and is unable to edit his company info unless he choses to belong to the particular company a minor bug but still breaks the consistency
problem the system works well and performs all the operations correctly 1 for the aforementioned errors in code
problem the system works exactly how it is supposed to work i could not find any functionalities that are still failing no bugs or error messages it would have been better if the realtor could send replies to inquiries directly from the application than opening a separate mail application
problem the system works as intended however the flow for system given in the wiki is quite confusing the test cases were edited to cover all scenarios
problem the system works as expected and common functionality is working but still needs to focus on some areas 1 not able to sign in as admin with preconfigured account 2 how to add inquiries or to an interest list

problem the system properly handles the relationships where a real estate company can have multiple realtors also it supports a realtor to create multiple houses and the house hunters to add multiple houses to their interest list
problem the system performs all the desired functionalities a shoutout to the idea for the auto filled inquiries i really liked that feature where the inquiry is already filled after which the user gets an option to edit the inquiry some parts need improvement for ex the link new houses in the house list redirects to the  users edit link its a minor issue which could be looked upon the layout of the homepage for house hunter can be fixed as links overlap each other also the houses list shows edit destroy options for the entire house list that s a bug which needs fixing

problem the system operation is verified and works as intended as demonstrated from the video   also all the test scenarios are covered
problem the system operation from ui works as expected by the project i was able to verify that the rejoinder is given by the team instead of team member the rejoinder is also made easily available to the user by providing easy navigation options to give feedback to reviewers hence making the ui more user friendly the author feedback section contains the team s collective feedback to reviewers of particular assignments most of the task is to refactor code so that it complies with the new requirement of team rejoinders and the features work as expected
problem the system just works in few functions even though authors fix the problem that admin cannot log in in the first round   it  still lack many functions that the system supposed to have from the admin perspetive admin can edit show and delete any users create show edit and delete any companies but it cannot create a new user besides when i click the link of house the 404 page jump out which means that there is no way that i can see any houses listed from realtor s perspertive a realtor can sign up and log in apart from these there is no other fuction that realized in the system a realtor cannot switch his her role or edit his her profile cannot list houses choose company she he belongs to and reply any inquiries from hunters from the perspertive of hunter authors just realized the function of signup and sign in besides those it doesn t have any other functions that the system is supposed to have besides there are some problems in log in part when i  log out as admin and log in as a realtor or a hunter i can still access

problem the system is in great shape it is easily one of the best i have seen and they still didn t implement all of the expected functionality
problem the system has all the required functionality however it would also be useful if the readme file explained where some of the features are incorporated for instance the submit inquiry field is located on the show page for the houses this is not immediately intuitive it could help if that is mentioned in the readme
problem the system has all the basic functionalities as per the program description as per the last feedback validation checks for invalid data has been added to the application however the system still does not have the null checks for field   for example if a user creates a house without adding most of the details the application breaks   https housefocus herokuapp com houses
problem the system doesn t check all edge cases a realtor can see company listings even without choosing a company the readme does not outline exactly how all edge cases are handled
problem the system does not portray good database design first of all there are two separate tables for enquiries and reply to enquiries which is highly not normalised also the fact that there are 3 separate tables for the three types of users is also very in efficient and non scalable it does make an attempt to map the various relationships but it seems it is not properly tested and is prone to many bugs

problem the suggestions have not been improved comments aren t explanatory and does not give an idea about what the author intended to do it would be good to include meaningful comments debug code is still in the commit even though we may used debug code like the puts statement we should not commit these as they could create junk data in the application log please consider removing them
problem the  submission is about adding tests to the project  and authors have done a great job of adding 92 code coverage   i would have liked to see more ve test cases for example cases such as user with incorrect names as of now the test cases only checks of the user name is present or not how about the case where user name is such that it is not allowed user class throws an exception or add method can this could have been documented
problem the structure of codes is not very good that is for a it statement there are two many things include in it to be tested it is better to separate   the test cases clearly besides the objects seem not store in factories properly
problem the stated design seems to be appropriate following a close representation of the current project bidding structure would prove successful it would have been beneficial to supply more details on how the design would be implemented and could help in the justification of the choices this team used
problem the source code is mostly written in a coherent way and is straightforward to follow   the context blocks are extensively used which increases the project documentation the commented chunks of code blocks that were present in the 1st round are mostly removed there are still a few instances left and i would suggest to remove them because they reduce the overall readability i would also suggest  to decompose  the it block inside the final_versions_from_reviewer by moving the common setup to a before each block and spreading the assertions across several it statements   another improvement would be to remove the xit code blocks because they only increase the clutter and do not add any value to the code adding one comment explaining why the blocks are no longer necessary would do the job

problem the source code is mostly following standard ruby practices but there is a room for improvement firstly the source contains large chunks of code blocks that are commented out i would suggest removing those chunks as they reduce the overall readability given chunks can always be  retrieved via commit history secondly some application level objects like answer or criterion are used to create corresponding instances as opposed to mocks it would be better if the authors either used mocks or provided the reasoning for this decision

problem the sections included for this design document cover the intent of the group to find and solve the bugs required for their project i am not sure that the introduction section reads as an introduction but more as a project problem statement if this is an introduction more should be included as to what is the purpose of the project and what this current introduction content means
problem the section is included by the content is empty simply listing steps in how you plan to test for correctness of your model additional would work here
problem the search properties and addition of potential buyers needed to be improved and fixed after the first round the authors fixed all of it for round 2 the system works exactly how it is supposed to work i could not find any functionalities that are still failing they have added additional features like signing up with google and sending replies to enquiries via email

problem the schema rb file should be in the repo from the models and the migrations the relationships appeared to be correct
problem the role switch option between realtor and househunter  is not present further the operation cannot be performed manually also as same mail id cannot be used for creating two accounts
problem the reuse of the questionaire class is smart to reduce duplication otherwise the minimal explanations make it hard to judge
problem the result of edge cases are 1 the admin cannot delete real companies with realtors and house hunters 2 the realtor can change real estate company they ill be prohibited though from viewing previous company listings 3 the house hunter account along with their inquiries are removed from the system 4 the realtor account links to a real estate company with 1 to n mapping

problem the relevant parts in the design doc include the listing of files that will be modified description of offscreencanvascontextrendering2d and apis that need to be implemented for this class as stated the team is planning to use the implementation of htmlcanvascontextrendering2d i would suggest to elaborate on how offscreencanvascontextrendering2d differs from htmlcanvascontextrendering2d and provide a better feeling for the reader of how significant those differences are

problem the relationships between inquiries and house house and company potential users and house are absent
problem the relationships are maintained in the schema but the relationship among company realtor seems to be missing as it shows relationship between users and company so the role isnt clear
problem the relationship mapping was appropriate and worked as intended the database unfortunately didn t implement all the necessary features required for the submission for example list of potential buyers

problem the realtor cannot select an existing company and cannot see the list of the companies house hunter  cannot see companies

problem the readme md file has not been updated hence it does not provide the instructions regarding this system it does not mention how the system handles the edge cases since there is no heroku link given i cannot test the system for edge cases and also the readme md file does not specify any details
problem the readme md  does not  cover how the system handles edge cases what will happen if the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses system deletes the realestate company but the app crashes when accessing the realtor account what will happen if a realtor changes his her real estate company will s he be prohibited to remove the houses s he listed in the previous company there is no validation at all and there is no way to have a realtor without a company if this house hunter is a potential buyer of a house will s he be removed from the corresponding potential buyers list app crashes

problem the readme seems incomplete a lot of information could  have been communicated through readme   as an admin i couldn t delete any of the listed houses or companies which i think should be allowed for the admin
problem the readme is very helpful in guiding through the application most of the cases have  not been handled by the application there is no functionality to upload picture to the houses   a new house hunter is able to see all the inquires made by all the house hunters which is not as per the application design
problem the readme is empty and does not contain the admin account information it s hard to navigate around the interface and determine where all the functionality is

problem the readme file isn t as descriptive as it should be and ui is not very well designed printing hello world on the home page seems to be a debugging strategy but it needs to be removed and proper links needs to be inserted example link of logout is not present
problem the readme file is very helpful and facilitates usage of the application there are few issues which can still be resolved such as the navigation issue still persists for example if a house hunter wants to cancel the inquiry there is no way to do that the user would be toggling between the inquiry index page and the inquiry submit page the validations have still not been addressed for example an inquiry can be created without adding any details at all with all empty fields if the house hunter tries to switch to the realtor view the application breaks as below we re sorry but something went wrong   if you are the application owner check the logs for more information
problem the readme file is still the default provided by rails i don t have access to an admin login and when i try to sign up for a new account realtor or hunter i get redirected to a webpage telling me that something went wrong the small ammount of the ui that does exist login and create account seems easy enough to understand but it appears that without logging in i cannot see any other links

problem the readme file does not specify any information about how edge cases are handled but the edge cases were properly handled when the real estate company was deleted all the houses and realtors under it were also deleted however the role switch option between realtor and househunter  is not available further this operation cannot be performed manually also as the code resticts  a mail id from being used for two accounts

problem the pull request was not updated in fact i can t see any of the changes in the linked repo
problem the pull request that the authors have submitted does not pass the travis bot builds but the bot has failed in the tests for which the authors haven t changed any code so overall the pull request doesn t seem to break any code
problem the pull request still shows that the build fails on observing the logs there is only one build job which fails due to a actionnotfound error for view_action method this needs to be looked at

problem the proposed solution  sounds good they haven t really mentioned  the changes in turn of programmer language i couldn t visualize how are they going to make changes they have mentioned few  html erb file but i think they would need put a good amount of work to implement the new feature i think the team could have been more precise in their approach for example they could have included what all new methods they need to add or modify the existing one

problem the proposed refactoring changes seem to follow good ruby principles and also looks dry   they haven t mentioned any pattern as such but overall the design document looks neat and very well written
problem the proposed design seems reasonable before proceeding with the project team should also look at other references to those functions and do it accordingly
problem the proposed design looks fine for now but more details are required in order to make a better judgement so i think that more effort should be expended
problem the proposed changes sounds good to me but as i mentioned screenshots help in a better understanding of the problem statement moreover a more detailed doc would have been better
problem the proposed changes section of the wikipedia clearly mentions the column names the team would implement sort on but how they want to implement the sort could be explained a little more in detail they mention they would use tablesorter jquery but i would suggest to add some sort of a pseudocode that would explain better how exactly does the sorting work

problem the project purpose seems to be only a user story that says what s the deficiencies of te corrent  issues and a terse solution i wonder if that s comprehensive enough i would add some more details in terms of the purpose of each function being changed  in a lower level   there only a high level solution and which files to change  for the project design they are not detailed enough i would add some more plans in terms of how to make the change when to do the change if the changes are inter dependent there s no testing plans yet but i think that should be stated

problem the project purpose is stated but not extremely clearly it seems that in the introduction part there s just copy pasted messages from the question statement the flowchart in the introduction part is good but where should this checkbox be implemented it seems that here it should only be implemented in the instructor administrator end instead of students end but that s not clearly stated in the project purpose part the project design is also not very detailed the title do some changes doesn t seems to be very serious but apart from that the implementation details are also copy pasted from the online project requirements the two picture of before and after illustration looks nice enough it s good that the team has found some extra sources that would allow them to get this before and after picture   the testing plan is not stated at all
problem the project purpose is stated in detail in the introduction part starting from the background and problem statement to improve the quality of report views the purpose is stated in five different small goals separately make changes in view submissions view scores view review report author feedback report and teammate review report five different parts in terms of project purpose it s comprehensive and detailed as for project design it is carefully outlined in the solution and modification of files part i think the project design might needs a bit more description in terms of what steps needs to do first and what steps needs to be done next it seems that all the changes are for the ui but is there any ui that can be served as a pattern for the usage of others or is there any implementation of one ui dependent on the implementation of another here i think there needs to be more detailed steps the testing plan includes detailed steps in terms of how to test the implementation as a  end user i like it very much because it is both succinct and very intuitive it will be good to add some sample pictures when the project is over and some pictures that display the functionality becomes available

problem the project is almost on the stage that it can be deployed on the production server however there are few test cases that are failing as shown on the git if these minor flaws are fixed then the code is good to go
problem the project is about adding tests to the a model so this is okay but there is not sufficient background on the model itself more details would be good for the uninitiated   also they mention that the number of tests for the model were not sufficient it would have been better if they would have quoted the code coverage numbers before and after
problem the project includes the problem statement the team has described the problem statement in detail and has also provided visual aids however the team could have also included the way in which they implement these changes
problem the project has successfully named it s varables and function names according to the principle they are understandable form what the mean but the project lacks any documentation internally as well as a proper external readme file lack of code documentation makes it tough for the reviewer to make sense of the code apart from that the design of the database schema isn t normalized to much extent which makes data entries redundant

problem the project covers a significant part of the functionality for testing the participant however the biggest problem is that the scores method is commented out from the class assignmentparticipant obviously this will break the existing code that relies on that functionality furthermore the future testing will possibly become complicated because the object under test for participant_spec rb is an instance of assignmentparticipant as opposed to participant

problem the project consists of making a search function to select specific users assignments etc using some criteria so they re creating a search functionality for individual models
problem the project consists of five independent problems the scope of which is well defined in the design document the team provides visual diagrams in the solution descriptions which further improve the explanations of changes the fix for the issue 1008 issue related to staggered deadline is backed up by a discussion about relevant db tables and corresponding part of code one minor improvement would be for the authors to highlight the specific parts of code that are going to be changed in the updated block of code moreover the solution to the issue 1072 issue related to instructor s assignment participation is not specific enough i e it is not clear which structures are going to be affected by the changes all in all the document does a great job in explaining what changes are going to be introduced in the system

problem the newly added code includes the attribute height the getcontext and transfertoimagebitmap method in the offscreencanvas webidl file the name height given for the attribute height for the canvas makes complete sense similarly the name getcontext given for the method that returns the offscreenrenderingcontext is also intuitive the name transfertoimagebitmap is a little long which might be the code less readable if the method is called often instead the accessor convention of using getimagebitmap feels more intuitive and also logical at the same time
problem the newly added code has not yet been accepted in the pull request but it does build the corresponding rust implementation however has not been added and so the test coverage hasn t improved by much
problem the newly added code does not resolve the previous issues to great extent
problem the new design seems to violate the dry principle copying an entire class and then editing it will likely cause problems as you will be using code you did not write and so will not understand as well as your own code this is probably still a better design decision than writing the offscreen canvas from scratch however since it will take less time could you use delegation or extension to dry out the implementation

problem the manual tests listed should adequately test the functionality but information should be provided on automated testing
problem the main thread behind the design seems to be reusing the existing code which provides the similar functionality this is a great idea it is consistent with the appropriate programming principles e g not reinventing the wheel one suggestion would be for the authors to explain why the instance of the class from which the relevant parts of code are going to be copied is not directly used as  this would be a more dry approach in a case if this is not possible then providing a proper reasoning and justification would be helpful
problem the login page is not made all the admins information is listed on the first page which should not be allowed it was difficult to understand if i was under the admin s page realtor s or hunter s page
problem the login opens the user page which has which has 5 back links for some reason and they do not do anything no common home page for all the list views have to all the list views go from user pages list of companies is not in tabulated form thus very difficult to read
problem the login and sign up page work as expected but the following have changes to be implemented the view is poorly developed admin login credentials are not mentioned so could not test the admin functionality validation for phone number and email id has not been done the system accepts a number which has less than 10 digits and an invalid email id creation of a new house is inside inquiries tab under realtors page which is misleading not able to associate a realtor with a company hence not able to validate the update and delete functionality of a company from inside the realtors page   not able to switch between realtor and house hunter if an user is both delete and update functionalities have not been implemented inquiry creation from house hunter page is not implemented
problem the login signup module seems to be well tested of all the other models and controllers in the program but this module has a drawback it deals with three tables the realtors the househunters and the admin due to this kind of segmentation there is a repetition of data i the database if any user would like to signup as both also it would make it difficult to handle complexity as the application grows according to me its better to atleast cascade the tables of realtors and house hunters into one   the other functionalities are not wholly implemented only the crud operations related to those are implemented hence not much could be reviewed about testing

problem the login signup module has lots of bugs like when a user tries to create an account with an already existing username the application crashes also a user cannot signup as both a realtor and a househunter moreover there isnt any validtion for the length of phone number nor the validation for the email address is correct for example it accepts aa a as a valid email address so yes these functionalities in the login signup module could be improved and these does not seem thoroughly tested but the search functionality for the houses seemed to work pretty well and as expected
problem the logic showed in the design is clear and easy enough but the deign lacks essential details for dealing with reviews
problem the logic in the code looks proper still the code itself is hard to follow primarily because a lot of functionality has been added in a method whose name suggests only partial functionality and no comments have added anywhere examples are in applicatins_controller rb the methods get_realtor_nav_bar and get_hoousehunter_nav_bar make sql queries and other functionalities in houses_controller rb the show method also has a lot code that ideally should not belong in that method i would suggest to put such code in different methods or name the method better do not shy away from creating 10 different methods if need be it organises code much better and simpler to understand

problem the high level design which is needed to start with the work looks prominent as the project proceeds few intricacies resulting due to design conflicts scalability need to be addressed as and when required but the team has laid out a solid foundation to begin with
problem the high level view of the solution appears to be reasonable the problem with this design is that there is no discussion present about any principles or patterns that are going to be utilized as part of the solution i would suggest using certain keywords to make the decisions more clear to the reader for example the authors talk about reusing the code of htmlcanvascontextrendering2d and webglrenderingcontext it would be helpful if the concrete mechanism were specified for example patterns like decorator or adapter would be relevant for this case

problem the explanation is quite good to tell what is the current and the required functionality the screenshots placed are not complete as in they cut the code at the right end instead i would suggest to placed the github link to the code changes so that the wiki becomes shorter and you can explain each code change better in the wiki also the reviewer can compare the code with your explanation properly if he has the link to the code
problem the explanation is inadequate needs more textual explanation of the problem and approach

problem the explanation is good the images are very large on the screen and it is hard to spot the changes that you made consider highlighting the changes to show them better
problem the explanation is good and they have managed to get in a prototype ui as well my only concern with the design is if there are a lot of assignments the page might become very wide and will require a horizontal scroll bar to access all the data for the user
problem the explanation is descriptive and explains the logic behind the solution which is think should work however i believe that team should can add the explanation about the files and classes they tend to make changes in the team can now focus on implementation of the code
problem the explanation is clear it would be better if the authors explain more about the strategy pattern they will use

problem the explanation given by the authors was pretty straightforward looking at the explanations it looks like the authors have thought about different aspects of the problem statement and also of different ways to implement the github metrics integration feature along with the side effects of implementing it in a particular way e g one would think that adding the metrics to the database would be a sound solution but given the nature of an open source project and the fact that students would commit beyond the deadline the authors have thought not to add the metrics to the database which is sound and reasonable

problem the document should expand on the design and make specific assertions about how the changes will be propagated so far the idea behind the design is to utilize an existing code of htmlcanvascontextrendering2d adding new functionality like blob api on top of that one suggestion would be to elaborate on that and discuss how the new  functionality  will be merged with existing code what patterns might be used to increase the efficacy and simplicity of the system

problem the  document covers a number of important topics including the description of servo apis and concepts that are going to be used by the team in this project problem statement project build and proposed design however the testing plan is not discussed while the instances of testing is certainly mentioned in the document e g specific functionalities could be tested by writing a custom html file and then running it the similar way and finally we  ll test our code by enabling the blob api the authors do not provide an extensive discussion of specifically what functionality is going to be tested i would suggest reducing the overall size of the initial sections which  provide an overview of servo project off screen canvas web workers and web idl they introduce more verbosity to the  document than necessary two or three descriptive sentences could be used instead the reader could refer to  a more detailed information through references furthermore the focus of the problem statement falls on the description of the offscreencanvas api making it somewhat redundant it would be better to emphasize on flashing out the goal of the project and only later provide the reference to the technical details if necessary another suggestion would be for the team to identify and elaborate on the changes that are going to be merged in servo
problem the document contains a uml use case diagram that analyze the system s requirements and describes the actors involved and the relationship between them it helps to understand the overview of the project details however it can certainly make use of a flow diagram in the expected flow section that gives more clarity about the sequence of actions the flow diagram can follow from the use case diagram to show the tasks performed by the actors in a serial order

problem the design proposed by the team specifies an addition of a new button to the buttons tray from the existing ui the button when clicked must bring a menu of additional reports this functionality should consider the mapping to the review_mapping controller file that will implement the given features
problem the design proposed by the team looks complex in terms of the functionalities desired they must backup these changes by providing a pictorial representation of the task like the one described in the documentation this can help to understand the project in a better way

problem the design plan portion feels a bit lacking i found myself wanting more detail about how and what they were going to copy between each implementation and the next what s going to be filtered out what s going to be added i have no clue
problem the design looks solid but it s hard to tell without sufficient detail if anything causing every static string reference to be encapsulated into an object that uses the current language to return the correct string is more dry and maintainable than what we have now i wonder if dynamic translation gems are out there or would work the claim that dynamic translation should not be done in this project should be defended e g it would take too much time

problem the design looks good enough it mostly deals with html erb files to accommodate the graph and some database filtering in the controllers i do not think that the design will increase the responses time of the system suggestion if the details regarding how the graph will be implemented or any gem will be used should have been given i did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality that too would have been useful
problem the design looks a bit complicated and will increase the response time of the system it can make the code smelly too complicated code handled in issue 1 which could be refactored
problem the design lacks dynamic paging for different users all the links are visible to all the users and upon clicking the links an error comes that you are not authorized to perform the action ideally only relevant links should be visible to the user it confuses the user regaring the actions he she can perform the user needs to perform all the actions visible in the ui to know what are the actions relevant for him her the readme file also is not well described about the actions that can be performed by the user the readme file currently lacks any relevant information
problem the design lacks diagrams to state what the changes they will do and how it will be like after change it is difficult to image how the system will be like after change and what will be changed

problem the design doc outlines each step that needs to be implemented and a simple implementation plan
problem the design doc looks more or less complete given that it is just phase one of the project i feel that some screenshots and a more detailed explanation would have been better

problem the design doc contains project purpose project design and testing plan in the wiki the wiki contains mock visualizations which make it easy to understand the project proposal and how are they planning to do the design flow as a flow chart adds to the ease of understanding the test plan explains about the technologies that they are planning to use for testing suggestion   the test plan could say what should be done in testing than just the technologies to be used for a particular part of code for ed we plan to have a dummy small data and see if the graphs output the visualizations correctly if the sum id being counted to 100 of the class participation etc the stacked version could also have been represented for better understanding

problem the design changes appear simple and clear only suggestion to the team would be to explain the design choices a little more as mentioned above give an example of how where to use bootstrap and jumbotron
problem the design appears to be specific to the requirements for this they have used a uml design which basically explains the flow of the use case they have not used any principles or design patterns however there does not seem a need to use any as their changes are limited to the html view and making a call to the tablesorter using jquery as per the document the design does not make any redundant changes or unnecessary changes to the code thus they have done a good job by optimizing the changes
problem the design appears to be sound for most part of it the linking between the different sections seems appropriate the only issue i have is with the mock up in the design details second change mock up number 2 i think that the bar chart is being displayed for each and every day i feel that is not only highly unnecessary but also would be very overwhelming for the instructor to process all this information because i it is common knowledge that many students do not begin projects until a few days weeks would have passed since the assignment is posted so that would leave the initial few days of the bar chart empty with nothing valuable to show ii the duration of each project varies from project to project assignment 2 had a duration of about 20 30 days this would mean that there would be about 20 bar charts for each day which would be quite difficult for the ta instructor to process for just one team let alone for so many other teams they need to evaluate suggestions instead of providing bar chart for each day aggregate it to a bar chart for each week or one in 5 days and then maybe towards the deadline or like a week before the deadline you could switch to 1 barchart per day or provide an option to switch between the scaling of time periods like a week 5 days 1 day etc

problem the db design is incomplete although it has the correct 1 to n or n to n relationship it doesn t have any kings of validation
problem the database schema especially for the login signup functionality is very well implemented and includes lots of features that weren t asked for at the first place so the extra hard work is very well appreciated the db design is very cohesive and seems fool proof the rest of the programs and the functionalities follow most of the principles for good ruby on rails coding practices but the one thing i find missing was the lack of proper documentation within the code given the short time frame not having extensive documentation and comments within the code is excusable but there were certain points where i had to go through the whole code to realize what s happening which could have been avoided if there was proper commenting inside the code
problem the database schema only consisted of the users table and the crud functionalities on the mvc related to it due to the less amount of content to review a proper justification for this question is a bit tough even though the amount of code was less but it followed many of the good coding practices of ruby on rails except a few for example he code lacked any sort of documentation or comments it makes it tough for the reviewer or any other programmer to make sense of the code but apart from that the practices seemed fine the variables were named appropriately functions were named effectively and the classes were defined definitely
problem the database handles all the relationships very well on the downside there is a flaw in database design keeping a single user table and single role type means the same email address can not be used for both realtor and house hunter profiles you can either create separate tables or more than one columns to determine if  the same email has more than one role
problem the current tests written are good but it would be good if the team had pointed out the corner cases as wel such as what happens if the deadline for self review is exceeded does that mean the peer review scores cannot be seen or is a default score of 0 is set

problem the coverage has increased from 77 to 94 which is impressive however the previous issue was that scores method of  participant was not called because the object  that is being tested in this project is an instance  of assignmentparticipant class this problem was handled by commenting out the scores method of assignmentparticipant so that participant scores method will be called instead   this  breaks other parts of the  code which depend on assignmentparticipant s scores implementation the solution to this problem is to either define a new participant class instance in the factory or to define it in the test code itself

problem the code is clean and easy to follow and each method handles one task i could not understand the reason for some of the code like the home action in the hunters_controller the current user s role is set to 3 without any checks so if the url  is visited directly and user s role is something else it will be set to 3 and saved which can result in wrong behaviours overall code is well written

problem the code follows the common ruby on rails application structure hence it was easy for me to navigate through other files to see portion of the code it follows the common mvc structure however in some parts of the code comments were missing which was confusing as i didn t understand the logic for that code readme file was not properly described for other users navigating through app
problem the code follows ruby and rails convention but there are  multiple commented files in the project such as logins coffee and many more which have not been used in the application
problem the code follows on the lines of good ruby on rails practices however i can see no migrations in the db folder the readme file contains sql statements for table completion which look to be correct

problem the code follows good coding style adheres to naming standards and is dry however the suggested changes since last round have not been implemented which emphasized on shortening the length of long functions create and view
problem the code enables properly testing the various features and describes the system working as desired however since the travis build did not pass the code could be deployed but with careful intervention by the developer it could be taken up from here and does not require to be redone from scratch
problem the code employed good naming and seemed to be dry and follow standard ruby on rails practices the methods were kept short houseinterestlist would make more sense as houseinterest each row in the table is one wish list entry not a list of wish list entries
problem the code does its functionality but it s not tested   my biggest concern would be to have the test cases written for it before the production version   it is a good starting place for a future team to pick up and just cover the test cases

problem the code contributed does not follow the test rule in that the tests are made using create instead of build the code functions do not implement much function and does not follow the ruby style guide the team should focus on getting the tests running by following the dry principle
problem the code contributed by the author contains long functions which are adequate and consistent considering the amount of task that is carried by each function the team could improve upon the comments to enable high understanding of the flow of code written the code does follow the ruby style guide and supports the dry principle

problem the code consists of small methods that mostly test one thing this results in high readability the team has made an extensive use of context constructs which further enhance the code documentation moreover the team has improved the sort_by_name method making it cleaner and easier to follow this was  complemented by the fix of bad  names that  were present  in the first round e g stu1 p1 etc one suggestion pertaining to the scores block would be to use specific assertions of fields instead of testing the object via inspect method and comparing it to the string value
problem the code changes in app controllers submitted_content_controller rb line 60 78 could have been in a separate method such as send email to reviewers that would make the controller code clean and clear     code changes does not follow  the dry principle in atleast two places 1   in  app mailers delayed_mailer rb there is no need to duplicate the code the code in the new method   review_reminder_email   has been copied from  email_reminder   the  email_reminder  method can be used instead of creating a separate method altogether   2   app models assignment_participant rb  and  app models course_participant rb  uses a  same code to send the emails via  mailerhelper send_mail_to_user  that can be put in one place so that it can be reused in both the places
problem the code changes are very less so not much to say about refactoring dry problems etc the code has put statements which are also pointed out by the code climate bot having put conditions is not a good coding style the authors could have considered to remove the statements puts hi im in import puts name to_s the authors could have debugged to see the flow of code or remove them before committing

problem the code changes are accepted but build does not pass travis ci the problem statement is simple and team has implemented a clean solution for the same
problem the code can definitely be deployed but once the 3 pending code climate issues i believe  the 3 are to be resolved by he mentor and the travis ci build have been rectified suggestion rectify the travis ci issues

problem the code can be readily merged into production 1 i felt code climate failing not an issue because their similar blocks of code were on spec files and deleting 2 different roles is the same functionality in the end few places has indentation errors which can be fixed before merging as suggested earlier removing the error for sql and replacing with some form of alert box could be helpful for a future work
problem the code can be deployed once the travis ci passes and there are some 6 minor warnings to be fixed in code climate there are 4 failing and 1 successful checks the team needs to make sure these checks pass in order to be able deploy the code onto the production server
problem the code build passes the travis ci test and it has not  conflicts with the base branch however the team should resolve warnings

problem the authors have considered various preconditions but edge cases are not tested no test plan has been provided some tests have been edited to meet the new requirements many conditions have been checked using if else cases which could have been more elegant
problem the authors have considered the requirements and accordingly designed their solutions the proposed ui design looks very intuitive and the abstract understanding of the code seems to good however the implementation is required to say definitely if it makes the code smelly
problem the authors have adequately explained the changes made to the system ot would have been better if some visual modes are added
problem the authors have added the screenshots from github which clearly shows the code change but since there are many changes the explanation in the wiki is small a better way would have been to put the links to the git files where the changes are made and there could be more explanations instead this would also reduce the size of the wiki

problem the authors do a great job of explaining the technical details and the api functionality of the requirements furthermore they provide a list of files that are going to be changed in the scope of this project however the document would be more complete if the authors provided more details about specifics of changes for example the description of high level changes pertaining to the offscreencanvascontextrendering2d is adequate but it would be better if the authors elaborated on the code that is going to be filtered out

problem the application has really come a long way from the previous submission i believe most of the page routes follow an appropriate application flow there are several of the dependencies that are evidently not implemented do to the following observations 1   users are able to assign him herself a real estate company that doesn t exist in the system this assignment should only be made with existing companies to fulfill the requirement of mapping a realtor to a single company this missing dependency also reflects in the creation of houses realtors are able to create houses that are not listed with the company that the realtor is associated with this association should be automatically made according to the company assigned to the realtor 2 users can be both a hunter and a realtor at the same time and can switch back and forth how do you differentiate between a users abilities probably the best option would be to only allow users to be either a house hunter or a realtor that would eliminate some of the ambiguities is associations and some unnecessary profile fields like house hunters having a real estate company 3 inquiries are not associated with houses this posses an issue with knowing what property the house hunter is requesting information about overall there have been great advances in your application since the first submit continue implementing those dependencies so that the required associations can hold

problem system works well except for the sign up feature
problem suggested changes related to naming convention are not included in the 2nd round   variable names rop_topic_deadline1 topic_id1 puts statements are not removed p topic_id1   other than this the code is properly written following coding best practices
problem success in edge case testing is determined by the association of the module to self or with other modules many edge cases in this application are dependent on relationships between modules for example because houses are not properly associated with realtors or companies reassigning a realtor s company appears to have no affect administrators are not able to  delete users or companies but  i would image it would not throw an error there are cases that i tested that dealt specifically around the models example user accounts can be created with the same email accounts as long as they are of different user types   this and other edge cases of it type proved successful it would be great to have edge case information listed in the readme to clarify how these cases were dealt with again implementing the necessary dependencies between models will help to eliminate many of these edge case issues

problem scenarios that are discussed in the wiki have comprehensive descriptions and justifications however clearly a number of edge cases are not considered as the test coverage is 77   i would suggest using mock objects which will both decouple tests from database and increase the overall coverage   for example mocking find_by method of teamsuser would allow covering participant team case allow teamsuser to receive find_by with user student and_return team   another minor issue is that wiki is missing some cases that are implemented in the code team fullname scores

problem overall the code is very well written and follows all the best coding practices but what i feel is a few more comments could help in improving the readability of the code also there were few console debug statements which were causing the code climate checks to fails these could be removed or logged into rails log

problem overall this was a usable system however this app did not do a good job of keeping track of my session once i edited that admin account i could not navigate via links to the home page and was also asked to sign in again if i clicked admin sign in even if i signed up as a different user my admin account was still signed into i also was not logged in upon signing up as a realtor or house hunter   some other comments are an admin should be able to set the password for realtor or house hunter that is a security vulnerability   when i tried to use the reset password link i get an error when creating a house as an admin i shouldn t have to know the id of the company i should be provided a drop down of existing companies the same way for how a realtor chooses a company to join asking a realtor to choose or create a company before signing up is another security vulnerability  you leak the existing companies and allow someone who isn t a user of your system to create a company the inquiry and interest flow in this application is really well done

problem one major problem is that  i am getting an error after adding a house as a realtor which prevents access to realtor house related features like edit destroy etc admin credentials are not specified in the readme i managed to  find them in the seeds rb file   most of the admin functionality is implemented however i  am getting an error when accessing new house page   https rocky sands 72044 herokuapp com houses new and so house cannot be added through admin same case with  realtor houses data is missing  in the system search functionality is present in the code however i was not able to locate the proper view for that

problem once travis build passes the project could be merged i have seen specs in the existing code base that are very implementation dependent so this won t be an issue
problem once the issues with pull request are fixed it can be merged
problem once any user signs in he she cannot log out this is a major flaw in the workflow
problem on checking the code we find that in agreement with travisbuddy the code had a build error which seems to be unresolved which is strange and should have been looked into moreover the overall coverage shows a good amount of increase which is good but one must say that the details in the code changes as few as they seem have been to a good extent for the majority of the part and thus worth the merit

problem on checking the videos the functionality seems to be working fine i haven t been able to manually test it
problem on checking the pull request it shows the travis ci check has failed
problem of the functionality the team have tried to to implement the code quality is not poor however the arrangement of code is difficult to understand given that not all functionalities seem to have been implemented the def after_sign_in_path_for function in the applications controller used by the devise gem only takes realtor as a resource i would advise using an if or case condition within the function to allow other users to login also i was unable to find any implementation for making sure that only the inquiries specific to a real estate company be visible to a realtor and similarly only the inquiries posted by a house hunter themselves be visible to the house hunter on that specific house i would again suggest using some if or case statements in the show function of the inquiries controller to establish identity of current_user

problem not only does the build fail with multiple errors the overall coverage is shows a significant decrease instead of an increase which is a real cause of concern moreover the number of commits even though impressive does include a lot of minimalistic changes which one does beg to question the necessity of but that s still fine since i am assuming that the complexity of the code may require so many commits but still adding a line break as a commit i am unsure if its a great way to go about it

problem nope they have errors in their build too as indicated by travis ci and this is the error message output by it   hey  ppvasude something went wrong with the build travisci finished with status  errored which means the build failed because of something unrelated to the tests such as a problem with a dependency or the build process itself on checking the build logs i found that they errors in bundle install stage itself resulting from missing gems which they haven t resolved as a part of second submission

problem nope the last commit still shows from 12 days ago which is the time period even before the first submission overall the branch is 3 commits ahead and 20 commits behind the expertiza master even so conclusively going by their git hub their last commit was before the first submission and hence no commits in the second submission
problem nope again they did not mention a lot about how they test but what they have done
problem none of the tests travis ci code climate have passed
problem none of the relationships are handled with the built in has_one has_many or belongs_to functionality except the user model which randomly belongs_to realestate
problem none of the models specify any belongs_to or has_many relationship and no migrate nor schema stores an official reference to be used
problem none of the functions are too long could find changes where dry principle was violated the code follows ruby convention and guidelines although the code is easy to follow the team needs to add comments for the changes which is currently missing good job

problem no this is not standards to add colors in the respective element it becomes very hard to maintain or modify such changes in future it would be better to move the style to a scss file and use a class ui to make this change which is clean and dry
problem no they were no commits during round 2

problem no i do not think the code is ready to be deployed i found the code change hard to understand there are no comments and neither has the logic or rationale behind the new changed code been given in the wiki besides the build fails and there are a host of issues that  need to be fixed   although all this might only be trivial issues and can be fixed rather easily the code as of now is not deployment ready  according to me

problem no the team hasn t committed  any changes during the second round the last commit was on 31st october 2018
problem no the team has not been diligent in specially making a section of what it does as the introductory section of the doc so as to make us understand the goals of the project they have seemed to not even make a wiki page for the same or have seemed to forget to upload it because how am i supposed to follow the approach and solution of the problem if there doesn t exist any documentation to check for the same
problem no the team has not been diligent in specially making a section of what it does as the introductory section of the doc so as to make us understand the goals of the project they have just copy pasted the problem statement on the wiki page in a single paragraph even that statement seems to have been incompletely pasted in just a single paragraph so it highly unclear what they are doing i had to open the projects assignment doc of the professor to try to make sense out of the motivation of the problem
problem no the team did not add any test cases and the coverage did not increase the overall decrease was 13 6 to 34 007
problem no the strange part is the code hasn t been committed during the second round it is strange because they have surely seem to have achieved all their requirements to problems going by the wiki page so why haven t they committed the new changes is the question
problem no the readme file tells me what i should do to test in local computer and does not offer admin s information or any instruction of how to operate when login to the website

problem no the build did not pass in travis ci several checks had failed but there was no conflict
problem no the authors didn t improve the code
problem no that doesn t seem to be the case since it has been a very jumpy approach and also the functionality of only a basic login has been added so if adding the bare login and sign up is considered as an mvc architecture then they have surely built a bare backbone of it

problem no testing is not covered yet
problem no since no write up or no wiki page exists it is clearly not possible to ascertain any of the above clauses
problem no one of the functionalities of the test plan is not yet done
problem no not really the website just has one role to operate and the readme file is an auto generated file which doesn t include any useful information
problem no not really no user type has all the functionality in this review s check boxes much less all the functionality specified in the project description manual inspection of the test folder reveals that all the model and controller tests are empty as are the fixtures
problem no not really first of all   i still cannot login in as admin according to the account and password offered in readme file so i cannot see what could happen when i log in as an admin even though a hunter can put an inquiry for a house but the realtor are not able to reply it however compared to the commitment in round 1 they have made a lot of improvements but the admin part is still falling
problem no not really the design is does not implement the test plan but rather goes on to show how the pre existing expertiza algorithm works so it would help if they showed the same

problem nicely implemented code used ruby delegations appropriately and the code is very readable   however a few things can be improved   for eg in inquiriy_replies_controller flash is used to transfer data from the new method to the params method which is not the correct way also i believe that the implementation can be made more efficient by reducing the number of database hits for example in almost all the controllers there are redundant database hits   user find session id role_type buyer could have been identified during login a second hit to identify the role type or any such info can be avoided for a small test database this would not show any performance decrease but as the records increase the pages will become exponentially slower     maybe you can store these in memory session which would reduce time taken significantly at a small memory overhead

problem naming looks fine could probably have used  is_submitted instead of is_submitted
problem naming is good there are few names eg is_selfreview_enabled which don t seem fine but they were from before any thing new that has been added by them follows proper naming convention
problem names could have been better designed especially the quesparams variable i get no idea about what that variable is used for or what that implements you can rename it to question_params or duplicate_directory_params etc
problem n link to the deployed version is provided hence cannot comment on this question
problem multiple success message still not fixed
problem multiple roles seems to be missing eg for the details for house hunter given in readme i get logged into realtor profile same is when  i create a new user and log in  create a company get message that user has been created welcome to the real estate manager hunter  user was successfully created
problem multiple controllers are thoroughly tested but no models appear to be properly tested

problem most of the naming is reasonable and follows standard ruby practices   one problem is that code makes extensive use of variable names concatenated with numbers example allow participant3 to receive topic and_return topic here it is not clear what distinguishes participant3 from other participants and why it is special it would be better to avoid using contractions such as stu1 or p1 sort_by_name method line 130 furthermore i would suggest using consistent  indentation  for example get_authorization method line 113

problem most functionalities are working great in the first round admin was missing some basic functionalities now they are present and working one issue that i came across is that while admin is creating a new company the system keeps raising an error saying that the website url is invalid and so the users cannot create new company maybe there is something wrong with the validations of company model however when realtor creates the company this error does not occur
problem most commits were done by one person which  cannot be considered a good practice naming  of commits is done well names are descriptive of  the introduced changes i would suggest  doing commits more often by dividing work into smaller chunks
problem most basic functionalities are working admin functions of add delete users is now working well one issue that i faced realtor view house listings button not working so most of the realtor functionalities as they are dependent on houses are not working

problem it seems that some of the associations were attempted 1 real estate company contains many users and houses and 2 house belongs to a real estate company and a user these relationships are currently commented out so the dependencies are not enforced there are additional connections missing such as the users model where a realtor should belong to only a single company and many houses the implementation seems incomplete but the idea found within the company and house models is moving in the right direction
problem it seems that everything works though it was hard confusing to find everything as per the instructions on the write up

problem it seems not working properly when logged in as a realtor click on the view inquiry will jump to the house page
problem it seems like almost all changes were made on one day for part 2 of the project
problem it seems evident that there are deletion issues for any resource user that is already indexed on some other resource user the solution to that issue would be    adding a destroy dependency in model files for example for house hunters   has_many  inquiries   dependent destroy
problem it seems as though you have an awful lot of controllers that are supposed to have something to do with authentication that either don t get used or don t have any code in them other than that the project looks organized like a ruby on rails project should be there is a lot of code that is hard to follow and i can t discern its purpose in several controllers

problem it is surely a very intuitive user interface because the ease of navigation is generally very well defined and the routes rb file in git hub makes the session linkage explicit   even so one does fail to understand the empty blanks on their login page since there aren t any blanks at all so we get easily confused on what to do sign up is not validated for any functionality be it user or admin or realtor and we don t know what to do   luckily the readme file does resolve the dilemma and help us to follow the steps
problem it is pending while i am doing this review when i click on it it did not pass travis ci but it fails on tests on features while this group is testing participant it happened to our group as well i assume it is not an issue with their code

problem it is not a very intuitive user interface because the ease of navigation not achieved in it due to the ill defined db folders and the routes rb file in git hub makes the session linkage a bit hard to follow   also i fail to understand the structural flow of the program even after logging in after signing up so i get easily confused on what to do sign up is not validated for any functionality be it user or admin or realtor and we don t know what to do and that are we admins or any other user privilege separation has not been done also the readme barely resolve the dilemma and is of minimal help to us to follow the steps

problem it is given in wiki that most of your test cases depend on checking the output however like i mentioned in my last review several test cases like the ones mentioned below can be automated this is especially true as tdd is explicitly mentioned in your problem statement write the required tests before implementing refactoring the methods in the above mentioned classes add past due assignments to the student  s task list on student view check for correction in due dates of assignments when an assignment  s due date is edited it should be appropriately moved from the   past assignments  list to the   current assignments  list if needed on student task page separate the list of teamed with students from the current tasks box

problem it is a testing project which aims at improving test coverage so production deployment is not in question however before merging the code to master branch here are a few recommended changes 1 adding comments to improve readability and understanding for future use 2 avoid using comments like i swear this is the last one they do not explain anything about what you changed from your last commit and why proper professional comments are expected all these comments should be refactored
problem it included a proper test plan there was no test plan included in the previous version of the design document but authors have added it in the second round which made the design document complete
problem it has not been thoroughly tested user house and company models don t have enough validations like valid year phone no should be only numbers creating a company while creating a user doesn t link that company to the user it has to be done manually later

problem issues with the build can be fixed quickly issues seem trivial
problem issues related to not mentioning the functionality of each method have been resolved the wiki now mentions what each method does and what issue does it fix only issue with the current codebase is that it contains very long functions that could have been refactored and broken down the perform function contains a lot of lines and has tons of if else statements
problem issues are fixed but creating house from a realtor account breaks in heroku i am unable to create an account which has same email address for realtor and buyer realtor does not have a choose company input field to choose his realtor company
problem issues 391 1201 were fixed but i dont see any tests as mentioned in issue 1190
problem issues able to create admin accounts view inquiry is failing for househunter no way to see interested house list
problem issue 1065 uml diagram is too high level so it does not provide enough details rest all diagrams follow the standards and are easy to understand
problem issue 1201 in the assignments_controller code the team has checked in a puts statement line 48 which looks like debug code even though these are helpful during the development phase we need to remove them before finally pushing them issue 391 the comment assignments_controller rb 85 is not descriptive enough the author has commented out a method call it would be beneficial to the person reading the code to understand the intention behind this please provide a detailed comment on why this was done again the author has use a puts statement _submitted_files html erb 29 which should not be committed and should only be used during development debugging please remove the debug code
problem issue 1201 below is the change made in _general html erb directory name will be autogenerated if not provided in the form of assignment name_id_course_id the last part could be modified to something with a bit more clarity from the assignments_controller code it could be seen that the auto generated directory name follows the format assignment name _ assignment id _ course_id which is not what is specified in the text there is a typo in the word autogenerated it needs to be hyphenated as auto generated

noproblem of what code is available in the zip file most of it is understandable the devise gem seems unnecessary to their implementation however
noproblem github link is not submitted i downloaded the repo and it has barely 4 commits with basic scaffolds and schema generated for realtors and houses
noproblem the link seems to be a local deployment
noproblem all tests in the zip file are scaffold generated
noproblem yes the house controller has been tested
noproblem no testing has been done apart from the auto generated tests
noproblem the zip posted doesn t seem to be updated again later after 1st oct
noproblem yes the controllers have been properly tested
noproblem there are 24 commits done however all have been made on one day
noproblem there are no proper commit messages
noproblem no i just see all commits happened in one day so i don t think the team has been keeping on pushing their changes
noproblem    no there has been only one commit on 10 01
noproblem all the changes were pushed on a single day the last day of submission
noproblem interface is very basic it lacks in many major functionalities that made the navigation through the site difficult readme was not well described to understand the team s work and their functionalities
noproblem the ruby coding convention has been followed   through out the project
noproblem the mvc structure is good but some details should   be improved
noproblem    yeah in a way the scaffolding generated code follows convention
noproblem the code follows the common ruby on rails application structure hence it was easy for me to navigate through other files to see portion of the code it follows the common mvc structure however in some parts of the code comments were missing which was confusing as i didn t understand the logic for that code readme file was not properly described for other users navigating through app
noproblem the controllers are well written
noproblem the code follows good ruby and rails coding practice from my point of view
noproblem have used dry principles the code has good readability and good naming conventions are followed have grouped similar functionalities into classes so that it is modularized have used iterators such as each instead of for and while
noproblem ui ux is awesome and intuitive read me file is also well described
noproblem the user interface is easy to use and the readme file is explicit
noproblem great ui admin dashboard looks very professional
noproblem yes you have the tests written
noproblem the basics test are written some application specific tests can be written
noproblem requesting to git link to verify the same
noproblem it seems that there is only one team member pushing changes
noproblem the model and controller are well designed each method covers a single functionality good job
noproblem the mvc structure is completed and basic functions have been finished
noproblem the interface is good clean and very easy to use
noproblem they are simple links to pages which does tell you where to go so it s fine
noproblem the ui is elementary but intuitive the links have long descriptive names
noproblem yes it is deployed on heroku
noproblem yes the team seems to have tested their userscontroller completely that handles login logout and other user signin validations
noproblem the code was presumable uploaded in the end pushed from another repo and hence i could not see any regular commits
noproblem in total there are only 3 commits done
noproblem the ruby coding convention has been followed   through out the project
noproblem    yeah in a way the scaffolding generated code follows convention
noproblem no not really the website just has one role to operate and the readme file is an auto generated file which doesn t include any useful information
noproblem yes the controllers have been properly tested
noproblem    there are some tests for the controllers but it looks like just the scaffold generated tests
noproblem only the default testcases created by the command are present in the repository
noproblem there are 24 commits done however all have been made on one day
noproblem    no there has been only one commit on 10 01
noproblem the models views and controllers have been properly designed and implemented
noproblem most of the practices have been followed
noproblem the ruby source code appears to follow ror conventions and uses a few rails associations the directory names and project structure appear to follow good ror mvc conventions source code is organized and uncluttered too
noproblem the code is neat and precise with proper structure and comments
noproblem very good structure readable and names are very relevant to the functionality
noproblem the code is written   really well
noproblem good design and easy to use
noproblem controller has been tested
noproblem extensive testing was done
noproblem yes
noproblem team was active thoughout the process
noproblem no the majority of the work was pushed on 09 29 it is an impressive product if they got all of this done in the past week
noproblem there are many commits which are divided almost equally between all teammmates
noproblem yes about 75   commits were done
noproblem code commit frequency is good
noproblem the code is very well written and arranged to be easily understandable no extraneous code or unused code visible dry principles have been implemented very well
noproblem very clearly code
noproblem this team has followed the basic structure followed in every ruby on rails application which made my task easier to access files and understand their logic properly described readme file and also one additional pdf given with application was enough to give me proper understanding of the modules
noproblem readme file contains enough information to understand the project implementation basics
noproblem please directly tall users where to sign up
noproblem the user interface is very intuitive and easy to use it is very well explained in the readme file the steps to run the code are described as well
noproblem yes the user interface is intuitive and easy to use also the readme file has been perfectly described to give the proper idea of the flow and login credentials of an admin
noproblem basic scaffold generated tests available
noproblem yes from what i could see they have done well in testing at least one model and one controller
noproblem team has perfectly implemented major modules and also they have implemented the extra credit portion i tried to login with invalid credentials or some invalid password email phone lengths but there were validations hence they have perfectly focused on this parts too and tested it    i believe this has implemented a through test of at least one module and controller
noproblem several linear commits with good explanations available
noproblem tem has properly used git and only pushed the changes when necessary and also consistently throughout the project period
noproblem well written code
noproblem not a lot of code to begin with but whatever is there seems by coding practice norms most of the code seems to be commented
noproblem yes the code follows good ruby and rails coding practices as the models views and controllers are well defined
noproblem the interface is preliminary but is easy to understand
noproblem the admin functionality is tested well however there are some fields like validations of phone number which are yet to be tested or improved upon
noproblem functionalities of admins are working though many other functionalities   are yet to be implemented
noproblem i did see updates and commits 15 hours ago
noproblem yes added the working functionalities timely
noproblem the team has been pushing commits in a way that shows they have been making consistent progress on the project
noproblem yes they have around 21 commits
noproblem most files seem to be following good coding practices
noproblem the readme file is well constructed mvc files are properly made and easy to navigate db migrations can be seen easily as well overall good job done on this part
noproblem fairly good coding practices followed
noproblem the ui is well built as well specially the navigation bar at the top is a delight in terms of user experience
noproblem yes the controller and model for handling inquiries have been thoroughly tested
noproblem the team kept on pushing changes throughout the project period showing timely contributions from each team member in fact by looking at the commits each team member was probably assigned a dedicated module to work on which always works well to create such a big application
noproblem yes through the commit record i can see that this team has been keeping pushing their changes
noproblem there are more than 70 commits and they have been working continously
noproblem there were regular commits during the course of the project
noproblem fairly frequent commits to git
noproblem not much functionality is available of what is available however the code does follow   good ruby and rails coding practices
noproblem the code is very neat and easy to read but i can tell it is the auto generated code from scaffold
noproblem the application is deployed on heroku and the user interface is easy to use
noproblem no roles implemented
noproblem basic tests are present not custom tests though
noproblem yes good effort in case of pushing changes
noproblem no updates since 6 days ago
noproblem only on 2 days all together
noproblem well written code
noproblem yes the code follows good ruby and rails coding practices as the models views and controllers are well defined
noproblem the interface is preliminary but is easy to understand
noproblem i did see updates and commits 15 hours ago
noproblem yes added the working functionalities timely
noproblem the team has been pushing commits in a way that shows they have been making consistent progress on the project
noproblem yes they have around 21 commits
noproblem most code seems to be written with good coding practices in mind
noproblem the repository looks to be set up well and the app is laid out like a typical ruby on rails application good readme file was present as well
noproblem good coding style names are well selected and good readability
noproblem have used dry principles followed good coding practices
noproblem the code follows the right style and in a good format
noproblem they had a good amount of tests the usermodel
noproblem comprehensively tested for users
noproblem in the files they provided i found they provided test for most of controllers and models
noproblem have implemented basic testing could add more application specific test cases
noproblem last commit was 3 days ago so they are not continuous throughout the period
noproblem yes it looks like all team members contributed and they have 80 commits over the course of several weeks
noproblem so many commits it makes me proud starting as early as september 22nd they make progress up until today either way they passed this with flying colors
noproblem about 80 commits were done along the timspan
noproblem according to the record on github they committed for many times so they may keep pushing changes
noproblem evenly committed code during the project duration
noproblem the team pushed changes frequently
