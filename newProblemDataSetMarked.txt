problem Your team have put all "let" behind the code. However, there are, still, a lot of 'let(:response) { VmQuestionResponse.new(review_questionnaire, assignment, 1) }'. It is repetitive and unnecessary.  
problem Your home page is very clear as to the application purpose. Unfortunately, I am unable to sign up as a new user or login with any of the pre-configured user accounts included in the Readme. I can, however, attempt to sign up and/or login but this information is never saved to the database for future access or the appropriate transitioning is not implemented. I like that there are two options listed on the homepage to either sign up as a new user or to login in as a current user. This is convenient for navigation. Consider spacing these links for easier identification. I would also point out that the options in the drop down box included for selecting user type during sign up is a great idea. The third option, is a ambiguous as to its purpose. What does it mean to sign up as a realtor who is also shopping for a house? Perhaps you can just limit the options to Realtor or House Hunter. The functionality of searching homes should be included in the Realtor services. Keep up the work. Once the database is successfully receiving user details and/or the appropriate routes are assigned, additional functionalities should be easy to implement.
problem You should restrict the format of the website of company. After add a company, I can't edit and destroy my own company.
problem You haven't specified anything in your Readme file. Plus you have given a link to heroku app but its not working. Please make sure its working. I saw you guys had been committing code to your master branch, have you guys pushed it to heroku. That might be the reason it got broken.

problem You could have made the empty method end on one line. I think _args could be named args.
problem You can mention that what are you going to do, inorder to acheive your goal. Like it is mentioned that "As a part of the third project, weve already done with the implementation of OffscreenCanvas interface" So how are you going to achieve the next implementation?
problem You can explain more on what actually are you planning to change.
problem You can explain more on what actually are you planning to change.
problem You can add some more explaination of what exactly you'll do in issues like:  Issue #1072 - Issue related to instructor's assignment participation. I felt information is missing here.
problem You are not testing anywhere yet.
problem You are following good ruby coding practices. For some places where you are comparing for example in login_controller.rb if params[:login][:email] == 'admin@admin' && params[:login][:password] == 'admin' You can use a constant file where you can write these 'admin@admin.com' and use that constant. Its not a good practice to write it like this. Otherwise everything seems good.
problem You are following good coding practice. I have a suggestion that you can move realtors, admin and house hunters as childs of user. That is admin belongs to user, realtor belongs to user etc. Currently you have all the information in user model.
problem Yes.From the system and code, these code changes seem ready to be deployed in production after heavy integration testing as issues seem to be working, but github pull request shows more fixes to work upon.
problem Yes. The UI is easy to use. But the dashboard could be made better . As every task is written on the same line

problem Yes. The team intends to use grade_controller to show github metric which would be a good place to implement this functionality. The idea to involve instructors because of a 60 requests/hour limit may complicate the project. Another idea would be to update metrics with a round robin scheduling of GET requests.

problem Yes, well designed document. UI mock-ups given. It is structured. 
problem Yes, they surely have done a good job in mentioning the errors in the wiki doc. They have vaguely described the handling of the same, but doubts remain in the details or the changes in the code. Which means that a better job and a more technical description of how It is happening should be given so as to grasp a better understanding for the same.   
problem Yes, they surely have done a good job in mentioning the errors in the 1st part and the second part. But it is unclear why the 3rd fix is a problem or how they have combatted the 3rd fix in the first place. It just seems so that a screen shot has been put into place and they displayed a No Method Error popup. They have vaguely described the handling of the same, but doubts remain in the details or the changes in the code. In fact, no code screenshots have been put up for this case.

problem Yes, they include this part in the Proposed Solutions field. It would be better if they use visualization to let the readers better understand the flow.
problem Yes, they include project purpose, project design. It would be better if they include the testing plan.
problem Yes, they include project purpose, project design, and testing plan. It's a little short. It's suggested that add more details.  
problem Yes, they include all the functionality in the wiki page. They can work it better if they add more details and some visual aids.
problem Yes, they have tested a controller but not the model.

problem Yes, they have explained why they did that way and it was clear. They have compared and contrasted in each of their feature of "Current Implementation" and "Solution" which is a better way of showing what they implemented One more suggestion would be, it would have been good if they showed the difference in their code snippets too for the current implementation vs Solution proposed.

problem Yes, they add test cases, and the coverage is the same as the first round.
problem Yes, there were some improvements that I noticed while testing the site features in the review duration which included modifications to view list of all houses created by company of which realtor is a part. The program has scope for minimal improvements to make it function as needed.
problem Yes, there is one commit during round 2, and it fixed trivial rubcop issues related to indentation.  Two suggestions of adding meaningful comments for tree_display function in tree_display.jsx and second on having a single copy of RubricArray for two functions were not implemented.
problem yes, there is no mention of design pattern yet but overall design appear very clear to me
problem Yes, their code works pretty good, but their coverage is a big problem.

problem Yes, the writeup seemed to include everything that was required. Code was also attached along with the screenshots and steps.
problem Yes, the writeup explains explains how the authors did their work and they have mentioned the steps behind each functionality. Design principles are not used but overall quite nicely explained.

problem Yes, the Wiki is clear and explains most aspects of the project but there could be a better explanation for the IDL files that were added and the corresponding changes that were made because of adding these files
problem Yes, the wiki does explain the functionalities well. Could have been better to have more attributes in the subclasses in the diagram. This could help the user know about the details of the strategy pattern used.

problem Yes, the team made commits regularly, but some commits whose name suggest changes to the code (not heroku deployment), were done after the deadline of 10th Oct. If those changes were later reversed or not, cannot be ensured. From the reviewer's perspective I would suggest not to add any changes at all after the deadline, as we shouldn't be bothered about looking at what change is done in each commit. Stick to the work you had as it would be graded appropriately by the instructors.

problem Yes, the team made commits  days ago, but then it seems that they didn't follow-up with the feedback they received on the pull request, as their were 7 issues, though of minor severity, which required fixing, and then there were no commits after that.

problem Yes, the team has used flowcharts and diagrams which clearly describe the changes to be made to the system.
problem Yes, the team has taken care of it by specially making a section of what is the problem as the introductory section of the WIKI doc so as to make us understand the goals of the project. They have even attached code snaps of the relevant changes they have in mind whilst explaining the error. Although, one questions the details in which they should have gone into explaining the errors and resolution. More mentioning of details is required.

problem Yes, the team has made few code climate fixes and also added tests for the UTF-* encoding issue. though no test is available for the sanitize fixes. 
problem Yes, the team has made a very good testing plan, consisting of functional testing, which covers almost all of the use cases which have been added/modified. However, the author could have added code snippets of the same, instead of just discussing the proposed plan.

problem Yes, the team has explained their code and the reason for the additions made. However, for the issue #926, some more information about the Tablesorter and some additional comments would improve the writeup. Solutions to issue #718 and #971 are explained clearly and are easy to follow.

problem Yes, the team has considered the two important and required test cases- 1) To check whether "Assignments" is not present in the Instructor view, and check the presence of "Open Student View" button in the flyout menu. Here, the team has also checked the precondition whether the user is viewing the correct page (tree_display/list) which is meant for the Instructor.  2) To check the presence of "Close Student View" button for the instructor to return back to the default view and have the "Assignment"  tab for students.  Suggestion: The team could add a line to check whether the system returns back to the instructor page after clicking the "Close Student View" button. maybe include : "expect(page).to have_current_path('/tree_display/list')" .  
problem Yes, the team has committed changes in round 2 also. Overall it looks like the codes were pushed to master and one go. Regularly committing the files could have been better.
problem Yes, the team has added test cases, the code for a couple of test cases are in the wiki in a separate section. Again, it would have been better to explain the test cases a little more, may be using screenshots of successful test cases.

problem Yes, the team did add test cases to test their changes and their overall test coverage has increased.
problem Yes, the team did add test cases and the coverage increased too. But the team didn't put any efforts after the initial review round, since the failed tests are still failed, and there are no new commits since 12 days.
problem Yes, the team added visual aids like UML diagrams, screen shots, code snippets to clearly describe the changes to be made to the system. Well done!
problem Yes, the system works fine and authors have fixed the problems found in the first round. For an instance, Admin functionality and interest functionality were not present in round one but authors have implemented them now. 
problem Yes, the system handles all the entity relationships well. There is no mapping table as such, but all relationships has been addressed in correct association degree in the application.
problem Yes, the pull request did pass the Travis CI. It didn't has any conflicts with the base branch, but it did have some unresolved issues which needed to be fixed, namely: cognitive complexity was 6, and condition size for two files were too high.

problem Yes, the proposed solutions part clearly stated that they will go through each review to compare the new review score, etc, and then they will store the review URL. However, the solution is not concrete enough and is a little bit hard to follow. It should be great if there's more details in stating about how to loop through each reviews.

However, the solution is not concrete enough and is a little bit hard to follow. It should be great if there's more details in stating about how to loop through each reviews.  
problem Yes, the project is to do 2 things : 1. Stop teams from dropping assignments very late / close to deadline 2. Have different deadlines when assignments are done at different periods. The wiki should be created on expertiza page and not on wikipedia site.
problem Yes, the login / signup module seems to be very well tested, considering the fact that all the three types of users (admins, househunters and realtors) are managed by using the same table. But, there's also a small functional bug. Even if I hadn't regisitered as a househunter or a realtor, I am able to switch back and forth between the roles, which is kind of counter-intuitive in many ways.
problem Yes, the github api integration looks good. the only part missing was perhaps they could have documented the rest calls that they are going to make in the document as well. Usage of existing gems is good and eases lot of implementation pains

problem Yes, the design proposed by the author seem sound enough. However, the author has only given a high level view of the proposed design. The author should delve deeper into the concept more while describing the intended design.
problem yes, the design is the simplest I could think about. But it doesn't include how to change the files.  I think it can still be as simple and succinct if the modifications of files can be included. On the other hand, the expected result seems to be too long. There's too many screenshots

problem Yes, the design is sound and clear. Majority of the work is done by the suggestion algorithm. The team proposes to integrate this functionality into Expertiza and also improve the response time. This project does not need to incorporate any design pattern as only the view files are altered. The project does not impact the degree to which it is object oriented.
problem Yes, the design is simplified and also there is room for some thought that is explicitly stated such as --- not really following the DRY principle and the team is willing to work towards it which is really good.
problem Yes, the design is simple. The design includes details in checking rounds: when it's bigger than or equal to 2, add the checkbox and otherwise do nothing. However, I doubt if that's needed in design document. Since in the future if we need to do 3-round reviews, this 2 feature can be misleading.
problem Yes, the design is quite simple.
problem Yes, the design is as simple as it can get. Understanding the principle is not hard. But making it simple should also not make it costly. Good work to the team if the instructors were looking for something this simple :)
problem Yes, the design is as simple as it can be. The current scenario is explained with adequate screenshots, and the changes are explained by stating the field to be used for sorting the table. A mock-up screen of the expected output would have made it even better to understand, however reading the material is sufficient as well. The changes are not complex, as they interact with a single view at a time. The tablesorter function is also called for each view, e.g. view_submissions layout.

problem Yes, the design appears to be sound. There could be some rearrangement in the mock-up layout, e.g. text box for email address and 'Add' button could have the same horizontal alignment for a better user interface.
problem Yes, the database design and flowchart gives a clear picture what system will do after the required changes. Suggestion: add before & after changes screen mock-ups to your document.
problem Yes, the code was written well but a lot of functionalities related to the session was not added.
problem Yes, the code seems good to deploy if we consider the manual testing and the video demonstration. But since it didn't pass Travis CI, this claims seems a bit of a concern. If we ignore the fact that lines of code was >500, and thats why Travis CI failed, but still there are a few lingering issues which the Travis CI pointed, which still hasn't been fixed. It seems more of a patch, which would require more patches to patch in the future.

problem Yes, the code is written really well.
problem Yes, the code has been refactored to cover all the intended scenarios and the tests have been very well documented along with testing the edge cases as said from their videos. Their Rspec however doesn't seem to test many test cases but that's expected I guess given their problem statement. 
problem Yes, the code did pass Travis CI successfully, but as mentioned earlier, the code did fail on 7 grounds, of low severity. This should have been fixed by the team, as the issues were very small, and required just minimal follow-up.

problem Yes, the code change along with the screenshots does explain the ordeal, but the git screenshots and some more explanation would be well appreciated.
problem Yes, the code already followed all the good conventions earlier, except the lack of proper comments. The code still lacks comments, and the author hasn't made any changes since the last review. But the overall code quality is upto the mark.

problem Yes, the changes work as expected in the UI. The test cases cover most of the scenarios. Would have been good if there was some scope for negative test cases that could be explained.
problem Yes, the changes were committed throughout, but the commit messages could be a bit more descriptive.

problem Yes, the build passes Travis CI. No, it did not had any conflicts. There was only one message, which was a warning, but apart from that, it everything seemed perfect.
problem Yes, the authors have specified the changes that have already been implemented as a part of the OSS project and the proposed set of changes that are to be implemented as a part of the final project. Detailed information on the changes already made is available as a Wiki link to the previous document. This document clearly captures the implementation of the OffScreenCanvas Webidl and Rust files. The design document attached in this round encompasses the proposed design of- implementation of the OffScreenCanvasRenderingContext2D and enabling of the blob API for testing the code. The authors have also listed the files changed and to be changed, making it easier for the reviewers to keep track of the code on Github. Though the text is lucid, lack of a visual tool- (like flow charts, tables or UML diagrams) to concisely illustrate the workflow might make it difficult for new readers to follow the functionalities proposed and the interlinking of various modules. So, one suggestion at this point is that the authors could have included a visual representation of the design. Apart from that, the document is well made and credits to the team.
problem Yes, the authors have nicely explained the changes to be made. This includes, the flow diagrams, UML diagrams and many of the screenshots. Good work team. Suggestion: Could include screenshots, if any, of the test plans implemented.

problem yes, the authors have improved the code. the team has worked on the issue which I mentioned in the previous review. The code doesn't seems to be confusing now but it still needs proper commenting to be done. 
problem Yes, the authors are using already existing gems for the implementation. I would have liked to see a section on caching if any.  Rest the solution proposed looks simple and straightforward and looks that it will easily integrate into the current system

problem Yes, team kept on submitting their changes throughout the project and no commits are made in round 2.
problem Yes, team has added the test case
problem Yes, since the issues are fixed as required, I think that the project can be merged to the production server. However, there is some work on the conflicts upon resolution of which the fixes can be included to the code. I don't think that there is a need to take another approach for solving the issues.
problem Yes, seems to be so the case in effect the last commit being just 5 hrs ago. But what changes against each file have been made is not clear hence its a bit unclear as to the extent and the number of changes made. Moreover, the amount of subject matter and the number of sessions or models are far too less to be implementing any changes as such.

problem Yes, on manual testing, it leads to realization that the code has been suitably written as required by the functionalities and also the doc they have provided is the results that I get on following the procedure. Although, I would suggest that they look more into the test case 3 because how to go about testing it hasn't been explained by them.

problem Yes, no conflict that's not resolved.
problem Yes, new code has been committed in the 2nd round. The team has essentially implemented the offscreencanvas.rs and offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs. offscreencanvas.rs is respondible for implementing the OffscreenCanvas.webidl. This interacts directly with javascript and when a new instance of offscreencanvas is created, it calls the constructor with arguments height and width which in turn calls the new method defined in this file. It also contains the reflector object that tells the Javascript garbage collector to ignore the canvas object while clearing memory. Additionally, it has the implementation of the getContext() method that returns a weak reference to OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2d, which is responsible for doing background rendering task. offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs has the implementation of OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2D. It does not interact directly with JavaScript, so it does not have the Constructor or reflector. The functionality to build an offscreencanvas object has been implemented in this file.  
problem Yes, looks clean. Any design patterns used????
problem Yes, it works as intended. It would be better if you could add a video recording of the flow/screenshots of the flow in the test plan. 
problem Yes, it simple but some parts are not easy to understand.
problem Yes, it simple but some parts are not easy to understand.
problem Yes, it simple but some parts are not easy to understand.
problem Yes, it seems very sound. They list what they are going to do in 4 fields.
problem Yes, it seems like sound, however, the authors could add some principles and patterns into it.
problem Yes, it has the implementation plan of a checkbox, which allows the instructor to decide about review times. Since that is the only thing to be implemented, there's no more issues. I think the diagram doesn't have very pretty look, it should be better if the screenshot can be smaller so that the fonts in the diagrams can be seen more clearly.
problem Yes, it does explain but could have added more details to make it clear. 
problem Yes, it does explain but could have added more details to make it clear. 
problem Yes, in my opinion the team has understood the topic well and clearly listed all the functionality as described in the design document. Good Job !!
problem Yes, I was able to understand the issue as well as the solution overall. But I couldn't understand why there is a need to append a team name to an assignment. It was just mentioned that it is done in other part of the code as well. Mentioning that would have given me a better idea.

problem Yes, everything that the project required to do works. There were a few things which caused issues in the pull request, but none of it related to the functionality of the product to be tested, but rather related to the code complexity. Even the video demonstration clearly shows the changes implemented.
problem Yes, even constraints were defined well
problem Yes, Design shows a good amount of work to be done. Team is not using any design pattern.  
problem Yes, design seems fit. More insight required on the algorithm itself and how it will be implemented.

problem Yes, changes we committed in round 2. Code commit could have better by committing as soon as possible. Committing few files and writing proper comments and description for the commit was missing. As a reader, I was not able to understand what a particular commit meant and what module was changed because there was no proper explanation.

problem Yes, changes to be made are explained clearly. Document is very clear, includes necessary diagrams, mock-ups and everything possible to make anyone understand what the issues are and what team is planning to do to resolve them. Everything is included in a proper order like for each issue there is a separate flowchart and mock-up. No suggestions required.
problem Yes, but they didnt show their principles and pattern very well.

problem Yes, but they didnt show their principles and pattern very well.
problem Yes, but I find a small bug, the admin can edit his profile and select change his role to realtor, although his role did not change, there is no error report.
problem Yes, both the the issues seem to be fixed from the screencast video. It clearly explains the before and after scenarios and the system works as expected.  The test plan is still missing for the fixed issues.
problem Yes, as per the solution provided, it does seem that the design incorporates the required functionality. It considers sorting on all the specified fields. Suggestions: Since you have mentioned the use of jQuery tablesorte, you may also add explanation as to what is tablesorter and try explaining atleast for one field (e.g. name) as to how does it work to sort the entries.    
problem Yes, as its sorting, not much scope on design approach. Yet the team has documented well on their approach regarding multi-level sortings that they are undertaking in few pages. They have also considered cross-browser compatibility of their jQuery library, which is a common design miss during client-side changes.
problem Yes, apart from the 7 issues of minor severity from codeclimate, the code is perfectly well to integrate with the project. No, the project need not be planned and executed from scratch, it is implemented well enough.
problem Yes, and at times, much more than necessary! 
problem Yes, almost everything seems perfect, only a little more explaination is required
problem Yes, almost everything seems perfect, only a little more explaination is required
problem Yes, all the functionalities, including viewing submission, viewing scores, viewing review report, author feedback report, teammate review report are all available. I believe a more intuitive, detailed explanation or description might be even more useful, while describing the functionalities in the design. Here, such design is still just simply stated as the project goal.

problem Yes, a good test plan is also included
problem Yes, a fairly good job in that regard. They have first explained their test plans, then even provided links to their RSPEC tests which I checked. Then they have run and shown their screenshots of the Rspec tests going through successfully. Even, so their coverage seems to be an issue since it hasn't been updates since the last submission that was 19 days ago as per their pull request which even shows a decrease in their coverage.  
problem Yes visual aid has been provided in the form of Flow charts and screen shots. UML could added.
problem Yes very well written. I would have given full marks if you would have added code snippet and screenshot of the before and after feature. Visually it would have been great to understand the changes quickly.

problem Yes there were some commits fixing the travis and code climate issues.
problem Yes there is one conflict that must be resolved to go ahead reported by TRAVIS CI.
problem Yes there is one conflict that must be resolved to go ahead reported by TRAVIS CI.
problem Yes the writeup explains how and why the did the modifications. It has comparisons between the previous and new versions and why they made they made the necessary modifications.  There was no mention of using design principles or patterns.

problem Yes the UI is pretty smooth and a person can navigate freely. However, in some cases there is no "back" link in the web-page, so the user has to use browser navigation to go to the previous page.
problem Yes The UI is interactive and easy to use.
problem Yes the test plan is included but the test plan appears to be very shallow as it gives the which functionalities must be test but doesn't mentions it inform of test like what should be the actions taken when a certain condition arises it can be more clearly stated by mentioning the test cases in form of context and it statements

problem Yes the team seem to have a clear idea as to what must be done and how the result must look. It would be helpful if the team gave some insights as to how the composite score formula was decided as this is the heart of the project.

problem Yes the team has added tests. I am not sure of the increase in coverage as it is not mentioned in the doc. however, the team has very well explained how the tests were done and what areas they have tested.
problem Yes the team has added test for the UTF encoding acceptance. the coverage is not 100% and not tested with varied inputs but i believe would suffice for sanity check. Although the description of test in rspec file is ambiguous not clearly mentioning what exactly the test is expected to do. There is no test available for the issue 2 documented
problem Yes the team did add test cases but I am surprised on why the coverage numbers have fallen so much. This needs some investigation.  I think good test cases were added as part of the work, i would have though liked to see more -ve test cases checking for the failure conditions

problem Yes the relationships are handled properly 1 company multiple realtors etc. No mapping table as such the schema handles it
problem Yes The project is complete and sound enough in its approach and the implementations and the test plan has been well devised and just shy of application.  
problem Yes the project is a test project for menu.rb. The code coverage has increased to 100%. Though the code covers all lines, i feel edge cases are not covered well. 
problem Yes the Problem Statement and Design Approach sections explain clearly what the usecase is and what the authors think will be a good design to implement.The changes are clearly explained. Having some file names would be useful to review in detail.
problem Yes the presence of use case diagrams and flow charts explaining the work flow is good. It would be nice if there were more uml diagrams such as sequence so show various class interactions.  Presence of mockup screens is good. That helps in understanding what is being implemented. It would have been good if the authors put in more details about the validations that that propose in the system

problem Yes the flow diagram and graph plots help to understand the changes and its implications. The diagrams clearly describe the change approach followed.
problem Yes the features work as described in the problem statement. The team has done good job and has fixed all the below issues: Issue #971 Change create topic UI into AJAX. Issue #926 We need a way to sort topics by topic number in assignment#edit page. Issue #718 We should allow instructors to give feedback when accepting or rejecting topic suggestions.
problem Yes the documentation looks complete  and states the project purpose and solution are stated . The project design could be described in more detail.
problem Yes the document mainly talks about small changes at different places in the application that are being done. I think more implementation details with ample justification are missing. if the team is using certain apis why are they using should have been mentioned.  
problem Yes the design looks simple. The use of mock up screens is good and greatly helps understand the flow that has been proposed. Good work! How ever in one of the flow charts the check for "Is Admin" does not show/label  "Y" or "N" path

problem Yes the design is sound and appeopriate. However, it may be better to implement more code level design.
problem Yes the design is pretty good. The patterns followed avoids any duplication of code. But I had made a suggestion in Review One to take a look at Project 1843 and it's code. The problem statement is quite similar and the code could be reused. I don't see any mention of it. I hope you do take a look before starting to code as it will avoid any re-work.

problem Yes the coverage is good but the test scenarios are fairly straightforward and no elegant stubs or mocks used. The code isnt DRY 
problem Yes the authors have tried to explain what changes are required and what they plan to do however I feel that exact changes that they might be doing are missing. They could have listed most files that will need modification and if necessary new files that will be changed

problem Yes the author has explained the adequately the changes to be made to the system by giving a detailed flow diagram of the workflow of the the would be implementing the functionality of keeping a track of the review time of a student
problem yes the application flow diagram tells of how the functionality will be accessed both by user and student and the use case diagram explains the interaction of the instructor and the students for the particular functionalities 
problem Yes team had been pushing changes on github continuously with neat commit messages in Round 2 also.  With 49 commits till now. Yes i can see last commit on 11 th Oct 2018. But commits are not distributed equally.

problem Yes screen shots are helpful but the document missing flow control diagrams 
problem Yes partially, the code has the parameters not well defined for all only one conceivable user seemingly admin and that too is doubtful to have the correct MVC Layout.  For instance, they seem to have created separate MVC architectures for Admins, Companies and Users only. This goes to show that they are lacking in a layered approach on access and privileges.  Also, the code is written in a reasonably clean and formatted style with the variable definitions to be self-explanatory of the functionalities they perform in most cases for whichever few roles defined.

problem Yes Most of the issues identified are fixed 1) Admin not able to delete user accounts
problem Yes it states the plan, design well. Testing can be better represented in terms of whether its UI testing or Automated tests etc.
problem Yes it explains with clarity the issue at hand, UTF-8 only support & how that causes trouble. Also improper formatting of HTML tags.
problem Yes good write up but would have like to see details on model.  In test plan lines like " two test cases for method " are redundant. Can / should remove them 
problem yes good number of tests added coverage increased a but but i would like to see more -ve tests. Mostly +ve test cases are covered in the tests

problem Yes features work as intended but I would like to see tests as well as testing case were job addition to queue fails. I understand this would be edge case and not likely to happen but still needs to be handled. Other edge cases such as participant_mails is nil have been taken care of.  
problem Yes design appears to be sound. Also the flow diagram helps us understand it better. Team did not use any design pattern. 
problem Yes commits are done to fix the code climate issues.
problem Yes authors have done well to explain the changes being done in the project. I think I wish they would have added is the details of languages they are supporting.   Also they do mention that they will add extra column to languages table, they could have pasted the new schema in the doc

problem Yeah, the build has passed the Travis CI test and there were no conflicts found on the pull request.
problem Yeah, I believe it is as simple as possible while choosing the best path for the expertiza project to grow, but it still sounds like a very ambitious project for 1 group to complete.
problem Y'all did the least possible work, AND put it on wikipedia instead of the expertiza wiki.
problem Y'all did the least possible work, AND put it on wikipedia instead of the expertiza wiki.
problem Wrtie up clearly explains the project purpose, what changes needs to be made, however including a mock test plan would have been better.
problem Writeup needs to be improved, video needs to have sound or make shorter videos. Build is failing, code climate has 56 issues. So no its not ready for deployment onto production. The way they have implemented is fine but they need to work on the said issue to make it production ready.

problem Writeup is written well. No design principle or pattern involved, But the approach taken is explained in detail, step by step.   Team could add references and links.  
problem Writeup is written well and explained properly with good indentation, content and screenshots. Team could have explained test plan in more brief so as to understand number of test scenarios covered. 
problem Writeup is written very neatly and in elaborated fashion with understandable images. Team could have added Github Expertiza link and pull request link at the bottom of the wiki page. Also references and credits.
problem Writeup is very clearly explained. Writeup clearly explains how they are doing their work but why team is following approach is not explained. 
problem writeup is too concise code were addded. But the implementation was not explained in detail.

problem Writeup is descriptive. But missing the following: 1. Screenshots of implementation 2. Steps to replicate the problem  3. Instructions not provided. 4. Too many sub topics for solution implemented
problem Writeup is decent. I felt that code should have been quoted rather than included pictures of as that would make it easier to modify. The pngs weren't same size which appears to be negative that people  have commented on my work too.

problem Writeup explains what was to be done and how they did it, but does not give rationale behind the way they coded, and any alternative approaches.

problem Writeup clearly explains what their use cases are and what solution they came up with. There is a lack of background about it, how to test it from UI, test plan, test cases, DRY principle etc. Their write up is not on wiki, which makes it difficult to download the file every time and check it. Although it was pointed out during the first round, the team didn't change it , or they didn't update the wiki page which they created.

problem Write-up provides all the necessary information needed to understand the project but a brief explanation about certain methods would have been better. 
problem Write-up needs serious attention of the team. The approach followed is good but it still needs to be worked on. the write-up should include contents which makes it self-explanatory.

problem Write up isn't provided. I went through their git commit and the requirement for  issue #1201. There is a 'puts' statement in the controller. I feel that should be removed, you guys might have added it for debugging purposes, but it should be removed before committing. Also, not sure how the changes made are applicable to the problem at hand which is to check if assignments have the same name if I'm not wrong.
problem Write up isn't good. They have just added there code in the write up without explaining anything. Plus no comments in code. Code snippets in writeup are going off the page.
problem Write up is written well and it is understandable. Images are not in proportion and not of same size and hence wiki page does not look steady. Team can work on image size and image description and manual test plan in more detail.

Error in deleting a user if the user has submitted an inquiry/reply House hunter can add a house to interest list multiple times, should not be allowed, by maybe hiding the button if the house is already in the current user's interest list.

problem When delete a user with inquiry data, the system crush and return an error.
problem When an admin deletes a real estate company which has realtors and houses, the company gets is getting deleted along with the realtors which is not the expected functionality because realtors can exist even without being a part of a company. The realtor should not get deleted from the database. Could not test whether the inquiries are deleted if the house hunter is deleted because the admin is unable to delete a house hunter from the Users list.
problem When admin try to delete a user, the website return some error. When the admin try  to delete a real estate company, it just redirect to the edit route instead of delete the company 
problem When admin deletes a company associated with a realtor, it gets reflected in the realtors profile. His company name shows nothing and the houses listed were also deleted. Admin is not able to view house hunters profile (error in deployment), but can view the same using Users section. When a user is deleted by admin, his inquiries are removed and he is no more a potential buyer too. When realtor changes/ creates new company, his previous company houses are deleted. This is reflected in the admin table too. Realtor is not able to view houses listed by others.  Edge cases A company can be created without filling in the fields required. (Yes an empty row is displayed to the hunter when a company is created without any detail). But it displays the Company number (row number) while seeing the houses. So a house is shown for a company that doesnt exist in the View companies page. Session control : When user signs out from a page and then goes back, the profile page should not be shown (as he is signed out). This should be considered.
problem When a real estate company is deleted, the respective houses are deleted, the realtors are not. Further, even after deletion, the company of those realtors remains the same. They can even edit the deleted company from their profile and list a house on behalf of the deleted company. When a realtor edits and updates his company after it is deleted, it actually gets created again. When a realtor changes his company, he can view only the houses of his current company and is prohibited to delete houses of his previous company. This works as expected. When a house hunter is deleted, (s)he gets removed from the potential buyers list, but inquiries are only partially deleted as in the row is still there but only two columns show data.      
problem When a company is deleted by the admin, the realtor's profile, belonging to that company, crashes.

problem What and how explained well but they explain the why behind their actions a bit more.
problem Well, we can say that they have indeed tested the models they have defined in their README file on GitHub. The definitions of the functionalities in the 'db' folders and the controllers folder makes it very easy to follow how they have structured the code. Also, the way the houses are added, the redirection the houses to the links such as CMU and NCSU websites is very intuitive and well thought out, and thus barring out a few minor mistakes in linking and page definitions the code has a good ability to run for the defined cases specially for the Admin to be failsafe. Only, one complaint though, the whole structure does crumble when one sees that they have allowed the admin to be DELETED. This is their biggest loophole. 
problem Well, not much information has been given on the wiki page. Though they have put some UML flow diagrams which give us an idea of the flow.

problem Well written and able to follow. However, I see no branches created (and hence pull requests merged). All work is pushed direct to master.
problem Well structured code using MVC pattern.  Couldn't find admin credentials mentioned on readme. 
problem Well done! Most of the functionality I commented on last time has been fixed with very intuitive UI. The only thing I couldn't find still was being able to view all inquiries as an admin. Very good updates overall!

problem Uses UML diagrams and images to explain where the changes will be made.
problem User view is easy to understand and navigate. There are certain links which don't work and doesn't load any page.  
problem User Role-: Once a user is created, and goes to edit their profile, if they uncheck both roles there is no way for that user to get any role back. Their should be a check in the user table that both roles cannot be blank. Also, unfortunately there is no mention of how the system handles edge cases in the Readme file

The realtor can switch to another company. They will be prohibited to remove the houses listed in the previous company though. 3. The house hunter accounts are deleted without their inquiries . 4. The System does not check for regex fr phone number input during signup.

problem Upon manually testing the author's work it is noticed that the functionalities have not been implemented to the full. The team did perform migration of the CRUD functionality for the Questionnaires from QuestionnairesController and removed large patches of if-case statements by placing it in the helper function in the apt model. This however has reduced their coverage.
problem Unsure in this regard since they neither have the deployment neither the GitHub link to their repository, and also the coverage and the Travis CI say otherwise. Even so, in their video they show in proof that everything runs. One does wonder though, how to test without actually having the links of the repo.

problem Unfortunately, the build failed in the second round. But, in my opinion this was not due to the team's mistake. The build failure says the two examples failed are in files "assignment_spec.rb" and "assignment_participant_spec.rb", both files which the team had no connection with. I could be wrong though. As the build was passing and there tests were running in the first round, I am inclined to believe it was because of another team's incorrect code that this team pulled into their branch by mistake.

problem Unfortunately, no tests were added. It would have been good if the team added test cases to check their UI changes.
problem Unfortunately, no mention of the word "test plan" has even taken place in their whole Wiki page. So, it seems that they are yet to implement the testing functionalities in their project. Although, it would have been better if they had checked if the checks or the tests already existed in the first place in the git repository.

problem Unfortunately, most of the test cases failed while testing The realtor does not get deleted from the system after the deletion of his/her respective real estate company. The link to create new houses redirects to a different link, hence I was not able to create new houses and test certain cases The inquiries submitted by the house hunter remain in the database even after the deletion of the house hunter All the inquires of the particular house are shown to every realtor, which is not an ideal case These are some of the cases that need attention. Owing to the work done on remainder of the project, these changes would be implemented easily with some effort

problem Unfortunately, I am unable to view this Git Repository. This is, most likely, due to the fact that the repo is set to private and only available to those currently collaborating. I would suggest making the setting adjustment for the repo to be public so reviewers and TA's can grade the work that has been completed. When coding, take note of the stylistic norms of Ruby regarding method calls, parenthesis, and syntax best practices. Additionally, maintain a consistent indention scheme for ease of review.
problem Unfortunately, all the edge cases in the given question are failing The system encounters an error while deleting a real estate company After changing the real estate company, the realtor can still delete the house that he had created with a previous company Even after deleting the user from the dashboard, the queries submitted by the users are not deleted There was no potential buyers list available for viewing even after adding houses to the interest list myself These cases could be seen upon and improved

problem UI is easy to use, a suggestion would be to display tables of data better, with better spacing (the list houses page for example has the columns cramped up together)
problem UI is easy to understand, but problematic to use.  Admin must use user ids to create hunters or realtors or inquiries and the display is via user IDs too. Signup page redirect to show all signed up users. From there, any one who is not logged in can delete users. Same user can be added as house hunter any number of times with separate entries. No validations are added (I can choose role no. 5 for signup), and no error messages have been provided. Passwords are in plain text. In some cases, wrong notices are displayed - create user with wrong info gives "User account was successfully created. AAA!" which is incorrect as user was not actually created.  Back to your page links do not work

problem This project is on implementing a single rejoinder per team for reviews instead of per participant reviews and also makes the feedback link for reviews more accessible. The writeup explained the background about Expertiza and the motivation for the project. It then moved on to list the tasks that were implemented and files that were modified in the project. It showed the current and new implementation clearly. The writeup, however, could have quoted the tests done using RSpec and the UI, instead of plainly mentioning the that the tests were modified to suit the current implementation.

problem This is where the project lacks the mos. The write-up isn't very informative, specially for an outsider. It states the points very shortly, without going into much depth. Also, the writeup bombards the user with lots of un-relevant information and pieces of code, which make it feel very long, although lacking significant content. The writeup could have been more detailed, and could have omitted the unnecessary parts, like dumping of code, and not explaining what it does.

problem This doesn't apply here much as its just writing testcases. However some of the tests documented in Menu like Mean with role and without role are confusing. I had to look through the entire doc to figure out why is that written that way.

problem They team has successfully followed most of the conventions of good programming principles of ruby. The schema was very detailed and cohesive, and the variables were named appropriately and effectively. The readme provided was helpful, but the project lacked in program documentation / comments, which made me to go through each line of code to make sense out of the code. Apart from that, the practices seemed good.

problem These are my views on their writeup: 1.  Certain sections are too bold. I find that to be distracting. 2.  I like the way that they highlighted the lines of code that they have edited/modified. It made it easier to understand their work. 3. It was also good that they included references section at the end. It was something that I haven't seen in the other projects I have reviewed so far.
problem There's still some minor style issues in the code regarding unnecessary parenthesis.
problem There's only one diagram, from the perspective of the user, in terms of how the functionality should be like. It does clearly describe the changes to be made to the system. It should be better if there's another diagram, which explains the work flow, in terms of which files we need to do at each step, and what we need to do one step after another to implement the project.

problem There's a flow chart about how the end result look like. But the flow chart only tells a user story. There's no detailed implementation plan in this flow chart. 3):  some diagrams are too high-level design and do not provide enough details. applies here.
problem There were some issues which I reported regarding comments and Notice messages displayed to User which needs to be improved. But they haven't been incorporated. It is not a blocker but definitely an important change to improve User Experience and better code readability. For example, In submitted_content controller there is a comment which says sending email to users. However it is just a method call which redirects it to delayed_mailer.rb. So this should be properly mentioned as it will be helpful for someone refactoring or understanding the code later.

problem There were mock-ups of the final result of the project however there were no UML diagrams. I think the UML diagrams are not necessary for this project since the flow of how the instructor will change the language is fairly simple and one can understand it by just reading the document. Maybe they could have done a mock-up of how some of the other views would have looked like once the language has changed. Especially the pages with flash messages if any. Currently they have just shown the proposed changes on the page where the instructor will change the language.

He/She may be able to offer a way to gauge the ease and effectiveness of your site. They may also offer valuable insight into feature placement and page flow.
problem There was no functionality implemented during 1st review. So there is a drastic improvement. However there are some functionalities which need further improvements. 1)Admin has no option to post or view houses.2)Admin is not able submit inquiry or reply to inquiries.3) Admin has no option currently to edit his profile. He should be able to edit his name. 4)Multiple Realtors and House Hunters can be created with the same email ID. There is no email or role validation. This will allow a lot of duplicate entries and the app will also be suseptible to attacks by robots. Can be improved by a 2 line validation code in model.5) Password should be encrypted. While entering the details too it should not be displayed as plain text. Can be improved by simply using type as password instead of text  in views. and applying encryption in model so that password is encrypted throughout the application6) Search House Functionality does not work when a new house is created. It shows the same old results.7)Also the description specifies Search by Price Range. But it has only one field to input price. This won't work if the user wants to see a house which is between 1000 to 3000 bucks or any house which is less then 3000 bucks. Since the app shows only houses greater then the price entered.8) Realtor is able to create a house even if he is not associated with a company. 9) Realtor is able to view potential buyers and reply to inquiries for all houses without being associated to a company. There should be a check to ensure that realtor is able to post a house only if he is associated with a company. Also the option to view potential buyers and reply to inquiries should only be enabled for houses which are associated with his company. In case of no company association he should be promted to associate himself with a company or create a new company first.

problem There must be some test cases that should have been covered according to Travis CI. Also the build has failed. However, the team claims that some of the tests are running locally. If some of these points are looked upon, the code would be ready to be deployed on the main server.
problem There isnt any commit after the first submission.
problem There is some repetition of code but overall code quality is ok. There are some comments from the professor which should have been addressed.  
problem There is some explanation about the general idea of what needs to be added to implement the new functionality; however, there are several sections missing that give light to the details of implementation and how this is tested to ensure correctness. Adding a description of where and how this new model will be developed with the existing image would  be beneficial for a thorough understanding of the reader. This could also be achieved by rearranging the logic of the sections as sum sections elude to purpose and intent of implementation.
problem there is only one relationship in the whole project. Not a good database design. Plus destroying one entity won't delete another as i can see from the code. Rest i am not able to test as i am not able to login other than admin. Not able to register as well.

problem There is only a title for test plan, which could be in a great detail.
problem There is only a single test file included with this application, sessions_controller_test. The functionality tested within this file attempts to cover starting a new user session. The test ensures that a new session is returned through an assertion statement equating to true. There are many additional functions of the sessions controller that should be tested including create, destroy, successful log in, etc. Making sure that each of these methods are functional will aid in the development of further successful application flows. I would recommend testing the basic models and their accompanying controllers before you begin implementing things such as house inquires and user responses.
problem There is only 1 issue stated in the Code climate regarding code refactoring. If that is done, this code can be merged.

problem There is one box for both review controller and assignment controller. A better picture of how they handle each event differently would have been helpful.
problem There is nothing wrong in current design. Looks good. Suggestion: However Since I have already worked on a similar assignment so I know that similar issue has already been resolved for drop topic deadline. You can reuse the entire code and just change deadline type. Have a look at OSS project topic- 1843.  Check with the Professor once.
problem There is not a specific Test Plan section in the wiki. There is a Work to be Done section that discusses the work that should be completed for project success. I would suggest rearranging or rename this section and continue to describe your plan of attack for testing.

problem There is no link provided to test the code manually. However from the video provided, I can infer that all the features have been implemented and are working properly. Issue #718 and #926 are working as expected. In issue #971, I could see that the previous version of the 'add new topic' page had a topic description and topic category field which is not seen in the updated version. Suggestion: The team could implement that or if already implemented, add that to the wiki page to reflect the way in which that is handled

problem There is a hint of visual aid in terms of the section of Application flow for the Instructor and student and thus we can say that it does slightly help get a sense of putting things into perspective.  1. None. Both the diagrams seem important enough for the scope of the project and in conjunction with the intended functionalities. 2. The UML diagram is in line with the conventions and follows suite. 3. The diagram of the instructor can be said to be bordering on one to be too high level and should go a bit more into detail.

problem There are two git links given, not sure which one to review? So reviewing the one which has more commits. Major functionalities are not implemented so cannot comment on this. Namings are properly given as per the rails standard.
problem There are still session variables and route names being displayed on some of the screens which were suggested to be removed. The functionality is quite good considering there was no implementation during first review. Potential Buyers functionality is not implemented. Enquiry functionality doesn't work . It throws application error check logs error when clicked. Possibly a deployment issue. When  a new house is created , it is not displayed in the listings immediately. Admin login doesn't work. It may be possible that someone might have edited admin login during review or else please paste the latest login details in Readme.

problem There are some style issues related to spacing and unnecessary parenthesis. 
problem There are some small problems like final newline missing, but overall looks good. 
problem There are some repetitions in the code which can be avoided by creating a helper function and calling that function from each place. But apart from that code is well thought out and implemented nicely.
problem There are some really great controller tests included in this application. Most of the functions in each controller are tested to ensure that they are returning and routing to the appropriate pages. Unfortunately, there are no model tests implemented. Model tests should be written to test that the appropriate attributes and relationships of each model are implemented successfully. It will prove extremely helpful in the improved functionality of your application. Make your model tests look like the controller test and you will be doing great!  
problem There are some instances of variable names that are concatenated with numbers, for example answer2, questionnaire2 etc. While this approach can be justified in some cases, I would suggest using more descriptive names instead or arrays if multiple instances are required. For example team could be used instead of team1 because that is the only Team instance variable in the source code.

problem There are some indentation issues, but otherwise the code has method names in line with convention over configuration and the spacing and line spacing are reasonable. Also, IDs should not be on the UI. The house hunters and realtors should not have to sign in after signing up.

problem There are some functionalities which needs to be implemented. Areas you should focus on are destroy is not working correctly in some cases,application is getting crashed again and again. admin should not be deleted by user. how is house associated with a company is something which I was not able to understand.  
problem There are some duplicate codes could substitute with "before" statement. For example, line 100 are exactly the same with line 108, it is better to use "before" even if there is only one line duplicate.

problem There are several improvements over the last review. Dropdowns have been implemented, which make a huge improvement to the ease of use of the system.    While the UI has become a lot better, there are several flaws:  Admin is shown to be registered as a realtor, but cannot be redirected to the pages(househunter link works). Househunter can set another hunter's interest liist by manipulating id.  Househunter can edit companies. Admin cannot destroy users,  Admin can not create/edit/destroy a realtor - error page is shown. Realtor can list houses even if not enrolled in a company Admin can not destroy househunter. Passwords are visible to admin,.   There are a few minor problems which, if dealt with, would make code even better:  Proper error messgaes - while signing up with wrong password length, a heroku error shows up which makes it feel like the functionality isn't working, whereas the problem can be user's fault as they  could have entered only 4 digit pin. Let users know that they need to provide proper input.   Also, please do not ask passwords in a text field. A very simple change can go a long way.
problem There are quite a lot of commits meaning that the team could have grouped some of the changes together into one commit instead of commiting every small modification to make them more meaningful
problem There are project purpose and design but no testing plan is included.

problem There are no diagrams present in the document. While the diagrams for apis and class interactions may have been helpful they are not necessary for this project as the authors provide a detailed explanation of the relevant functionalities.
problem There are no changes to any files in the spec directory so there are no new tests.
problem There are new commits, however the quality of commit messsages is terrible. Commit message should have a short description of what was changed not just be random words like foo1, foo2 or hasdfsdsd.

I don't know if it's me or maybe my lack of familiarity with the Bacui interface but I found the navigation part a bit difficult to follow.

problem There are many places where "puts" statements are used where a logger statement should be used. There is also a set of if/else blocks that check to see if a variable is of a certain type, which could have been abstracted with an appropriate design pattern.

problem There are different diagrams being used: 1. Use case diagram which describes the flow of how different users would navigate to the GitHub metric pages. 2. Mockup of their implementation which details the presence of a separate tab for GitHub metrics integration. They also plan to add some graphs which i think would be very useful to the instructors.
problem There are commits on a single day, that is yesterday. One suggestion would be to commit regular progress on the git.

Also, there are a lot of navigational bugs. For example, when a user is both, a realtor and a househunter, he gets an option to create a new company when viewing list of enquiries, which should not have been the cae.
problem There are a lot of diagrams, but the application flow and the UML Diagram doesn't look very clear. We can hardly see the words in the UML Diagram. Also, the diagrams seem to not fit each other. How does the application diagram and the Uml diagram connect to each other? There's no clear instructions. Also, I don't think a screen shot of code in the design doc is a good idea. I think it could be better if the changes expected to be made can be described in a more abstract fashion.

problem There a large set of variables that do not follow typical ruby naming convention. An example is that "existAssignment" should be "exit_assignment". Additionally, some names are not very helpful. For instance, the variable "frm" is used for a form, but why not just use "form"? There is also a lot of javascript written directly on the page and are difficult to read and understand as there is missing method names or other non-intuitive variable names

problem The writeup was clear enough to be understood by anyone familiar with developing or contributing on expertiza. It provided a high level view, and then dug deep into implmentation, which is great since it saves time, and also look concise. But for someone outside the domain of expertiza, it feels too sudden of a transition that it takes time and in many cases other resources to figure out why the author did what he did. But the overall flow and structure was very great.

problem The writeup states correctly the changes performed, but fails to provide a reasoning behind every change. Suggestion: You can include reasons behind choosing an approach, for atleast one refactoring code change
problem The writeup starts off by introducing Servo- Mozilla's experimental high performance browser engine and Rust- which is a systems programming language with memory safety and concurrency used to build Servo. It then moves over to Web Audio API for handling audio operations inside audio context and allow modular routing, and a workflow for implementing Web Audio was clearly listed. It then flows into the scope of the project and the implementation. The graphical and mathematical representation of the sine, square, sawtooth and triangle waveform gave a solid conceptual foundation. The code snippet of the changes done in oscillator_node.rs and the new file oscillator.rs (created by the team) has also been included. The section Build that explains the procedure to install dependencies (Rust), step by step procedure for building and running the build was very useful to explore the project. The team had included the build instructions for Windows and Debian-based Linux. They could have augmented the build instructions for Mac OS X, which might save Mac Users from reading verbose instructions on the official documentation and instead refer to a single source (the wiki). The authors end the wiki by providing the test plan with examples of generated sine, square, sawtooth and triangle waveforms as audio files; pull request and references.

Suggestion: 1. The author can describe how they came up with an approach starting from analyzing the issue. This will remarkably improve the writeup. 2. The author can talk about atleast one more approach to fix the solution and explain why they chose a particular approach for implementation.

problem The writeup explains everything regarding why and how the steps were carried out.
problem The writeup expalins clearly enough what the authors did. Though, the part of "Why" the authors did what they did isn't elaborated with much depth. From the authors perspective, the articles seems exhaustive and comprehensive, but for a person reviewing the article, who doesn't have much background of the problem at hand, the article make it tough to decipher why certain program is written the way it is.

problem The writeup does talk about the changes and why the authors did it that way.   Rather than pasting the code (without any indentation) in the wiki page, the authors could have pasted screenshots of the code! This might have made it easier to comprehend.    
problem The writeup does not talk about the functionalities . However they include what is missing and what they will include.

problem The writeup does not have a test plan or any related info on why it is not covered.
problem The writeup does not explain the changes. Also the wiki page is not elaborative about the changes made
problem The writeup does emphasize on how the issues are resolved, however lacks a reasoning as to why did they choose it.  Suggestion: It is hard to follow the code, as there is lack of comments. You can try to include meaningful comments for every function you have introduced. That will increase code readability
problem the writeup does bot explain how and why the authors did the work the way they did.
problem The writeup clearly explains the project- a single rejoinder per team for reviews, but does not explicitly say the advantages of having such a system. On the other hand the authors do justify the need to fix navigation issues for giving feedback to reviewers as it results in a user-friendly UI. The modification to summary report to accommodate collective feedback is logical and directly implied if the main problem statement of single rejoinder per team is properly justified.
problem The writeup clearly explains the implementation details and why those changes were made. It is nicely articulated and leaves no ambiguity.
problem The writeup clearly explained the need for the off screen canvas API; however, the explanation of how the feature was implemented was too shallow. What is in those .rs files?
problem The writeup clearly explain why the team did the work that they did. Good job on that. The only thing I may have preffered to have as a reviwer is a detailed step by step instruction on how to view the changes made by the team in the app. This could be added in the wiki, or a short screencast could me made to help follow the steps.
problem The writeup can be improved to begin with a short description of the project backgound so that anyone reading the writeup can understand what the project is all about.
problem The writers have explained what they did in the project and how they did it. But, I could not find a 'why'. No reason behind the approach is specified.

problem The write-ups been written well. A small suggestion to the team would be to explain their solutions in more detail as it would better the understanding of what the project does. Also the team could use code snippets instead of screenshots of the code.

problem The write-up was very good, in the sense that it mentioned the high level view of the tasks first, and then dug deeper under the hood. But, it only showed what files they changed, and what it produced as a result. They could have also shown what is that they changed, or provided a link in the wiki. Yes, one can deduce that from the pull request too, but having a link or the content itself on the wiki is a big boon.

problem The write-up was good and clearly explains the issues faced and the code changed. It would have been much more clear if screenshots of git file changed were posted. 
problem The write-up only tells what is to be done and how it is done. The rational behind choosing the approach is not mentioned, neither are any of the principles mentioned. It has comparisons between the previous and new versions and why they made they made the necessary modifications.
problem The write-up mentions the function of each section of the relevant code, however it is not clear what the changes made to the code are.
problem The write-up lacks screenshots/ relevant images/ screencast to explain the workflow of the project. This would increase the readability of the wikipage. Also, the team has added testplan and included description for the code presented in the wiki. These points were mentioned during the previous review which were picked up by the team. The team has done a good work in improving their writeup as compared to the previous version.

problem The write-up is well written and looks through. The write-up details what has been accomplished and there are plenty of screenshots to support this. However, there is no mention of what code has been changed/added and why the authors chose this change.  Test plan has also been well written. The parts written are well written, but there's a good scope of improvement.

problem The write-up is very well written and documented. It is aided well with the the help of screenshots and proper labelling. The only small thing that I would like to suggest is the steps to reproduce or something similar so that the person not familiar with the expertiza can also reach to the desired place.
problem The write-up is very self explanatory. It successfully covers each and every aspect of the work done by the team, and also, to an extend, delvers what mindset they had while working o the project, which is very great. Just one sugestion is that, instead of simply dumping the files, they could have made a quick note of what the code in the file does. No one want to go through each and every line of code just to get an idea what it is meant to be.

problem The write-up is pretty ambiguous and feels all cluttered up. Maybe elaborating on few lines and separating the one whole paragraph into bullet points under different headings would have made it more readable and clear.
problem The write-up is good, but it doesn't feel much refined or improvised after the initial edit. As mentioned above, the image isn't visible clearly, which means that it wasn't reviewed much after posting. But apart frm that, the flow of the write-up is very effective, in fact one of the best that I've reviewed. The concept of giving a higher lvel view, and then diving deeper into the implementation is very subtly applied.
problem The write-up is difficult to follow, and doesn't provide much insight into how the testing code works. Despite having a test plan section, no test plan is included.

problem The write-up gave a good introduction to the project by providing the background information about the Servo parallel web-engine project by Mozilla for web page rendering and Rust programming language to execute HTML5 and CSS3 parsers. It then highlighted the OffscreenCanvas API that can be used to generate frames and also return the rendered image using the transferToImageBitmap() method. The writeup covered how web workers can be used to implement OffscreenCanvas API to render images as an independent process isolated from the webpage. The problem statement of of creating OffscreenCanvas and OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2d interfaces with OffscreenCanvas Constructor, properties (width and height) and getContext() method was defined. The use of Web IDL to describe interfaces for web browsers was briefed and that was followed by the code flow and the code snippet of the two Web IDL files namely- OffScreenCanvas.webidl and OffScreenCanvasRenderingContext2D.webidl While the write-up was cogent and clearly explained the work done, it could have elaborated on the implementation of the methods like transferToImageBitmap() and how the interface is integrated into the system to render images in a webpage using an isolated web worker.
problem The write-up does not include a test plan section. If a test section had been included then the different scenarios, pre-conditions, edge cases and invalid input values would have been dealt.
problem The write-up did cover about the efficiency of Servo to render webpages quickly and smoothly when compared to Mozilla's other rendering engines. Servo does this using parallel layout, styling, web-renders and constellation and in turn sandboxes the processes, threads and tasks that allows the browser to fail better, hence making it more robust and secure. It justified the use of Rust to rewrite C++ and effectively the browser as well. 
problem The write-up contains the information about how the solution was achieved. The details about why the solution was implemented in this way is currently missing from the documentation. The team should include the same in the documentation as well.

problem The write up was well explained. Test cases were with images of test cases in the UI. The code could have a github screenshot or the link to the changed file for more clarity.
problem The write up starts with introduction about Expertiza, Test Driven Development and Unit Testing. It then moves over to describing the problem statement, team members, test plan and implementation that contains detailed documentation on the procedure to set up the Expertiza environment, functionalities of Menu model, sample views , declaration of mock objects as test entries and finally the conditions tested on each of the method of the Node and Menu class. The various methods tested on the Node class include initialize, setup, site_controller, controller_action, content_page and add_child. Similarly the methods tested on the Menu class include initialize, select, get_item, get_menu, selected, selected? and crumbs.  The write up also includes the screenshot of the Rspec tests that were run. The screenshot of the SimpleCov coverage report is blurred and not readable.  The write up ends with concluding remarks, learning outcomes and References. Overall, the documentation was very precise and clear with all the information needed to understand the code on Github. The authors could have included and highlighted how to run the Rspec code since their project specifically deals with unit testing. Another apparent issue that I can point out is the quality of screenshot.
problem The write up is written adequately. Only thing is to reduce the code shown on the wiki page as I feel that it might be irrelevant to have the whole code increasing the reading page size.

problem The write up is well documented. There is a clear flow from the code change part to the screenshots of the implementation. It would have been better if there was a screenshot of the code from git or a link to git so that the code changes would have been more defined as per the green and red colour. Also, the code change could be explained more.
problem The write up is very well detailed with good information and pictures. Two things: 1. Put the write up on the expertiza wiki page instead of in a word document 2. On the wiki use the   tag to insert code snippets into the page instead of a screenshot of the code
problem The write up is simple and understandable. It starts off by describing about Expertiza, motivation behind the project, the tasks to do, list of classes that are modified and impacted by the change. I like how the authors have screenshots of both the existing code that is removed and the new code that is added in the pull request, which juxtaposes them and highlights the tasks in the problem statement and goals of the project. The write up then ends with the test plan which lists the test cases handled.
problem The write up is short and to the point, it could have been formatted and arranged in a better way.
problem The write up is okay but could be a bit more descriptive. Could have provided screen shots of the changes to help reader understand better. No initial instructions on where to get started.
problem The write up is lacking screenshots, for example, the colour coded views etc and the test plan to verify the issues. Only the test plan for colour coding has been mentioned. The issues and the plan of action have been described properly.

problem The write up has not been formatted well, most of it consists of what can already be read from the OSS assignment specifications document. I would strongly suggest the team to include screenshots of their commits instead of using wiki code formatting.

problem The write up could've been organized in a better manner and the authors could've given more attention to detail. For example, I see they mention the project E1791 but without a hyperlink, it was a little difficult to reach the documentation of that project (the search bar didn't help matters too). It could've been stated more clearly what requirement the earlier project implemented, and what improvement this one does. Also, the document does not cover testing - even some basic test cases. (A little formatting inconsistency - the heading "Flowchart" always has a colon attached to it but none of the other headings do!)

problem The write up as well done. However, the write-up is missing the test plan. 
problem The write up addresses details of all the three problem statements along with the code changes done in every file and the files added. The team has also added screenshots of the manual testing.
problem The write is well-organized and clear in its material. The authors have improved the write-up by explaining what each newly defined functions work. and added code snippets wherever necessary.  However, the test plan is still missing from the write-up.
problem The write has only details of team members and files changed. Out of the two files mentioned , only one is currently committed in git(vm_question_response.rb) is missing. May be a commit issue.
problem The wirteup is pretty good. It gives the test plan and all the test cases. Also, there is explanation of the test process and logic. Just one minor problem.  The 29 tests provide 100% coverage of the lines in menu.rb. Before the project the coverage was only It is an incomplete sentence.
problem The wireframes themselves make the project self-explanatory. That being said, enough explanation about how the team will tackle the problem statement has been given. Things like what API will be used to achieve the objective has been mentioned. No suggestions.
problem The wiki talk about what they have done throughly, it could be better if they have mention about how they do that.

According to the wiki, I can get a clear insight about what the project is, what's the issues include in it, why the team do things as the way they said and the tests they give to make sure the functions work properly. However, the description for the first issue is not very clear and makes me confusing.

problem The wiki page is divided into some great sections that provide details about the project. I appreciate that the team provided actual code snipits along with explanation of the test to afford the reader a deeper understanding. The first paragraph in the design section is a bit hard to follow. It would be helpful to have this explanation accompanied by the tests these stubs were associated with and/or the actual implementation of these stubs for a better grasp of their purpose. I would recommend combining the test and design sections for a easier flow of reading and following test implementations. Thank you for the Results section of the wiki that wraps up the project and is an easy point of reference for the reader to see the outcome of the project. 
problem The wiki looks too long with a lot of code. It does have all the code and test cases, but its better to have git links to each code and more explanation of the code used above it in the wiki. This will help the readers to compare the changes in the code with the explanation parallelly.

problem The Wiki is great, but I believe it's better to move the Testing framework part to front of the page.
problem The wiki is detailed enough that it mentions all the functionalities required in the project. The team has made sure to explain all the changes they wish to make to the system. They list all columns that need to be sorted and how they will implement the sorting.
problem The Wiki is descriptive and covers the essentials of the project. In my opinion, I think the code for every test is not required. It is enough to explain the structure and code for one test, maybe and what each test is supposed to do for the rest of the tests. That should suffice.

For example, test plan lists all the test cases and code, which according to me should be covered in the implementation.

problem The wiki explains the problem statement very well along with the proposed solution which seems reasonable. But the wiki does not include any test plans as of now. There are a few test cases which can be used to write the test plan, for eg. not adding drop deadline for the assignment itself and assigning each topic a drop deadline and check the behaviour of the system.
problem The wiki does not include any discussions about design principles or patterns that were used in the project.  One thing that stands out in the code is that every mock object is defined at the start of the file. The team could provide a rationale for this decision and why it is superior to for example using different mocks for each separate test suite.

problem The wiki documentation has been updated. All the information has been documented in a neat and logical manner. The write up adequately provides what functionality the work is related to. They havent updated any part of the wiki documentation but overall their documentation is concise and to the point.

problem The wiki defines the primary goal of the project but it does not contain a discussion about the plan or strategy that is utilized to solve the problem. Raw code is copied from review_response_map.rb and review_response_map_spec.rb files, however this does not give the reader any useful information.  I would suggest replacing the review_response_map.rb code with a short description of what the team needed to understand about the given code in order to write the test suite. Furthermore, the team can provide a listing of higher level method descriptions from review_response_map_spec.rb, what are the expectations and which mock objects are being used to achieve the result. One minor improvement would be removing parts like Expertiza description (http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/index.php/CSC/ECE_517_Fall_2018/E1850._Write_unit_tests_for_review_response_map.rb#Background) because it is redundant in this context.

problem The wiki could have been organized better. It looks a little messy. Not self explanatory. The Use case does not have any actors in it. Suggestion: Code screenshots could have been placed better
problem The wiki clearly defines the primary objective of the project and justifies the reasoning behind introduction of additional helper constructs like participant factory. The authors complement the descriptions of each test case with associated block of code and elaborate on the details of their inner workings. I would suggest removing parts like high level descriptions of Expertiza and Unit Tests (http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/index.php/OSS_E1852.rb#Unit_Test_Description) because they are redundant in this context.
problem The whole wiki page is complete and neat, while it might be easier to understand if they reorder the test plan with other parts of the page.
problem The website is not up yet. I looked through the code. Looks like there are still some functionalities not implemented.

problem The visuals are very helpful. More clear view of how delegation pattern is being used would have been appreciable.
problem The visualizations help a bit alongside the descriptions, but aren't really useful for conveying information.
problem The visualization includes a screen mock-up "Analyze"  button which will implement the algorithm and produce the output. However, there is no mock-up of the screen of what will the output be like. The flow diagram is highly redundant according to me, as it does not portray any additional information about the design. I would suggest them to provide a sequence diagram of the algorithm methods, so as to illustrate their changes.

problem The visualization clearly conveys the high-level goals of the project. It does not explain the design in detail, however.
problem The visualization aids used currently are application flow diagram, and use cases. They are useful to understand the scenario of the problem statement. However, a sequence or a communication diagram will really be beneficial to understand how the method interfaces with the other  methods. This will help identify if the new method impacts other functionalities and will portray the proposed solution efficiently.
problem The visualization aids used are class diagram for the strategy pattern, use-cases to explain the test plan. The class diagram is very useful to illustrate the approach used by the team, and it succeeds in explaining. They have made changes according to the suggestion provided in the previous review. A sequence diagram will help understand the flow of the methods from one controller to the other, as the design suggests so.

problem The View Inquiries link takes you to the wrong page. Users can't view nor edit their profile. There isn't (as far as I can tell) any way to post a house as a realtor.
problem The view file contain 200 more files so it is quite difficult to figure out the structure of the View. It is better if independent component is introduced to construct the whole task view. And the commits contain the Gemfile, which is considered not secure to deploy for it alters the production environment.

problem The video shows all the test cases pass, but I'm skeptical that they got all the corner cases. Looking at the review_response_map.rb model, there are a lot of methods which aren't explicitly tested.

problem The variables, methods, and class names do seem to follow proper convention and are suggestive of the functionality they are being used for. In some cases they could have used a liitle more desciptive names for variables for example inside app/helpers/student_task_helper.rb  they could have used background_colour instead of rtn as a variable name in the due_date_color() method. It will become more readable for the reviewers to understand the functionalities.

problem The User Interface was working as described in the README file.  The UI functionality don't have any issues apart from the one noted in additional comments If team would have given some assets/stylesheets config,  The UI would have been great on the looks as well
problem The user interface looks pretty, is clean and intuitive. But the placement of menu buttons was rather "not-obvious". It took time for me to figure out login / signup buttons, and I also had to actively look for buttons to perform actions after signing-in, which isn't actually much user friendly. Though it may seemed cliche, but I think it is very user-friendly to have action buttons on the content of the web-page, rather than having them at the top inside the header. But apart from that, the simplicity and the look and feel was pretty good.
problem The user interface lack multiple navigation functionalities such as it does have any cancel or back button. So, if a user tries to move back or cancel while creating a company, he would be stuck and would not be able to move to any other tab.
problem The user interface is very well designed, and the cleanest and the most user friendly among all that I've reviewed till now. The UI is very intuitive and the alternate shading of the lists improves legibility a lot. The only place where the UI was deficient was that it didn't seem consistent. The login / signup page had a different UI compared to other pages. I suppose improving consistency would increase user friendliness of the application to a lot of extent. 
problem The user interface is very simple, clear and straightforward. But it lacks depth where it should have been extensive. For example, after signing up for the first time, the user is directed by to the login page to login again. This is not very user friendly, and is rather redundant. One must automatically sign in after creating an account. Also, the application should deduce whether I'm a realtor or a househunter or an admin from the email ID i entered. I should atleast now have to specify for househunter or realtor about my role.
problem The user interface is very pimitive. The team could have done much more. They have not designed it very well. Although I was not looking for graphics, but the element placement could have been much more improved. 
problem The User Interface is very intuitive. The idea to add a field for preferred contact is very smart and relevant. Displaying the number of registered users, however, seems irrelevant to the house hunter and realtor. Perhaps this can be a function of the admin account where it would be more relevant.
problem The user interface is very intuitive. I like the modern look and feel of the UI as well as the icons and images. It's quite professional. Excellent work! The various buttons are in good locations. The button text could be darker, however. The "new user" link could be made into a bigger button, which would make it more prominent. Right now it is hard to see.
problem The user interface is very confusing. It is difficult to get to the sign up page to begin with, and then the messages Isrealtor and Ishousehunter are cryptic to actual users (anyone other than computer scientists). It is very difficult to follow where the links take you on the website and what exactly you are looking at at any given moment.
problem The User interface is very appealing. The show view is especially remarkable that makes good use of the attractive classes of CSS and Bootstrap. The navigation links provided in every page are very helpful to explore the website. The switch user capability makes it easy for users to switch between roles without the hassle of logging out and logging in again. One issue that I encountered was that the inquiries controller has not been fully implemented, which lands the website into an error page. 
problem The user interface is pretty intuitive. Few things like the create house functionality is breaking on heroku and giving an application error.
problem The user interface is pretty intuitive. Few things like the create house functionality is breaking on heroku and giving an application error.
problem The user interface is nice. I suggest you move the search button in the houses screen to the left. Also, "yes" and "no" would probably be more user-friendly than "true" and "false" for the basement condition. The new user window was very intuitive and powerful. Note: I found a bug in this window: changing the admin account with "REALTOR" checked causes an error. The error screen was graceful, however. Also, please use radio buttons for "HUNTER" or "REALTOR", not checkboxes. Please also include the type of the user in the users window.
problem The user interface is done as it would be in a basic ruby application, which is good. There is no login functionality, this is mentioned in the README which was helpful. Some functionalities which could be improved are : 1)     1)  When I try to add a new house hunter from admin, I get a Contact Method is not included in the list error. As a user, I dont know what kind of values your system is expecting in this field, so it might help to probably provide a dropdown selection element and put in your values there. In this way, the user will always select a value which your system is expecting. If there are a finite number of values, you can just hard code them into the html element, else pick it up from the db and populate your dropdown as such. 2)      2) When I click on back from the new househunter url, I am directed to show all house hunters url. You could improve this by updating the link-to for this back button by providing it with the user_url, or you could detect which is the current user logged in (Realtor/House Hunter/ Admin) and accordingly redirect to that roles home page url.
problem The user interface is average.  The good parts I found about UI are: 1. Error messages (while registering a new admin/house hunter/realtor/house/company) were helpful. 2. Front-end checks like mail and phone number size and type etc have been used properly. 3. Dropdown for companies while registering houses, for houses while submitting inquiruies etc are properly implemented and easy to use. However, several very small changes would make the UI much better: 1. Allow a drop-down when signing up as roles 2. Add inquire a house or add a new house to interest list etc functionalituies at the top. If house list gets a few hundred rows long, user must scroll all the way down to access the functionalities. 3. Add message as to why login failed. Something as simple as "Invalid credentials" would suffice and let user know that the login is working but the password is incorrect.

problem The user interface has a very basic look and feel. The sign up links being on every page is not ideal. There should only be a log out link. Also, the company in the realtor page is showing the id, not the company's name. I suggest you use a drop down menu for the preferred contact of the house hunter who is signing up. It would be much more intuitive to have a single sign-in page for all users. There were also missing back buttons.

problem The user interface has a bare bones look and feel but is intuitive overall. The inquiries list is hard to find for the admin, and the links below the tables could be placed at the top of the screen to improve the UX. The inquiry component of the app had awkward navigation, particularly for the realtor. This is also awkward for the house hunter. Only one link is needed up top.

problem The use of jQuery plugin sounds simple and easy to use.
problem The use of flowcharts describe the functioning of the project exceptionally. Suggestion: Including screen mockups to your doc will add more weight to it.
problem The use of active record is missing from the application. There are no foreign key relationships in the schema. Although the relationship are maintained in the model file. A separate database is created for admin/realtor/hunter which will store a lot of redundant data. There is no database for storing the response of inquiries. According to the db design , a house belongs to both a company and a realtor directly which is not correct.

problem The use case diagram appears to be slightly incorrect. The symbol for an should be a stick figure not a rectangle. But that is a minor error. Also, the Use Case Diagram Details mention student as an actor but the diagram shows no instance of student as an actor. I think the Student as an actor shouldn't be included because in the current use case only the instructor is the primary actor and the assignment should have been submitted by the time the instructor views the scores, thus, requiring no involvement from the students at that point in time.Mention of Primary sequence in the Use Case Diagram Details seems highly unnecessary and potentially unrelated.

problem The travis test had failed and codeclimate shows indentation and other such minor errors. I think that the team just needs to work on the styling and following some Ruby guidelines and they are good to go.

problem The topic assigned to this team is Unit testing on menu.rb. So, they had to create Rspec tests for the methods in the model file menu.rb in the new file spec/models/menu_spec.rb. The team has precisely tested the functionalities of every method including all relevant scenarios (as contexts) of both the nested class Node and the enclosing class Menu. The names used for mock objects and literals are intuitive and follow the Ruby's convention. There were a few issues regarding incorrect indentation and the verbosity of the spec code in the previous round. The team has rectified those in this round. In my view, giving additional comments for code in rspec is superfluous as the tests are already embedded with information on what it intends to do through the use of 'describe', 'context' and 'it' methods.  The code is DRY through the use of reusable mock objects like menu, nodes, site controllers, content pages, controller actions, items and roles which span across the entire block where it is defined. Additionally, the use of before(:each) method to initialize and set up these objects further DRY's up the spec for the methods. 
problem The tests were mentioned in the report but not in the pull request. There was also no coverage information. The approach looks good though.

problem The tests look detailed and clear. However no edge cases or failing cases are tried. Simple and straightforward  tests are implemented. They could have tried more corner scenarios more..eg. fields are missing etc
problem The tests have been added as per the test plan but some of them have not seemed to have passed. The team could have a look at the tests not passing and work on them.
problem the tests given tests there changes, which is enough.
problem The tests for the controllers and models were basic scaffold tests with not much meaning.
problem The tests describe the code they are testing not the behavior/functionality. Like for "In this scenario, the controller_action attribute of the menu item is unavailable. In this case, the expectation is that a customized path is assigned to the URL variable." This just specifies what variable is being updated and I have no idea what workflow it represents. This is at least a brittle description for a test. Suppose tomorrow the variable is removed or some function ends up calculating the value, while the test it self might pass if the change was passive, the description is now stale and will confuse any user trying to update the tests. 
problem The testing was thorough, although one model and one controller individually did not appear to be tested thoroughly.
problem The testing was incomplete, the model and controller were not thoroughly tested.
problem The testing plan is very neat and comprehensive.  they could have handled more edge cases.

problem The testing of initialize is very well described with descriptions of how and why the tests were written in that particular fashion. However, all other tests are not discussed. When looking at the github it seems that there were many more tests that were not elaborated upon. The test descriptions were included at the bottom of the page but without explanation of implementation or purpose. It would be helpful to include more of the test cases. If anything, it would be a good idea to discuss them without the code inclusion like that of initialize because that section of the wiki is very well presented.
problem The test works well, but there is no edge case.
problem The test section looks inadequate as of now, only two test scenarios are mentioned and no details on automation or UI.  More so no mention of tests in the document.

problem The test scripts have been written, however the scripts could have been written in a more elaborate way to include all the test cases and not just the high level tests. For example, the system accepts an Invalid phone number which is less than 10 digits of length. All these test cases could have been written and tested

problem The test plan should have come before the implementation details. I gave this suggestion in my previous review as well. Still, the documentation is well written overall. It's just a puzzling choice to put the test plan near the end.
problem The test plan seems to include examples of tests and the explanation of the same. However, I didn't find any description of edge cases or invalid input values.

problem The test plan seems to be fine. It basically outlines all the functionalities that the team will test. The different cases the team will test is also outlined though not many. I guess there will be more test cases to be added once the project is on the roll.

problem The Test plan seems to be covering most of the positive test cases. However, it doesn't seem to cover any negative test cases. Like if the student decides not to make the review public, its reviews shouldn't be shown to the TA/ Instructor.
problem The test plan seems overly simplistic. It only tests whether the team's changes work in the most drastic scenario possible. It seems like they should have more boundary value tests and more test cases to account for their new method of looping through the reviews to compare new reviews with previous ones.

problem The test plan section unfortunately lists no concrete test that the team would write. Checking the functionality manually, and writing rspec tests for the code written are extremely different, and I would suggest the team to have a dedicated test plan section, mentioning the controller/model they wish to test, the objects they would need to mock etc.

problem The test plan section just states that the existing test cases for feedback per member is fixed to satisfy the new feedback per team implementation. It would have been effective if specific pre-conditions, edge cases, invalid input values etc are handled. For example, in this case the input with missing team id or one member teams can be used as good candidates to test the implementation.

problem The test plan is present. It is broken down into separate sections for each of the five issues. Each section is further broken down into a manual and automated testing parts. While the sections for manual testing are comprehensive, the sections for automated tests are too general and do not provide a clear vision for what types of changes are going to be introduced. I would suggest elaborating more on the technical side of the tests, for example specifying which spec files will be modified or whether or not the project will utilize RSpec.

problem The Test Plan is not defined formally in the wiki. Instead the reader has to reason about the provided code itself. Given test suite covers every method of the object under test. ~70% Coverage is achieved. It would be better for the team to define the test plan and decouple it from the actual code. This could be done by firstly stating all the 'describe' constructs, methods that they are testing and secondly, elaborating by listing their descriptions.

problem The test cases are cleanly written following good practices. Some of the indentation needs to be adjusted to contain better readability. Also, within the menu_rpec file, you are essentially testing two classes Node and Menu. I am not sure why that is. Is the node class and inner class of menu? Maybe these two classes should be separated into different rspec files to ensure a better naming setup. Maybe this could be clarified in the wiki so that readers would understand the design choice. Overall great work.

problem The team was regular in committing changes. The team continued to work in round 2 and made regular progress. All members contributed significantly. Great job! Could have started the project a bit earlier.
problem The team vastly improved on the writeup from the first stage by giving a general overview of the tasks taken up and the list of issues present and resolved during the project. 
problem The team states all the problems included in this project and provide the solutions for them. However, the authors didn't provide enough introduction about what the project is. The problems was not explained clear enough and tough to understand. No test plan provided.

problem The team should give more comments for the review strategy part, especially for the ruby codes part to help viewers understand what is going on.
problem The team should add more comments for the codes include in the two issues, it is a little bit hard to follow what the author want to do without comments.

problem The team seems to have tested the login / signup module pretty well. I could hardly find any bugs there. But the team seemed to have ignored testing other modules extensively. This is because the delete functionality in many modules is not working. For example, the realtor cannot delete houses or company, neither can a house hunter delete houses from his interest list.
problem The team provides some test cases, but it seems the tests were all done themselves and they didn't write codes for it and make it automatic. The test shows the feature work properly.
problem The team provided sufficient information on the project purpose and design. The test plan is adequate.     It would be better, to provide a solid reasoning for incorporating different sorting. Few sorting implementations, ie) by name and team are intuitive. But the need to sort the Author feedback report and teammate review report, in the way suggested by the team, the reasoning is not very apparent. Need more problem statement elaboration.

problem The team only implemented 2/3 parts of the project and has not created the tests for the same. The CI build is also failing for the pull request. The functionalities implemented are working as expected. 
problem The team needs to provide a list of sections including the test plan and unit test cases that would make it easy to refer to the pull request and the github code. They must also work on designing the wiki page making it easy to read and understand it.
problem The team might has out 2 issues to be resolved.
problem The team kept on committing on the regular bases but needed team collaboration. Mostly commits are from one person.

problem The team have thoroughly explained the changes that need to be made and how they intend to make those changes.
problem The team have taken time to explain each functionality properly in the second round. They list all the changes that they wish to make in the views. However, I would suggest the team to also mark out (circle out) the area they wish to change in the screenshot of the view.
problem The team have suggested reasonable changes to address the problem statement but have not given explanation for each solution they have proposed for the implementation.

problem The team have included helpful diagrams but I feel the team could have included diagrams that better helped us in understanding what the team are planning to implement. The current diagrams show us what Expertiza looks right now and that's it.
problem The team have explained why and how they did the work they did. Feel they should elaborate more on the tests that they have implemented.
problem the team have explained the flow of models using data flow diagram and have explained the use case using the use case diagrams. some more designs regarding the approach of implementation can be added in the documentations such as sequence diagrams/class diagrams for new classes/modified classes.

problem The team has written a well structured write-up, but it lacks depth in certain areas. There is need for more background on what an author feedback is. The project description gives a better idea. Please try to include details from there. The last sentence under the 'Motivation' head, "You should change this to list the teams collective feedback to its reviewers to a particular assignment" is a bit confusing. Please rephrase the sentence so as to add clarity to it.    Instructions on how to manually test the functionality is missing. It was difficult to figure out how to navigate to and test the functionality. It would be really helpful to add this in the wiki.
problem The team has written a concise and efficient code with proper implementation. However, some additional comments in some parts would improve the readability and make it easier to comprehend

problem The team has worked on improving the wiki document. The writeup now includes the Test plan section  that was suggested in the first round specifying the how the team setup an expertiza environment, the model functions used and the mock instance built for testing the model file. 
problem The team has worked on achieving the path coverage by taking the edge cases into consideration. But, as most of the builds have failed, it may need a working deployment for it to being deployed on the server.
problem The team has well explained what are they going to change. Though I didn't get how are they going to do the proposed changes. Since they are going to introduce a new feature, they have focussed more on explaining how to use the new feature.

problem The team has well explained the problem statement along with the application flow which makes it easier to understand about the project. They has also described the method which discusses their proposed implementation. However, it would be helpful to add more details on the design approach they have chosen. The team has also proposed a short test plan on a very high level, which makes senses as this is very early level of the project, but its suggested to add more diverse test cases to it as it would help in handling all the cases during the development of functionality of  self review extension.

problem The team has uploaded manual testing screencast to show fixes for 2 out of 3 issues to be fixed, and everything works as expected. The audio in the screencast helps clearly understand the before and after scenarios. However, there are no corresponding test cases to test the fixes. No changes have been done to the spec file.
problem The team has tried implementing a lot of functionalities as per the code. However, the below ones does not work: >The admin cannot view or delete the inquiries made by house hunter. > While trying to logout as an admin the application breaks. > The realtor cannot edit the information. > While realtor tries to add/view houses the application breaks.   >While trying to view the houses as an admin the application breaks.

problem The team has tested controller but not model. 
problem The team has tested both a model and controller. The system can handle the following cases 1)when user uses same email to register twice.  2)should not save user with password less than 6 chars. 3)should not save user with invalid email 4)should not save user without email
problem The team has suggested reasonable changes to address the problem statement but have not included any details. The team should elaborate on the implementation they plan to do.
problem The team has suggested 2 methods to test. The first and the recommended method is using the existing automated tests for OffScreenCanvas feature. A new offscreen-canvas directory was added to tests and a new .ini file enables the new preference. The second approach is writing own test cases and a sample HTML file can be used to test if the OffscreenCanvas is rendered.
problem The team has submitted a partial design and the part they have thought about is complete. The rest has not been thought through. Please consider the design for the logic necessary to show/hide the reviews for the students.
problem The team has stated all the changes they are planning to make step wise in detail. This really helps to understand the approach they are taking in simple terms. However, the team has not stated which design principle they are following.
problem The team has separated the existing methods of a class in 2 sub classes. They have used meaningful names for same. The team has not added any new functions as per the wiki description.
problem The team has represented the workflow through the UML diagrams which is very helpful to understand the flow of the requirement with multiple actors involved in the system. However, it would have been more helpful if they could add the design flow diagrams to explain the database design changes they are suggesting to be done. The new table they are suggesting to make and  the fields they would map to could be shown through a entity relationship diagram which will make it easy for the end user to understand the attributes and the relationship of different entities involved due to the functionality change.
problem The team has put a lot of efforts in writing the tests. However, the Travis CI tests are not passing.
problem The team has pushed almost all the commits on 2-3 days of the entire cycle, not regular. Also, the commits are made by one person, which seems strange to me.
problem The team has provided the application flow diagram which helps to understand the working of the project. It would be helpful to add design details and the diagram for same so that others can understand the implementation as well.

problem The team has provided solutions for all the issue but one. For issue#1017, the team has only provided a flow chart(description of the issue graphically) but the code which needs to be changed/added should be looked upon.    Suggestion: The team can mention the way in which they attempt to tackle the issue by mentioning the files and the logic behind the proposed solution.
problem The team has provided screenshots to help understand the changes in the UI that need to be reflected. Moreover, the team has included proper steps in which every task is achieved.
problem The team has provided enough explanation about how they are going to work on this project. Overall quality of explanation is good.  Suggestion: Include the purpose of implementing these functions/changes.
problem The team has provided current system UI, but no expectations on the UI for this project. For an UI intensive project, I believe its essential to have at least a minimal wireframe that serves as the base for good design document so every stake-holder can be on the same page with regard to expectations.
problem The team has provided an excellent write-up with proper explanation of the problem statement and the solutions they have provided. The team has also included  a video which make things really easy to understand. The team has shown navigation structure of the expertiza menu, which makes the workflow clear.
problem The team has provided a flowchart to explain the changes that they have made to the system. They have also provided screenshots of the UI that needs to be improved. This makes the design document readable and easy to understand. 
problem The team has proposed many changes. Although, it is not clear which approach or what exact changes they plan to make.

problem The team has proposed a prototype where in the code might have some kinds of sorting of data. I hope the code for this does not violate the DRY principle in any case.
problem The team has only made one significant change to the following file: app/controllers/assignments_controller.rb . It is an if statement which is difficult to follow since the team has not written any comments for the same.   Suggestion: The team could add comments and screenshots for better understand of the workflow in the second submission

problem The team has only fixed one issue related to selection of questionnaires according to the video. The other part of the problem statement is missing. The application could not be tested as the application is not deployed. 
problem The team has not yet started to test their models (unit test) and controller (functional and integration test). Test driven development (TDD) is a good strategy to test the application features before and during the application development phase. By using TDD, it is possible to anticipate the potential pit falls and corner cases, before starting to address the code to tackle those.
problem The team has not written many test cases to thoroughly tested one model and one controller.
problem The team has not written any test cases for the entities. There are only the default test cases.

problem The team has not provided steps for manual testing even though this was requested during round 1 review.
problem The team has not provided any visual representation of the work they propose to do. Perhaps the pseudocode mentioned above, could instead be shown as a set of diagrams showing an example for how this fucntionality would be handled when one say 1 Review has a score disparity of more than the threshold for existing 2-3 reviews. The idea here is not to add working screenshots, but a Low-Fi diagram would also help in making the documentation visually more representative.

The team could improve this by adding a screenshot of the updated workflow below the changes shown in the writeup
problem the team has mentioned all the files that will be changed and have also written a paragraph stating what are the proposed changes. The team could also document the changes that are being made to individual code files stating the changes done using code snippets and the reason why the changes are being made. Also they can talk about what design patterns principle are being used to incorporate the functionality that is being proposed. The team could also use CRC cards to depict the proposed code changes. This will not only help readers understand the report better but also help the team in dividing work between the team members and fast tracking the completion of project.
problem The team has made two commits since the first review. The issues that were covered were '#scores' block and mock instance handling. However, the primary problem that the spec is testing an instance of AssignmentParticipant class instead of Participant was not addressed.

problem The team has made sure to write the relevant test cases wherever possible. But the overall coverage has decreased. In my opinion the newly added test cases cover more or less the entire range of this project. But I think that they need to focus a bit more on the test casses.
problem the team has made great improvement as compared to the last submission. The new code added has no bad names, long or complicated functions but there is lack of comments. the heading of the write-up pages explains what the test case is doing but there should be proper commenting done in the code too.
problem The team has leveraged the existing test cases to align with the changes implemented; they have not created any test plan.
problem The team has introduced the functions clearly, but it may be better to also include the introduction of expertise itself. Besides, the motivation is general, add some specific details for this project would be better. As far as I am concerned, for the functionality of the menu, the introduction is also a little bit general. Adding more details about what the function of the menu, so we can know clearly what should be tested and if the test is enough.

problem the team has included the test plan design in the documentation. The manual and automated test scenarios are currently missing from the document.
problem The team has included the test plan design but the documentation is missing on the scenarios that will be tested after the implementation, How the team will be testing it , what are the automated test that will be created and also the manual test plan. How an end user can test the end-to- end requirements should also be a part of the design.

problem the team has included the diagrams related to current system analysis and the workflow.  A workflow explains the current design and its similarity with the existing flow used for topics biding. The team could have included some UI mock ups as well to show the views for better understanding. 
problem The team has included test plan in Connextra format by including the feature specification and two scenarios- one happy path and one to capture the edge case of response generated with no text. No more test cases can be added to check if the team's part in the project is implemented well. Some test case scenarios that check the efficiency of the suggestion detection algorithm (for example: to detect review responses that generate the generalized suggestion for all the projects) can be included.

problem The team has included a thorough testing plan but I couldn't find any commits to any of the rspec testing controllers. They could have added as per there test plan. These tests could have been included 1) Login as Instructor4. Add a new assignment Assignment_Instructor4 under the course Course 617, Spring 2016. 2) Make student6400 as the participant of that assignment and logout. using Capybara and Cucumber.
problem The team has included 2 screenshots of the review UI. The first one depicts the existing look and the 2nd one shows that they plan to include a new button that is responsible for analyzing the segmented text corresponding to each rubric where the student has reviewed and also display a pop-up message showing the results of suggestion metrics like volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics.  The team has also shown the user story in Connextra format and also described to scenarios- one happy path and one where no text is typed into the segmented text box input.  The team could have made the document even more visually palatable with flow chars / UML diagrams for Use case or Sequence diagram to support the feature and the scenarios they plan to implement.

problem The team has improved the writeup since the 1st round. The 1st round version consisted of the copied code from review_response_map.rb and review_response_map_spec.rb files. This version clearly defines each test case and in some instances elaborates on the inner workings of the blocks for example ".import" Method discussion. However, design principles and patterns that were used in this project are still missing from the writeup.  One thing that stands out in the code is that every mock object is defined at the start of the file. The team could provide a rationale for this decision and why it is superior to for example using different mocks for each separate test suite.

problem the team has implemented there testing plan and have been very thorough with there test cases. They seem to have considered a lot of cases and have implemented them in rspec. The only thing that they should do is use different commits for adding test cases.
problem The team has implemented test for the user model and controller. However, it would make for better design if they used the RSpec Framework to do the test. More comprehensive test cases could be tested such as if the passwords of the user don't match.
problem The team has implemented proper functions and has used a proper naming convention. However, there is scope to add some comments. For ex: in the new method - get_feedback_assessments_for method which will return a feedback assessment, the team could have added some comments about the logic implemented. Apart from this, the code is concise and good coding and Ruby practices have been followed

problem The team has implemented modules like: Login, signup, logout, List all companies and List all houses. However, they lack in many functionalities and under each module. So they are not properly implemented. They lack validations, session management and things like multiple same email addresses can be registered with different users.   Hence, no the team has not thoroughly tested at least one model or controller.

problem The team has implemented automated tests. There could be some addition to the test, which I have suggested above.
problem The team has heeded to the advice given in the last round and explained their tests in a more detailed manner. I do feel that the write up is well written and covers almost all the important points of the project. But I do feel images showing their tests running successfully could be added to the results part of the writeup.
problem The team has has listed the 2 files that they propose to change namely - the view- app/views/response/response.html.erb and the partial app/views/submitted_content/_self_review.html.erb. However, they could have described what these files currently do and their purpose in the documentation. The authors have embedded screenshots of how the UI of the review page will look after the Analyze button will be included. They have specified that a pop up showing the suggestion metrics pertaining to a review namely - volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics will be generated once the button is clicked.

problem The team has given a design flow that underlines the basic way in which they are planning to target the issue at hand. It can make use by giving an example as to how the output might look and the document must also describe the tools that would be used for achieving the task.
problem The team has followed Ruby coding standard. However, function names could be refactored for example the function "get_time_diff_btw_due_date_and_now" name is just too long and can be modified into "get_time_diff" or any other meaningful name. Also, it is advisable to keep the function name singular or append the name with list; so instead of using "find_participant_emails" the team can use "find_participant_email_list".
problem The team has followed good ruby coding practices. All the code is neatly written and well indented. However, the code has no comments.
problem The team has followed good coding practices with sufficient priority on MVC model. Each model/controller/view has a specific role which has not been repeated in other parts of the code.   I am giving 3/5 because 1. The code would have better readability if sufficient amount of comments are included in the code. Also, if the role of each model/controller/view is documented in the code file at the beginning then other contributors may feel easy to follow the code. 2. DRY concept can be used to a better extent.

problem The team has explicitly mentioned the classes and the name of the files where they have made changes. However, i would suggest the team to add the filenames above code snippets that they have attached in the write-up. This would make it easier for the reader to follow the workflow.
problem The team has explained the problem statement well and detailed the implementation they plan to do. Also the appropriate test cases have been included. But I feel the team should have included more explanation in their implementation.
problem The team has explained the problem statement well  and has done job in explaining the flow for every user with diagrams for them. However, the team needs to add the design approach and the testing plan for the project.
problem The team has explained the manual testing process. suggestion : include how the "Go" functionality is actually tested in ruby . Include edge cases for the testing functionality.
problem The team has explained how to fix the issues but not clear enough, it is confusing what is each pre-existing methods they have used done and why these methods were used.

problem The team has effectively worked on multiple commits, yet these suggestions need to be followed   Suggestions:   1. Commit message carries great importance for the first level of code change analysis. So this has to explain the changes to a decent extent. Commit messages in this repository is vague; if they are meaningful, it reduces some effort in analysing the code timeline.

problem The team has done well to follow the Ruby Style Guide and has ensured to keep the code DRY. However, my suggesstion is to add comments in the code for the reader to follow the code easily.
problem The team has done tremendous job in adding visualization aids. They have added application flow diagrams and visualized images. They have also included screenshots to explain the code functionality implementation of enabling self reviews and score pages. This makes the document descriptive and very easy to read and understand.  
problem The team has done great job by describing the approach and explaining same in detail by adding a pictorial representation of the pattern used. However, it would be more helpful if the team could add details about the names of the classes and the exact code changes done in the wiki page. As it would help anyone in future to understand what are the exact changes implemented. In this way the comparing code with the original code in github can be avoided.

problem The team has done a good job with the UML diagram. However, in my opinion, it would be better if they can add details for all the classes in the diagram.
problem The team has done a good job trying to show with pictures what their changes will look like in the front- end. No UML has been provided.

problem The team has done a good job in submitting changes throughout the project. The team has not committed changes in Round 2.
problem The team has done a good job in listing down the project requirements and design. However I suggest the testing plan be improved. In place of giving steps on how a reviewer should test the project, the team should instead list how they wish to write tests for the functionality added, for example-: list down a dummy set of data in any one report view, mention how they would like to write a test for this. Say using capybara, and then how to corroborate the result from the view.

problem The team has created test cases for unit testing the model file menu.rb. The test cases are meaningful and are getting passed. Once the Capybara error quoted in the 3rd rubric gets fixed, the current code can be merged into the repository. Since the team's project is unit testing and does not concern modification or augmentation of any feature, there is no question of deployment to production server.
problem The team has covered the implementation of the points given in the problem statement. However, testing of the project is necessary. This is one of the point which cold be worked on by the future team. According to codeclimate, there are 7 issues which need to be fixed as well. The future team could improve on those points.

problem The team has completed the missing code in the file oscillator_node.rs which generates different wave forms like sine, square, sawtooth and triangle. They then created the file oscillator.rs that generates objects and calls methods to run the different oscillator type examples. The code in both these Rust files have good comments that clearly explain what every snippet does and the significance of variables. This made it easy to follow the syntax and semantics of a new programming language like Rust (Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on memory safety and concurrency). The variable names used are intuitive and the code is well indented. One issue that I can point out here is that the code is lengthy and complex with a lot of redundancy; especially those that define the audio context, destination node, oscillator and a few other local variables in the file oscillator.rs are repeated for every oscillator waveform and can certainly be encapsulated in one function that can be called only once in the file.

problem The team has committed changes during round 2, though the changes haven't been spaced evenly. Most of them are close to the deadline. Also, the changes haven't even spaced evenly. The names of the commits were descriptive.
problem The team has committed changes after round one. However, there are less number of commits and are not spread throughout the life of the project. A single commit is used for various functionalities which makes it difficult to understand the exact functionality changes. The commit messages are not appropriate which makes it harder to find out what the fix is about. There are commits even after the round 2 deadline.
problem The team has clearly defined the objective of the project. The have also stated the approach that they are about to use to solve the problem. They have also clearly added the schema for storing the time information that the user will spend on a particular review. The only thing the team could have added was to create a UML diagram defining the classes that are changed or added  and adding what attributes are added and what functions modified/added. The team haven't mentioned any design pattern as such but the proposed  plan explains the idea well.

problem The team has an outline of the test plan and the test scenarios which they are planning to take care of. It would be suggested that the team takes care of all the exhaustive scenarios which are related to the functionality. They could also add the step wise description of the scenarios they have mentioned or the test cases they are planning to implement. Test driven approach makes sure our code is exhaustive of all scenarios.

problem The team has added test cases and the coverage has increased marginally for most files. However, the coverage reduced for one file which might be because a particular corner case was not tested.
problem The team has added test case for just one scenario. There is no test plan. It is advisable to add more test cases for all the methods in the sub classes to check if the existing functionality is not breaking.

problem The team has added some new commits which are about the added comments. The team has picked up the suggestion from the previous review to add comments for better readability, which is commendable.
problem The team has added screenshots on the submission page, which show that the UI is working as intended.  However, it had been more clear had they made a screencast of the same.
problem The team has added one test to check if email is sent or not. However, the coverage as I can see on Github log is not increased.
problem The team has added one spec to check whether a different directory path is generated after generation of a duplicate assignment. The overall coverage decreases by 0.6% The written test covers one of the three issues given to the team. There is scope to add some more tests
problem The team has added functionality for login through google sign-in, but I couldn't verify it's working.

problem The team has a well documented history of commits. The team has been regular in updating the github repository. The team has kept on updating the repository through both the periods of the submission. The team also has used proper commit messages to document the commit history. The readme file has also been updated regularly and contains detailed report on the functionalities associated with each user role. Also the testing information has been updated on the repository. The team could have added information on how the tests can be run . The team could have added information on how to setup the environment after cloning the repository and what all dependency information is associated with the application. The readme file could have been more structured with proper titles and paragraphs.

They could have written there testing plan in a more elaborate manner by mentioning what kind of testing frame works will be used and what functionalities will be tested. The could have also added some use cases.
problem The team has a very well documented history of commits.  The commit history seems to be well spaced over the entire period of the project development cycle. The team has commits in each of the submission periods and have kept on adding functionalities and updating documentation. The team could have updated their readme a little bit more and added information regarding all the functionalities being assigned to individual roles and how the user experience is set up. Also the team could have adde information on how to run tests in Readme.md file
problem The team has a proper concern on MVC model. Each model/controller/view has a specific role which has not been repeated in other parts of the code.   Still, I am giving 3/5 because 1. The project has neglected DRY principle in many of the instances. This has resulted in a bulkier code. 2. As many authors say, a code looks good if it appears like reading a novel. This appearance of a novel like look is missing in many places which can grab other user's attention. 3. The code would have better readability if sufficient amount of comments are included in the code. Also, if the role of each model/controller/view is documented in the code file at the beginning then other contributors may feel easy to follow the code.
problem The team had not added a link to the wiki during Round 1 of the review.  'Issues to be fixed' section seems incomplete and not the right kind of writing. Please review and try to add more details on the issues that are being addressed. Otherwise the wiki looks good with relevant diagrams and code snippets.
problem The team had added test cases in the first round of submission itself. The overall coverage has decreased by 1.04%. The test covers the logic implemented by the students.But reduces the overall coverage. The team did a good work in using Capybara and testing the web functionalities too.  
problem The team gave fixtures for the issues exist, but to make deployment, it is better to add more tests to make sure the function work properly.
problem The team gave clear explanation of what functions include in this project. Besides, they gave some examples to help us to understand how the functions work and should work in the system , so I can point out the issue easily by following their instruction.
problem The team followed good practices. No repetition of the code. DRY principles uses. How, there is an empty controller though, which is, the commons_controller.rb. What is its purpose?

problem the team does not show up any design patterms. in the wiki page, the authors did not explain how and why they did, and what I can see is just the final code for some perticular exmples.

problem The team didn't no provide the link for the deployment, but according to the video they provided, the features worked well.
problem The team did not seem to submit their changes throughout the project. The team have made changes only after round 1 and nothing on round 1. There are a total of 19 commits. It would have been better if the commits have been made with messages so that others can know what changes have been made in the project. 
problem The team did not perform any changes from the first round. No test cases were added and the coverage remained the same. The test cases from the previous round considerably fulfill the range of the project.
problem The team did not have a writeup in the last submission. In this submission, they do have a writeup with the problem statement, the files modified, approach to solving the problems, and test plan. This seems to be a significant improvement from the last submission. As for the screencast links, I think one link is absent and the other one is a YouTube video of the same project submitted last year. Please check this, I think you have added the wrong link. I would also suggest that a references section needs to be added to the Wiki page so that the deployment, pull request and other project reference links are shown.
problem The team did not commit their changes throughout the project period. The changes were committed in round 2.
problem The team did not attach the link for the github repo along with the other files submitted. This makes it difficult to comment upon the commits made. However, from the video link it can be seen that the test cases have improved to give a full path coverage.

problem The team did not add any test cases.  The coverage did not increase as a result of that.  Suggestion: Unit test cases should have been written as a part of the final deliverable.
problem The team did not add any test cases since they had achieved a 100% coverage in the first round itself. However, certain changes made to the test cases included using proper naming conventions for attributes and following the DRY principle effectively throughout the model file.
problem The team did change the project as there are 2 new commits. The CI build is still failing .
problem The team did a good job in explaining the problem statements for each issue and providing their proposed solutions. The purpose of the project is clear from the document as is a composite of several independent issues. The problem is that testing plan is missing from the project. I would suggest starting from the most basic test cases that check the functionality (e.g. one spec per issue) and then elaborating from there. Moreover, while fixing some issues like #1008 and #1065 consists of a small modification to the existing code, there are other cases where the design decisions are not provided and it would be better for the team to include some justifications and possible discussions of design patterns. The document extensively uses diagrams that depict application flows for each use case which is impressive.
problem The team could have added more test cases as they have mentioned about refactoring the code. The refactored code and the screenshots of the test cases would have been better to display in the wiki for future students.

problem The team could explain the "design"/solution in a more comprehensive way. The team has only pasted the description given in the google doc 
problem The team continued to make changes in round 2 on a regular basis. However, naming should have been more descriptive. In many cases it is not possible to understand the scope of the commit. One team member's work is not reflected in GitHub's contributors panel. I would suggest fixing this by matching user's credentials of local machine and remote server.

problem The team continued making commits on a consistent basis throughout the project development after round 1. Commits are named properly, they describe changes that were done in the scope of that commit. One issue is that all contributors are not reflected in statistics. I would suggest matching git credentials stored on local machine to those stored on the server.

problem The team added the test plan section but it was too short and did not explain all the test files created and/or modified. The implementation section could do without the many code dumps. Otherwise, the writeup was concise and effective.

problem The team added the test cases but the coverage did not increase. Overall coverage decreased (-1.04%) to 46.605%
problem The team added test cases in the spec file for both the issues. Further, a detailed explaination is given using screenshots for manual testing if necessary. The coverage increased for 1 issue while it remained the same for the other.

problem The team added test cases for menu.rb and the coverage increases but the overall coverage seems decrease due to that.
problem The team added more information from the last time which aided in a better explanation of the problem. Good job team
problem The team added many tests. They seem like they would have high coverage, but, with the failing build, this cannot be confirmed easily.
problem The team added a test case. However coveralls shows the following.  Overall coverage decreased (-17.2%) to 19.566% I interpreted this as as decrease in coverage. 
problem The system works well. All the functionality has been implemented. I ran the project and it worked as intended. The back button issue in UI has been fixed.
problem The system works well in most of the cases, except when the realtor creates his company, and then after successfully creating the company, he get's an option to edit his company details, but then when he clicks the edit button, it redirects to the homepage, and is unable to edit his company info unless he choses to belong to the particular company. A minor bug, but still breaks the consistency.
problem The system works well and performs all the operations correctly. -1 for the aforementioned errors in code.
problem The system works exactly how it is supposed to work. I could not find any functionalities that are still failing. No bugs or error messages. It would have been better if the realtor could send replies to inquiries directly from the application than opening a separate mail application.
problem The system works as intended however the flow for system given in the wiki is quite confusing. The test cases were edited to cover all scenarios.
problem The system works as expected and common functionality is working but still needs to focus on some areas: 1. Not able to sign in as admin with preconfigured account. 2. how to add inquiries or to an interest list.

problem The system works as expected and common functionality is working but still needs to focus on some areas: 1. Not able to sign in as admin with preconfigured account. 2. how to add inquiries or to an interest list.
problem The system properly handles the relationships where a real estate company can have multiple realtors. Also, it supports a realtor to create multiple houses and the house hunters to add multiple houses to their interest list.
problem The system performs all the desired functionalities. A shoutout to the idea for the auto filled inquiries. I really liked that feature where the inquiry is already filled after which the user gets an option to edit the inquiry. Some parts need improvement. For ex: The link "new houses" in the house list redirects to the  users/edit link. Its a minor issue which could be looked upon. The layout of the homepage for house-hunter can be fixed as links overlap each other. Also, the houses list shows edit/destroy options for the entire house list, that's a bug which needs fixing.

problem The system operation is verified and works as intended as demonstrated from the video. Also, all the test scenarios are covered.
problem The system operation from UI works as expected by the project. I was able to verify that the rejoinder is given by the team instead of team member. The rejoinder is also made easily available to the user, by providing easy navigation options to give feedback to reviewers, hence making the UI more user friendly. The Author feedback section contains the team's collective feedback to reviewers of particular assignments. Most of the task is to refactor code so that it complies with the new requirement of team rejoinders, and the features work as expected.
problem The System just works in few functions. Even though authors fix the problem that admin cannot log in in the first round, it still lack many functions that the system supposed to have. From the admin perspetive, admin can edit, show and delete any users; create, show, edit and delete any companies, but it cannot create a new user. Besides, when I click the link of house, the 404 page jump out, which means that there is no way that I can see any houses listed. From realtor's perspertive, a realtor can sign up and log in. Apart from these, there is no other fuction that realized in the system. A realtor cannot switch his/her role or edit his/her profile, cannot list houses, choose company she/he belongs to, and reply any inquiries from hunters. From the perspertive of hunter, authors just realized the function of signup and sign in. Besides those, it doesn't have any other functions that the system is supposed to have.

problem The system is in great shape. It is easily one of the best I have seen, and they still didn't implement all of the expected functionality.
problem The system has all the required functionality. However, it would also be useful if the README file explained where some of the features are incorporated. For instance, the submit inquiry field is located on the show page for the houses. This is not immediately intuitive. It could help if that is mentioned in the README
problem The system has all the basic functionalities as per the program description. As per the last feedback, validation checks for invalid data has been added to the application. However, the system still does not have the null checks for field.  For example: If a user creates a house without adding most of the details, the application breaks.  https://housefocus.herokuapp.com/houses
problem The system doesn't check all edge cases. A realtor can see company listings even without choosing a company. The README does not outline exactly how all edge cases are handled
problem The system does not portray good database design. First of all, there are two separate tables for enquiries and reply to enquiries, which is highly not normalised. Also, the fact that there are 3 separate tables for the three types of users is also very in-efficient and non-scalable. It does make an attempt to map the various relationships, but it seems it is not properly tested, and is prone to many bugs.

problem The suggestions have not been improved. Comments aren't explanatory and does not give an idea about what the author intended to do. It would be good to include meaningful comments. Debug code is still in the commit. Even though we may used debug code like the puts statement, we should not commit these as they could create junk data in the application log. Please consider removing them.
problem The submission is about adding tests to the project  and authors have done a great job of adding 92% code coverage.  I would have liked to see more -ve test cases for example cases such as user with incorrect names. As of now the test cases only checks of the user name is present or not. How about the case where user name is such that it is not allowed. User class throws an exception or add method can. This could have been documented. 
problem The structure of codes is not very good, that is, for a "it" statement, there are two many things include in it to be tested. It is better to separate  the test cases clearly. Besides, the objects seem not store in factories properly.
problem The stated design seems to be appropriate. Following a close representation of the current project bidding structure would prove successful. It would have been beneficial to supply more details on how the design would be implemented and could help in the justification of the choices this team used.
problem The source code is mostly written in a coherent way and is straightforward to follow.  The 'context' blocks are extensively used which increases the project documentation. The commented chunks of code blocks that were present in the 1st round are mostly removed. There are still a few instances left and I would suggest to remove them because they reduce the overall readability. I would also suggest to decompose the 'it' block inside the '.final_versions_from_reviewer' by moving the common setup to a before(:each) block and spreading the assertions across several 'it' statements.  Another improvement would be to remove the 'xit' code blocks because they only increase the clutter and do not add any value to the code. Adding one comment explaining why the blocks are no longer necessary would do the job.

problem The source code is mostly following standard Ruby practices, but there is a room for improvement. Firstly, the source contains large chunks of code blocks that are commented out. I would suggest removing those chunks as they reduce the overall readability. Given chunks can always be retrieved via commit history. Secondly, some application level objects like Answer or Criterion are used to create corresponding instances as opposed to mocks. It would be better if the authors either used mocks or provided the reasoning for this decision.

problem The sections included for this design document cover the intent of the group to find and solve the bugs required for their project. I am not sure that the Introduction section reads as an introduction but more as a project problem statement. If this is an introduction more should be included as to what is the purpose of the project and what this current introduction content means. 
problem The section is included by the content is empty. Simply listing steps in how you plan to test for correctness of your model additional would work here.
problem The search properties and addition of potential buyers needed to be improved and fixed after the first round. The authors fixed all of it for round 2. The system works exactly how it is supposed to work. I could not find any functionalities that are still failing. They have added additional features like signing up with google and sending replies to enquiries via email. 
problem The search button in not there. No way to add new house. Realtor is given some destroy privileges which are not meant for him.

problem The screenshots of the expected result and the UML diagram are good, But the screenshots can be smaller to make the page more user-friendly.

problem The screenshots for the view are great, they help in understanding the problem statement and the solution. however the design document lacks use case or class diagrams on how extenral entity interacts with the system and gets response.  Since the authors are using external api's it would have been good if they could give more details request and response

problem The screen mockups were very nice. Good job! I would like to see a UML diagram for the implementation, i.e. how a reference to a static string in a view eventually maps to the correct yaml file. That would make the design more specific and clear.

problem The schema.rb file should be in the repo. From the models and the migrations, the relationships appeared to be correct.
problem The role switch option between realtor and househunter is not present. Further the operation cannot be performed manually also as same mail id cannot be used for creating two accounts.
problem The reuse of the questionaire class is smart to reduce duplication. Otherwise the minimal explanations make it hard to judge
problem The result of edge cases are : 1. The admin cannot delete real companies with realtors and house hunters. 2. The realtor can change real estate company. They ill be prohibited though from viewing previous company listings. 3. The house hunter account along with their inquiries are removed from the system. 4. The realtor account links to a real estate company with 1-to-n mapping.

problem The repository name isn't what it is supposed to be. Naming seems inappropriate. plus, there is no read me file explaining the flow of webapp.
problem The relevant parts in the design doc include the listing of files that will be modified, description of OffscreenCanvasContextRendering2D and apis that need to be implemented for this class. As stated, the team is planning to use the implementation of HTMLCanvasContextRendering2D. I would suggest to elaborate on how OffscreenCanvasContextRendering2D differs from HTMLCanvasContextRendering2D and provide a better feeling for the reader of how significant those differences are.
problem The relationships have been set up properly in the model files as well as the schema. However, a destroy dependency in the model file would be a great addition;  has_many :enquiries, dependent::destroy

problem the relationships between inquiries and house, house and company, potential users and house are absent. 
problem The relationships are maintained in the schema but the relationship among company realtor seems to be missing as it shows relationship between users and company so the role isnt clear
problem The relationship mapping was appropriate and worked as intended. The database unfortunately didn't implement all the necessary features required for the submission. (For example: list of potential buyers)

problem the realtor and house hunter controllers work as desired in most cases though there are some cases which need to be addressed. There is a need to validate the real estate creation form.

problem The README.md file has not been updated hence it does not provide the instructions regarding this system. It does not mention how the system handles the edge cases. Since there is no heroku link given, I cannot test the system for edge cases and also the README.md file does not specify any details.
problem The README.md does not cover how the system handles edge cases. What will happen if the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses?: System deletes the Realestate company but the app crashes when accessing the realtor account. What will happen if a realtor changes his/her real estate company? Will (s)he be prohibited to remove the houses (s)he listed in the previous company? There is no validation at all, and there is no way to have a realtor without a company. If this house hunter is a potential buyer of a house, will (s)he be removed from the corresponding potential buyers list: app crashes

problem The readme seems incomplete. A lot of information could have been communicated through readme.  As an admin, I couldn't delete any of the listed houses or companies which I think should be allowed for the admin.
problem The Readme is very helpful in guiding through the application. Most of the cases have not been handled by the application. > There is no functionality to upload picture to the houses.   > A new house hunter is able to see all the inquires made by all the house hunters which is not as per the application design.  
problem The README is empty and does not contain the admin account information. It's hard to navigate around the interface and determine where all the functionality is.
problem The README is empty and does not contain the admin account information. It's hard to navigate around the interface and determine where all the functionality is.
problem The README file isn't as descriptive as it should be. And UI is not very well designed. Printing "Hello World" on the home page seems to be a debugging strategy but it needs to be removed. And proper links needs to be inserted. Example: Link of 'Logout' is not present
problem The readme file is very helpful and facilitates usage of the application. There are few issues which can still be resolved such as > The navigation issue still persists, for example if a house hunter wants to cancel the inquiry there is no way to do that. The user would be toggling between the inquiry index page and the inquiry submit page. > The validations have still not been addressed for example an inquiry can be created without adding any details at all with all empty fields. > If the house hunter tries to switch to the realtor view the application breaks as below: We're sorry, but something went wrong.   If you are the application owner check the logs for more information.  
problem The readme file is still the default provided by rails. I don't have access to an admin login and when I try to sign up for a new account(realtor or hunter) I get redirected to a webpage telling me that something went wrong. The small ammount of the UI that does exist(login and create account) seems easy enough to understand but it appears that without logging in I cannot see any other links.

problem The README file is properly illustrated but it does not include how the system handles edge cases. The relationship between realtor and company is not properly implemented.
problem the README file is not maintained by the developer. The design is not complete. Whatever is done is intuitive but incomplete.
problem the README file is not maintained by the developer. The design is not complete. Whatever is done is intuitive but incomplete.
problem The README file is developed to include all the necessary details about the project as a whole. Great work on documenting. The UI is simple with properly designed tabs. Few enhancements could include 1. The back button is missing in a few places which might be useful for easier navigation. 2. While creating a company, if size is modelled as a drop down to take a range of values then UI would be simpler.
problem The readme file is blank, so I cannot get access to the admin functions. The user interface is clear but not so well-structured. For example, the title appears after the different choices. And all the choices are list in a single line.

problem The Readme file does not specify any information about how edge cases are handled but the edge cases were properly handled. when the real estate company was deleted all the houses and realtors under it were also deleted. However the role switch option between realtor and househunter is not available, further this operation cannot be performed manually also as the code resticts a mail id from being used for two accounts.

problem The quality of the code is reasonably good. Would it be possible for the team to avoid using the little interpretable ruby they use in the html files and instead use the controllers and its helpers for writing all logic?
problem The quality is of explanation is good and easy to follow. The team might want to add some low-level details for the code changes.

problem The purpose of the project seems quite clear. The team has explicitly mentioned all the requirements that has been expected of them along with the ways to implement said requirements. There is no testing plan however. They should include that and then the document would be good to go.
problem The purpose of the project is very clear and well outlined. The project design seems to be barely mentioned. There have been mentions of the word 'API' but not which one. So reading the doc I have no clue of how they are going to implement this. However I do know the files that they are going to modify. The test plan has been written in the form of cucumber user stories. I am not entirely sure if it is the correct approach.

problem The pull-bots CodeClimate and TravisCI suggest there are a few issues with style and integration that need to be addressed, respectively.
problem The pull request was not updated. (In fact, I can't see any of the changes in the linked repo.)
problem The pull request that the authors have submitted does not pass the Travis Bot builds. But the bot has failed in the tests for which the authors haven't changed any code. So overall the pull request doesn't seem to break any code.
problem The pull request still shows that the build fails. On observing the logs, there is only one build job which fails due to a ActionNotFound error for view_action method. This needs to be looked at.
problem The Pull request shows that the code has failed all the checks. Therefore it should not be deployed.  Suggestions: Rectify the code climate, Travis Build and the merge conflict that is being displayed on the Pull request(Gemfile.lock conflict) . Once done, the code could be deployed. Functionality is working fine, no doubt but build must not be deployed unless the above issues are resoled. 
problem The pull request says the Travis CI build is in progress, but that seems improbable. Upon closer investigation into the Travis CI "details", it looks like the build is failing.

problem The proposed solution sounds good. They haven't really mentioned the changes in turn of programmer language. I couldn't visualize how are they going to make changes. They have mentioned few html.erb file but I think they would need put a good amount of work to implement the new feature. I think the team could have been more precise in their approach, for example, they could have included what all new methods they need to add or modify the existing one.

problem the proposed refactoring changes seem to follow good ruby principles and also looks DRY.  They haven' t mentioned any pattern as such. But overall the design document looks neat and very well written.
problem The proposed design seems reasonable. Before proceeding with the project, team should also look at other references to those functions and do it accordingly.
problem The proposed design looks fine for now, but more details are required in order to make a better judgement. So I think that more effort should be expended.
problem The proposed changes sounds good to me. But as I mentioned screenshots help in a better understanding of the problem statement. Moreover a more detailed doc would have been better.
problem The proposed changes section of the wikipedia clearly mentions the column names the team would implement sort on. But, how they want to implement the sort could be explained a little more in detail. They mention they would use tablesorter JQuery, but I would suggest to add some sort of a pseudocode that would explain better how exactly does the sorting work.

problem The project writeup explains very well the topics that it has covered. However, it has not covered many of the topics like implementation, and even a test plan.
problem The project works as mentioned in the file.  
problem The project was not deployed. The project should have been deployed. However, the video that the team uploaded shows the 2 functionalities that they have implemented. And they work as intended. Suggestion: One feature was not implemented (3rd issue) and should have been done as a part of the deliverable. And the project should have been deployed.
problem The project seems to be incomplete. The work done is also not properly mentioned in the writeup.
problem The project purpose seems to be only a user story, that says what's the deficiencies of te corrent issues and a terse solution. I wonder if that's comprehensive enough. I would add some more details in terms of the purpose of each function being changed in a lower level.  There' only a high-level solution , and which files to change  for the project design. They are not detailed enough. I would add some more plans in terms of how to make the change, when to do the change if the changes are inter-dependent. There's no testing plans yet. But I think that should be stated.

problem The project purpose is well defined and clearly explains what this project aims to do. The team also identifies the strategies they wish to adopt to fix the issue. This explanation is clear and concise. However, I would also suggest the team to add a basic test plan, on how they would test the functionality they add. Also I suggest them to list down the list of files they would be changing.

problem The project purpose is stated, but not extremely clearly. It seems that in the "Introduction" part, there's just copy-pasted messages from the question statement. The flowchart in the introduction part is good, but where should this checkbox be implemented? It seems that here it should only be implemented in the instructor/administrator end, instead of students end. But that's not clearly stated in the project purpose part. The project design is also not very detailed. The title " Do Some Changes" doesn't seems to be very serious, but apart from that, the implementation details are also copy pasted from the online project requirements. the two picture of before and after illustration looks nice enough. It's good that the team has found some extra sources that would allow them to get this before and after picture.  The testing plan is not stated at all...
problem The project purpose is stated in detail, in the Introduction part. Starting from the background and problem statement ( to improve the quality of report views"). The purpose is stated in five different small goals separately: make changes in view submissions, view scores, view review report, author feedback report and teammate review report five different parts. In terms of project purpose, it's comprehensive and detailed. As for project design, it is carefully outlined in the "Solution" and "Modification of files" part. I think the project design might needs a bit more description, in terms of what steps needs to do first, and what steps needs to be done next. It seems that all the changes are for the UI, but is there any UI that can be served as a pattern, for the usage of others? Or is there any implementation of one UI dependent on the implementation of another? Here, I think there needs to be more detailed steps. The testing plan includes detailed steps in terms of how to test the implementation as a  end user. I like it very much because it is both succinct and very intuitive. It will be good to add some sample pictures when the project is over and some pictures that display the functionality becomes available.

problem The project only has 3 commits, all on  a single day. So yes, it can't be said that the project was implemented or developed over a period of time. 
problem The project needs validations on all fields (I was able to enter random values in email address, mobile number fields). Some of the additional functionalities were missing (filter inquiry, see who has added my house to their inquiry list etc). The project is well connected and navigation is easy. Overall it looks very clean and intuitive!

problem The project is to refactor the existing functionality and code. The functionality seems to be working fine.
problem The project is ready to be merged. The source code is clearly structured and can be used for the future team to work on. The project has 100% code coverage.  In order to avoid potential problems of using AssignmentParticipant instance, participantSuper object is defined in factories.rb, which is an instance of Participant class. The possible suggestions are to deconstruct #scores method and introduce 'context' constructs to enhance code documentation.

problem The project is not deployed on either of mentioned cloud platforms such as Heroku, AWS or VCL. Instead an locally run server's IP link is provided, which doesn't seem to work. As a result, I cannot test the interface at all. No README is provided as well.
problem The project is complete and sound enough in its approach and the implementations and the test plan has been well devised and just shy of application. Even so, in their project they lack two sections of key note, i.e. one is the project design and the solution approach.

problem The project is almost on the stage that it can be deployed on the production server. However, there are few test cases that are failing as shown on the git. If these minor flaws are fixed then the code is good to go.
problem The project is about adding tests to the a model. So this is okay but there is not sufficient background on the model itself. More details would be good for the uninitiated.  Also they mention that the number of tests for the model were not sufficient. It would have been better if they would have quoted the code coverage numbers before and after.     
problem The project includes the problem statement. The team has described the problem statement in detail and has also provided visual aids. However, the team could have also included the way in which they implement these changes. 
problem The project has successfully named it's varables and function names according to the principle. They are understandable form what the mean. But the project lacks any documentation internally, as well as a proper external readme file. Lack of code documentation makes it tough for the reviewer to make sense of the code. Apart from that, the design of the database schema isn't normalized to much extent, which makes data entries redundant.
problem The project goals are stated in a simple and precise manner. The design document is readable and easy to understand from. They have provided the reader with the background which states the need to do the refactoring. They can include or add file names which they are about to change.

problem The project covers a significant part of the functionality for testing the participant. However, the biggest problem is that the #scores method is commented out from the class AssignmentParticipant. Obviously this will break the existing code that relies on that functionality. Furthermore, the future testing will possibly become complicated because the object under test for participant_spec.rb is an instance of AssignmentParticipant as opposed to Participant.

problem The project consists of making a search function to select specific users, assignments etc using some criteria. So they're creating a search functionality for individual models.
problem The project consists of five independent problems the scope of which is well-defined in the design document. The team provides visual diagrams in the solution descriptions which further improve the explanations of changes. The fix for the Issue #1008 - "Issue related to staggered deadline" is backed up by a discussion about relevant db tables and corresponding part of code. One minor improvement would be for the authors to highlight the specific parts of code that are going to be changed in the updated block of code. Moreover, the solution to the Issue #1072 - "Issue related to instructor's assignment participation" is not specific enough, i.e. it is not clear which structures are going to be affected by the changes. All in all, the document does a great job in explaining what changes are going to be introduced in the system.
problem The problems are described very nicely. When it comes to changes to be made, files to be modified are given. I feel more explanation needs to be given with respect to changes in these files for each problem stating why this file needs to be changed and what the impact will be.

problem The problem being addressed by this project is defined cogently without any ambiguities. Test cases are considered separately starting with description of the given method followed by how the functionality is being tested.

I would suggest removing parts like Expertiza description (http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/index.php/User_talk:Rshakya#Expertiza) and rationale behind using Rspec (http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/index.php/User_talk:Rshakya#Unit_Testing_with_RSpec) because those parts fall out of the scope of this topic.

problem The page feel more like a project report instead of wiki page. They should not tell people to "go through the following page", instead they should just tell, "the page" is previous work.
problem The overall UI is good, but there can be some improvements made on the admin part of the app. We need to change the link manually to end up at the admin dashboard.

problem The overall test has coverage decreased. However, the RSpec tests added to the project seem appropriate. 
problem The overall test coverage decreased by 0.6%. You could have added test cases to  response controller.rb and application helper.rb. These files have contributed the most to the decrement in test coverage.                      
problem The Overall System works as it is supposed to.However,there are few functions which are not implemented. Realtors' Page: Validations for phone number have not been written because a phone number of length less than 10 is getting accepted by the system during sign up of a realtor. Houses does not start from 1 under the "Your Houses" section in the realtors page. Your Houses 2 3  Delete house option is not provided under the realtors page.The functionality to change from realtor to house hunter and vice versa is not provided.Functionality to edit or delete a company under the realtors page is not implemented. House Hunters' page: House hunter should not be able to update and create new houses but these links are provided under the house hunter page. Although the functionality of update and create new house has not been implemented. It gives out the following error messages.  Error messages- ActionController::UrlGenerationError in Houses#show Showing /home/ubuntu/OODD/ooddHMS/app/views/houses/show.html.erb where line #60 raised: No route matches {:action=>"show", :controller=>"realtorprofile", :id=>nil}, missing required keys: [:id] NoMethodError in HousesController#new   undefined method `houses' for nil:NilClass

problem The overall purpose of the project, the need for mocks/stubs, and the scenarios of each test case are very well presented; however, there is little explanation about why certain tests were implemented in any particular fashion. It would be a nice addition to include a few of your test cases and explain your reasoning behind why/how you implemented that test case. Adding this would further clarify your design/testing plan choices and make for a fantastic read.

problem The overall look of the page is well explained. However, I could not understand the back-end design plan, as in how/where the team will be adding such features in the code.
problem The overall design looks good. The score calculation formula still looks a bit weird. Using the current formula, it is possible to have a higher  composite score than each of the individual scores , which should not be the case.

problem The only thing I had trouble with was changing from a house hunter to a realtor and back. It's possible I just missed the option. In my opinion, that is a rather insignificant omission.

problem The only changes stated in the document was copied from the description. It is not enough to explain what exact changes the team will provide and how they will be done. 
problem The number of commits that are made after the 1st round is impressive. The team has made a significant progress during the 2nd round, however I would suggest using more descriptive names for the commits so that it becomes easier for the reader to refer to them in the future.

problem The newly added code includes the attribute height, the getContext() and transferToImageBitmap() method in the OffscreenCanvas.webidl file. The name height given for the attribute height for the Canvas makes complete sense. Similarly the name getContext() given for the method that returns the OffscreenRenderingContext is also intuitive. The name transferToImageBitmap is a little long which might be the code less readable if the method is called often. Instead the accessor convention of using getImageBitmap() feels more intuitive and also logical at the same time.
problem The newly added code has not yet been accepted in the pull request but it does build. The corresponding rust implementation, however, has not been added and so the test coverage hasn't improved by much.
problem The newly added code does not resolve the previous issues to great extent.
problem The new design seems to violate the DRY principle. Copying an entire class and then editing it will likely cause problems as you will be using code you did not write and so will not understand as well as your own code. This is probably still a better design decision than writing the offscreen canvas from scratch, however, since it will take less time. Could you use delegation or extension to DRY out the implementation?
problem The new design loops through all existing reviews to compare new review scores with the original ones, and stores the URL of a specific iteration if its limit is exceeded. By waiting for all reviews to be looped in before sending email, it may increase the response time of the system.

problem The new design does not talk about any methods or class definitions, thus I cannot comment on this. Suggestion: You can add more information on methods or any usage of design patterns in order to make the review effective and useful.

problem The necessary functionalities are implemented. The README file explains how to access some of these functionalities also. However, the company listings appear even before the realtor chooses a company. This shouldn't happen
problem The naming looks fine in html file. Although your pull request shows changes in schema.rb file which i don't think you have used any where or had to make changes int it. Probably is went through by default when you pushed your changes. You might want to revert that from the pull request. That way I think your build will also pass.
problem The naming conventions have been followed. The professor had frequently asked the team to improve the naming conventions and it seems that the conventions have been properly folowed.
problem The names are very intuitive and one can easily understand the reason for each of the variables from their names. In addition the test coverage has increased however it is not very good.
problem The names are all proper. However, there are lines of code which are commented out. Cleaning up that would reduce the clutter.
problem The MVC structure is good, but some details should  be improved.
problem The motivation is not enough. It is a little bit simple and general. The team should add the introduction to the specific motivation for this project.
problem The most recent Travis build was run 2 days ago and the build log says that it has failed.

problem The modifications that are suggested by the team are minimalistic and cover the changes that are necessary for the javascript library to work. While it is possible to infer the majority of changes that will be introduced in this project, it would be better if the authors elaborated on the implementation of all the views as opposed to discussing only the "view submissions" table.

problem The models, views and controllers have been properly designed and implemented.
problem The models had the correct relationships. The database seemed to have missed some of these. There was not table for potential buyers (n-to-n house-hunter relationship).

problem The models , views and controllers are well created. 1)      You can seed data for the admin into your production environment. The command to do this on heroku is heroku run rails db:seed. You need to make changes in the db/seeds.rb file and add your admin credentials in the proper format in this file.

problem The mock UIs are well thought of and make navigation easier. A couple of suggestions: - can add another mock UI showing the drop down. - Some types of reports may not exist. If the drop down options are hard-coded, selecting an option might lead to a page with no content (this might be an existing issue I suspect). For every option, you could query for existence of at least one record before putting that option in the drop down.

problem The methods seem like the ones created by the scaffold command. Even for the views, there isn't any code for eg. to display house delete only to the realtor who has created it.
problem The method names and variable names are very well defined ! The best I have seen so far ! No clear explanation is given as to which files are edited for which reason. Only file names are stated along with changes made. Why the changes were made and what do those changes correct is not given.

problem The Menu test case violates the DRY principle. The team can make use of factories to get rid of code redundancy. Overall good work!
problem The manual tests listed should adequately test the functionality, but information should be provided on automated testing.
problem The main thread behind the design seems to be reusing the existing code which provides the similar functionality. This is a great idea. It is consistent with the appropriate programming principles e.g. not reinventing the wheel. One suggestion would be for the authors to explain why the instance of the class, from which the relevant parts of code are going to be copied, is not directly used as this would be a more DRY approach. In a case if this is not possible, then providing a proper reasoning and justification would be helpful.
problem The login page is not made. All the admins information is listed on the first page which should not be allowed. It was difficult to understand if I was under the admin's page, realtor's or hunter's page.
problem The login opens the user page which has which has 5 "back" links for some reason and they do not do anything. No common home page for all the list views. Have to all the list views go from user pages. List of companies is not in tabulated form, thus very difficult to read
problem The login and sign up page work as expected. But the following have changes to be implemented - The view is poorly developed. Admin login credentials are not mentioned, so could not test the admin functionality. Validation for phone number and email id has not been done. The system accepts a number which has less than 10 digits and an invalid email id. Creation of a new house is inside inquiries tab under realtors page which is misleading. Not able to associate a realtor with a company, hence not able to validate the update and delete functionality of a company from inside the realtors page.  Not able to switch between realtor and house hunter if an user is both. Delete and update functionalities have not been implemented. Inquiry creation from house hunter page is not implemented. 
problem The login / signup module seems to be well tested of all the other models and controllers in the program. But this module has a drawback. It deals with three tables, the realtors, the househunters and the admin. Due to this kind of segmentation, there is a repetition of data i the database, if any user would like to signup as both. Also, it would make it difficult to handle complexity as the application grows. According to me, its better to atleast cascade the tables of realtors and house hunters into one.  The other functionalities are not wholly implemented, only the CRUD operations related to those are implemented, hence not much could be reviewed about testing.

problem The login / signup module has lots of bugs. Like when a user tries to create an account with an already existing username, the application crashes. Also, a user cannot signup as both, a realtor and a househunter. Moreover, there isnt any validtion for the length of phone number, nor the validation for the email address is correct. (for example, it accepts aa@a as a valid email address). So yes, these functionalities in the login signup module could be improved, and these does not seem thoroughly tested. But the search functionality for the houses seemed to work pretty well, and as expected.
problem The logic showed in the design is clear and easy enough, but the deign lacks essential details for dealing with reviews.
problem The logic in the code looks proper, still the code itself is hard to follow. Primarily because, a lot of functionality has been added in a method whose name suggests only partial functionality, and no comments have added anywhere. Examples are-: In applicatins_controller.rb, the methods get_realtor_nav_bar and get_hoousehunter_nav_bar make SQL queries and other functionalities. In houses_controller.rb the show method also has a lot code that ideally should not belong in that method. I would suggest to put such code in different methods, or name the method better. Do not shy away from creating 10 different methods if need be, it organises code much better and simpler to understand.

problem The introduction to the scope of the project has been written neatly, but I feel the test plan should have been a little more elaborative, a short description of the tests would be nice to have.
problem The introduction paragraph contains bullets that are identical to E1791 which is surprising.  The flowchart does not cover "No" or negative cases and is thus incomplete. What is logged in the DB and how exactly is "start" and "end" time is very ambiguous.  Apart from a mention of "merging the data of the details page on the current report page." in the introduction, I cannot see any further discussion of this particular objective. For auto-save, you could think of using the on-unload event of JavaScript (like onload event). Also, setTimeout doesn't seem to be an efficient idea, since that would make too many number of calls from the page (I guess you would be sending an Ajax request, which is asynchronous). A next call might be made before a previous call response is handled. When you say "For each time the reviewer starts a review, it will check whether a previous record for this review already exists in the database. If it does exist then it will update the end time of this record" - what if I open a review that I had done two days back? As soon as I open the page, will it mark end_time as now() .? In that case, does that mean I have done this review for 2 days..?

problem The interface is well designed and has a good UI but the basic functionalities are breaking. Unable to login as Hunter/Admin and can perform their respective operations. I assume the default user is the realtor.(as after login I can only post/add new house).

problem The interface is basic and no extra styling is done. But overall the web application is easy and intuitive to use. The Read me  file of the github repo should be updated to make it more   detailed to use.  
problem The intended changes are not stated clearly. Some solutions are also ambiguous, the team only said that they would change some files or look more codes, but they didn't say how they will change.

problem the inquiry form is not working
problem The inquiry controller was thoroughly tested, but none of the models appear to have the same amount of testing.
problem The inquiries aren't linked to house hunters.
problem The information provided is good but the page is not organised and the code is confusing. Team should work on improving the format of content(the way they are representing info).

problem The implementation does not seem to be working, so it would be difficult to test this. Also, I am no Rust programmer, so there's that.
problem The implementation details have been mentioned in the writeup clearly. Information about what every function does has been explained in an eloquent manner. 
problem The implementation can only log one type of user on and even though not specified, the user has all controls so it can be assumed its an admin. Admins can signup as well.

problem The househunter can edit the company, which is odd.    
problem The house hunter page is not working. I logged in as a realtor and then switched to house hunter view. I was not able to see any house list, any interest list, send inquiry form etc. Deducted points for that. no filter function.
problem The house hunter model seemed to work according to most of the tasks mentioned. Not for the admin and realtor ones. Was unable to login as admin. Was unable t signup as realtor.

problem The high-level design which is needed to start with the work looks prominent. As the project proceeds, few intricacies resulting due to design conflicts, scalability need to be addressed as and when required. But the team has laid out a solid foundation to begin with.
problem The high level view of the solution appears to be reasonable. The problem with this design is that there is no discussion present about any principles or patterns that are going to be utilized as part of the solution. I would suggest using certain keywords to make the decisions more clear to the reader. For example the authors talk about reusing the code of HTMLCanvasContextRendering2D and WebGLRenderingContext. It would be helpful if the concrete mechanism were specified. For example patterns like Decorator or Adapter would be relevant for this case.
problem The heroku link to this project has not been submitted. So I am not able to check if the system works as it is supposed to work. But through the github link, the code seems legible. Without the heroku link I am not able to check if there is any functionality is missing or not.
problem The have included a detailed design flow representation and have also included the visualizations. The could have added Lo-Fi UI cards to depict changes to views which will help them visualize the changes and also help instructors in suggesting improvements at an early stage which will help reduce unnecessary code changes in latter stages of the project.

problem The handle_duplicates function has a lot of white space and print statements left in it. It could've been chopped up into tiny sub-functions too, hypothetically.
problem The hand drawn diagrams are good enough to explain the problem to others , next time they can update it with the actual page once its done.
problem The group has not shared the link for the test environment. Hence unable to test the edge cases. However, in the screen cast they have covered the functionalities mentioned in the requirement document.

problem The given source code is ready for deployment. The object under test is fully covered and all of the test cases are implemented correctly. The build successfully passes Travis CI. The future team will have no problems in picking up from here. However, there is a room for further improvement when it comes to simplifying several test cases, especially the '.final_versions_from_reviewer' block. Moreover, 'xit' blocks need to be removed because the final version should not contain any tests that are in the pending state.

problem The git repository link is not provided. A zip file is provided instead.
problem The git may very well contain the appropriate testing files; however, I am unable to view the due to the privacy settings of the repository. I would suggest that your try and test those models/controllers that have the most complexity to increase the level of confidence in your product. Make sure to test the validations and boundary cases thoroughly, especially model attributes that have restrictions on things such as length and type.  There are also several instances in the project where various users can accomplish the same tasks but with slight differences. It will be to your benefit to pay close attention in creating tests that can replicate these tasks. 
problem The git link to the code repository is not provided.
problem The Git link provided redirected me to a page saying "404 Not found." Since there isn't any links of the deployed project, i could not test it.
problem The git link is not correct. Also, the project is not deployed.
problem The functions are not too long so the code doesn't have to be extracted into separate methods. More comments could have been added for easy understanding of the code. The code follows the Ruby style guide and the code looks refactored, statements "unless" keyword are written in a single line.

problem The Functionality is working just fine. I noticed one small problem though. As a house hunter, when I added a house to my interest list and then click on more, it says that the page that I was looking for does not exist.
problem The functionality has been written well. Though I do feel it would have been better if the test cases implemented had been explained in more detail as to what the do.
problem The functionality added to the pull request is reaonable and makes use of appropriate keywords. It could be improved by giving names according to convention like feed_ back_ review_response_map could just be feed_back as jt is part of the review response map model file.

problem The functionalities relating to Questionnaire have been moved to Questionnaire from QuizQuestionnaire which is very helpful. Suggestion: 1. You can try to create sub functions for code inside create and view, as they are really long functions
problem The functionalities of interest list and inquiries are implemented in a crude way, i.e. by creating a drop down for a listings. It becomes very tedious for the user to go and choose a house from hundreds of listings every time to just add it to a interest list. A better way would have been by creating an option of adding to the interest list where user can see all the listings. Adding a user to interest list does not add the buyer a to a house's potential buyer's list. There is no option for viewing potential buyers.
problem The functionalities have been implemented , but the back button is a major problem
problem The functionalities are working fine. The describes in the tests could be a little more verbose.

problem The flow diagram used is basically a pictorial representation of the problem statement and so it does not really add any more value. It would be really helpful if the authors could include a real flow diagram that shows the actual flow of events. The screenshots provided help us to understand what changes the authors are expecting in the UI.
problem The flow charts are good and help a lot in understanding the work. Again. it would be better to explain the abbreviations.

problem The files to be changed have been properly listed. I feel more explanation ought be given as to why these files have been modified and in what way.
problem The features work properly but still need more tests to test the functions.
problem The features work correctly, as expected. The instructor login only has one "Student View" tab under the Manage menu. On clicking it the instructor is successfully redirected to the student view page which has the "Close Student View" button to redirect to the default view.

Could have made a demo video showing the improvements or a step guide to follow. They could have also provided some steps or a visual navigation guide to see the changes. For edge cases you could check what happens when assignments have same names, blank or whitespace containing names etc.

problem The feature to add a company to a realtor does not work correctly in the application. The app crashes when he chooses the company. The team could try to fix this issue and correspondingly handle the edge cases.
problem The feature seems ok but it can't be deployed yet with all pending issues.
problem The feature implementation section is good to go. However the test cases can be improved on a lot. That doesn't mean that the test cases shouldn't be deployed.

problem The Facebook signup which wasn't working in the previous sign up works properly. The admin, realtor, customer functionalities are working fine and I can see a lot of improvement from the previous version. The realtor can send a receive queries by the customer. However, a small suggestion would be to ask a realtor for the company name while filling the sign up form. Apart from that, the system fulfills all the requirements of the project
problem The explanations were inadequate and could have been given more elaborately written. The document just contains the details given in the user story document by professor. More content can be added and the flow of logic can be added.

problem The explanations are succinct. However, in the Controllers section, it is unclear which controller in expertiza project the authors are referring to. The authors could mention the name of the controller(s) they intend to change and also possible method(s) that might be added to it. 
problem The explanations are provided as points which is very easy to follow and understand. Though, the need for the proposed UI change is not very clear to me. Few more details on actually how the strategy pattern is going to be incorporated in current code would have been insightful. The explanation on the test controller is ambiguous.

problem The explanations are good. Separating cases to cases and discuss them one by one is a good strategy.  However, none of them is explained in detail. They are all a little bit terse. After reading it, I still have the following questions: 1. how to change the list_submissions.html.erb? What are the functions that is already implemented? The four cases in the explanation did not say clearly whether they are already implemented or not. 2. "The feature as understood from the past project is that Assign Grade is present for all teams. (Standardize the functionality)" I did not quite understand this sentence. What's its relation too the four cases proposed here? 3. the problem of " response controllder checks 2 times and should be reduced to 1", there's not a lot of detailed plan in this implementation.

problem The explanation is good, and they have managed to get in a prototype UI as well. My only concern with the design is, if there are a lot of assignments the page might become very wide and will require a horizontal scroll bar to access all the data for the user.
problem The explanation is descriptive and explains the logic behind the solution which is think should work. However, I believe that team should can add the explanation about the files and classes they tend to make changes in. The team can now focus on implementation of the code.

problem The explanation given by the authors was pretty straightforward. Looking at the explanations it looks like the authors have thought about different aspects of the problem statement and also of different ways to implement the GitHub metrics integration feature along with the side effects of implementing it in a particular way. e.g one would think that adding the metrics to the database would be a sound solution but given the nature of an open source project and the fact that students would commit beyond the deadline the authors have thought not to add the metrics to the database which is sound and reasonable.

It also includes the proposed design that specifies the flow of the project and the files that are interlinked. The testing plan has not been included in the current version of documentation. I expect that the team is working on it and will include it for the 2nd round after they start the implementation.

I think that you can remove the expertiza introduction section as mentioned by the professor.

problem The document shows the flow of work really well.However, I would like to suggest to put more of test planning and the tools and technologies that will be used. This will enhance the quality of the document to a great extent.
problem The document shows how they will be using the API. However, since it is initial they have not clearly mentioned the functionality required.

problem The document should expand on the design and make specific assertions about how the changes will be propagated. So far the idea behind the design is to utilize an existing code of HTMLCanvasContextRendering2D adding new functionality like blob API on top of that. One suggestion would be to elaborate on that and discuss how the new functionality will be merged with existing code, what patterns might be used to increase the efficacy and simplicity of the system.
problem The document seems to be generally well-designed. However, I believe that they have glossed over how a link is said to be "closed". They properly described the additional functionality and the challenges they will likely face.

problem The document provided by the team is very detailed and includes all the requirements which are suggested by the Change Request. However, the team may change tone of the document as it is instructive  right now which seems like the change request description itself. The team might also add a wiki link for this document so that it could be included in the expertiza links of existing and ongoing changes and would be more reachable to a wider audience.

problem The document needs more details on the implementation of the OffscreenCanvasContextRendering2D, the support for WebGL contexts, and the Blob API. Also, what is a DOM and a Blob? Those terms should be defined in the design document in case any readers are unfamiliar with them.      
problem The document mostly copies from the description provided by instructor and lacks the essential parts like design and test plan. Although some instructions provided, it is not clear enough and cannot help readers to figure out what the project is about and what's the purpose.
problem The document mentions the tools of JQuery sorting table, in fact which API or any sample code that can be referenced to is expected in the document. Also, this project seems to focus on the view part of Expertiza, so the test plan should be more detailed, cover more edge case.

However, there could be more details to explain how to implement the solutions, for example, you can tell more about the changes will be made for the specific solution instead just listing the files need to be changed. Also, the testing plan should be added.

problem The document is well-written. They have described the plan of action along with the different routes they would need to explore in order to complete the task at hand. They also gems that can be used and API to query if gems were not allowed. They have a section called the testing plan, however that doesn't look like a traditional testing plan. It just shows the navigation path that different users would take.

problem The document directly dives into issue, they could have provided more information on different scenarios that are currently facing the said issue and its magnitude. This could have been helpful to counteract the problem in the future in other scenarios
problem The document covers a number of important topics including the description of Servo, apis and concepts that are going to be used by the team in this project, problem statement, project build and proposed design. However, the testing plan is not discussed. While the instances of testing is certainly mentioned in the document, e.g. "specific functionalities could be tested by writing a custom html file and then running it the similar way." and "Finally, well test our code by enabling the blob API." the authors do not provide an extensive discussion of specifically what functionality is going to be tested. I would suggest reducing the overall size of the initial sections which provide an overview of Servo project, Off Screen Canvas, Web workers and Web IDL. They introduce more verbosity to the document than necessary. Two or three descriptive sentences could be used instead. The reader could refer to a more detailed information through references. Furthermore, the focus of the problem statement falls on the description of the OffscreenCanvas API making it somewhat redundant. It would be better to emphasize on flashing out the goal of the project and only later provide the reference to the technical details if necessary. Another suggestion would be for the team to identify and elaborate on the 'changes' that are going to be merged in servo.
problem The document contains a UML Use Case Diagram that analyze the system's requirements and describes the actors involved and the relationship between them. It helps to understand the overview of the project details. However, it can certainly make use of a flow diagram in the Expected Flow section that gives more clarity about the sequence of actions. The flow diagram can follow from the use case diagram to show the tasks performed by the actors in a serial order.  
problem The document clearly states what is missing and how they are planning to implement that thing , they state how many new criterion are they going to add to the search feature, However, I would suggest them to include how will they implement it. There is no explanation of how things will be done.

problem The document clearly mentions the requirement of the project with the problem statement.
problem The document clearly explains what was the problem and what was the solution they proposed.They have also compared and contrasted with the previous solution which is good. They have talked about how different roles come into play with respect to security perspective and what the pros and cons of having/not having those roles. Comparing the code changes gave a clearer view of the code changes. One improvement could be in the 'background' part.  Taking it as it was: The majority of the project was related to solving issues regarding the deletion of Administrator and Instructor accounts. Administrator and Instructor are both account types that inherit behavior from User but are (1)handled and deleted in different codepaths. Furthermore, properties are used on a User that aren't on an Administrator, (2)such as team ids or course associations  (1) The different codepaths could have been shown to get a better view (atleast a screenshot, considering it wasnt within the problem scope) (2) Although, why these properties arent on Administrator is defined in the forthcoming sessions, it was little unclear while reading it. (It could have been quoted that 'as we will see it in the forthcoming sections')
problem The doc seems complete. All aspects of the problem statement are covered and test plan is also included. A use-case diagram will be useful to add.
problem The doc says participant.rb model is  changed. However that file is not currently committed. However assignment_participant model file is committed. Seems to be some mismatch at one of the places. Correcting it will help in understanding what work is done and how does it impact the functionality.

problem The diagrams seems to be good for most of the part. One can understand the project by looking at the diagrams itself. However, in one of the instructor flow diagram, it's given that if the instructor's status is pending the instructor will set the limit to 10. That doesn't make sense. Why would the instructor himself/herself set the limit to 10. Isn't this the responsibility of the system itself to handle this or at the most the admin? Suggestions: Change the 'yes' branch of is pending? to loop 10 times or somehow indicate that pending instructors can add only 10 students to an assignment.

Especially the second testcase where it is stated that the dates will be changed accordingly. What dates will be changed and how should be mentioned. A similar flow-chart  will make it very clear as to what you plan to test.

problem The developers have put in dropdowns for role selection and company selection making the interface more intuitive. The application broke in Heroku when I tried to login though it might be a Heroku specific error. The login/signup buttons on the landing page don't seem to work. In fact, none of the buttons seem to work, and I am not even getting the hand pointer as you have mentioned in the readme.
problem The details regarding testing are mentioned in the writeup. But I did not find anything about the Test plan as such, in the writeup. The assignment_participant_spec contains a test. One edge case has been considered. I feel that the Test Plan should have been mentioned in the writeup explicitly.
problem The details are not enough, so it is difficult to tell if the design follows approbate principles. The diagrams covers most of changes they need to make.

problem The designs that the authors have proposed are consistent with the code and do not introduce any obvious problems. However, the design decisions for issues #1017 and #1072 are missing and therefore cannot be assessed. I would suggest including the discussion of the specific parts of the source code that are going to be addressed in this project. Posting the exact solution is not necessary.
problem The design sounds good, but that's largely due to how vague it is: naturally we want to add the things we need to add, and remove the things we need to remove.
problem The design seems workable. Maybe they can come up a more sound design. For example, they can try many ways to define the notification limit.
problem The design seems to follow appropriate principles and pattern. It is simple and clearly explains what needs to be done and where the changes will be made. Suggestion: addition of screen mock-ups to document will help reviewers a lot.

problem The design seems to be sound. I would like more details on the database of the Bacui projects seeing as most of us don't know what they look like given that most of us have worked on Expertiza projects. So, a short description of the different tables the project is going to interact with along with any and all modifications would really help understand IF there will be any possibility that the design would turn out to be non-DRY or smelly.I think the team is good on what gems are to be used.
problem The design seems to be good. It is still not very clear of the path for implementation or the files that they plan to add and the methods in said files however that is fine considering that this is just the initial stage and not much can be said since we haven't advanced to the implementation stage yet.  The authors seem to doubt whether they are allowed to use any existing gem. I think they should go ahead and use the gems.

This functionality should consider the mapping to the review_mapping controller file that will implement the given features.
problem The design proposed by the team looks complex in terms of the functionalities desired. They must backup these changes by providing a pictorial representation of the task like the one described in the documentation. This can help to understand the project in a better way.

problem The design plan portion feels a bit lacking. I found myself wanting more detail about how and what they were going to copy between each implementation and the next. What's going to be filtered out? What's going to be added? I have no clue...
problem The design looks solid, but it's hard to tell without sufficient detail. If anything, causing every static string reference to be encapsulated into an object that uses the current language to return the correct string is more DRY and maintainable than what we have now. I wonder if dynamic translation gems are out there or would work. The claim that dynamic translation should not be done in this project should be defended, e.g. it would take too much time.

problem The design looks good enough. It mostly deals with html.erb files to accommodate the graph and some database filtering in the controllers.I do not think that the design will increase the responses time of the system. Suggestion: If the details regarding how the graph will be implemented or any gem will be used should have been given. I did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality. That too would have been useful. 
problem The design looks a bit complicated and will increase the response time of the system. It can make the code smelly. Too complicated code handled in issue 1 which could be refactored.
problem The design lacks dynamic paging for different users. all the links are visible to all the users and upon clicking the links an error comes that you are not authorized to perform the action. Ideally only relevant links should be visible to the user. It confuses the user regaring the actions he/she can perform. The user needs to perform all the actions visible in the UI to know what are the actions relevant for him/her. The readme file also is not well described about the actions that can be performed by the user. The readme file currently lacks any relevant information.
problem The design lacks diagrams to state what the changes they will do and how it will be like after change. It is difficult to image how the system will be like after change and what will be changed.

problem The design isn't great (as mentioned in the documentation) due to code duplication, but I agree that it may be the easiest way to start - hopefully a better solution can be found in the future to improve DRYness.
problem The design isn't extremely simple to understand at first glance. But given that the feature to be implemented is slightly complicated, the team has made efforts to make it as clear as possible.

problem The design is sound because it has plans of file modification, of implemented solution, and very detailed testing plan. The DRY principle might not be well followed, since in each testing, the tester needs to log in as a super_administrator2 again. And there are five testings.

problem The design is sound because it has a well-developed plan for writing the funcationality, and it also has a detailed code level design. It does follow the DRY principle, because it adds on directly from the given files, thus does not repeat itself. It doesn't use observable patterns here. But that's because there's not a lot of implementations to be made. And it does follow the pattern of the original file.
problem The design is sound because it follows the problem statement and the instructions. I doubt if it follows the DRY principle while looping through each review, because that might be already done in the Expertiza. In terms of patterns, I think here it needs to use the factory pattern, altough it's not stated in the design.

problem The design is simple- the authors have discussed the changes like allowing instructor to change language of a course and adding multi-language support in the design. One suggestion is that the authors could have described the difference between static and dynamic strings used in this context. Especially since they specify that only static strings will be translated, but dynamic strings will remain in English.

problem The design is ambiguous. The team only said they will make "some" changes to the current system but didn't state clearly what kind of changes they will make and how these changes will be done. For example, for the first step, we need more information about how the team will change the UI, the model and the controller or helper to realize what the team said.

problem The design includes adding a checkbox field to the view, and based on whether the box is checked or not, students are allowed to or not to do reviews in the second round. This is the main functionality of the project. However, the authors do not mention how they are planning to implement this.
problem The design includes a test plan. However the test plan has nothing related to tests or which test cases are going to be considered. It just explains the flow of how an instructor would reach the GitHub metrics data page.The team should at least mention which files are the test cases going to be written on and what functionalities are they going to test.

problem The design includes a brief test plan that lists three scenarios namely- the regular steps to update Course page to Hindi; checking if Edit Assignment page has also been translated and checking if other pages are translated. Some more test cases like checking if the change in language is reflected from a student login could have been included. The authors specify that Rspec and Capybara is used for testing the new feature.

problem The design feels simple and not much different from the one I saw in Round 1, in my perspective because I have already reviewed the project in the previous round. But, to a new reviewer it might not be that direct at first as they need to understand the base of the project and the first phase of implementation which is covered in the wiki document of the previous project.

problem The design encompasses all the features in the specification. It only indicates supporting one more language, though, whereas the design document specifies any language. It seems out of the scope of the project, but what if you used the Google's Cloud Translation API to translate the static strings at run time? Then you could support almost any language. There might be licensing issues though.
problem The design does not include any kind of diagram. It would have been better if a flowchart or a class diagram could have been included in the document.
problem The design does include enough test plans. The team has provided the code screenshots for the same. Suggestion: Could have put links to the git code so that the wiki could have been short and precise.
problem The design does appear to be sound. The team has put most of the use cases, actors and explained them well. The screenshots of the UI are also present. Suggestion: Could have explained the implementation a bit more in bullet points.

problem The design does appear to be sound, which involves the Rust implementation of the Web IDL files namely- OffScreenCanvas and OffScreenCanvasContext2D Web IDL file. I look forward to the complete implementation of the project.
problem The design does appear to be simple, as they have not planned to modify any of the existing methods. Their new method will interact with Response, AssignmentQuestionnaire model, and then link the assignment to the review in the email. However, they have not mentioned if they have planned any data structure/variable to store the assignment link and pass it on to the method where email notification will be sent. But, i suppose that storing it in a variable will suffice.

problem the design document seems to be well written and detailed with respect to the objectives that need to be achieved. The team explains well the purpose and project design. they have included the database tables which will be modified. the team could add a testing plan to make the design document look complete.
problem The design document seems to be incomplete. The team have done a good job explaining their problem statement and have included their implementation in brief. If the team could build up on this and explain their implementation in more detail while adding a few diagrams to explain the work they plan to do would be great. Also the team have not mentioned any test cases they plan to implement.

problem The design document is extremely well written. The project purpose is mentioned, although it looks similar to what is already mentioned in the Google design document. I would suggest the team to add their own understanding of the project, how this project is helpful to the system ? Why are these changes/project necessary ? Additionally I would also suggest the team to add a test plan section to their documentation. Any bugs fixed need to be tested thoroughly for edge cases as well as core fucntionality.

problem The design document is comprehensive and covers most of the relevant topics. General problem statement is defined clearly and then divided into multiple specific subtasks which will be addressed by the project. The solution to the problem specifies the library that will be utilized in the implementation and classifies several types of sorting that needs to be done. This is followed by the files that will be modified in the scope of this project. The primary problem is that the document does not provide any extensive discussion about the possible design decisions and implementation strategies. It is stated that scripts have been added at the top of the file to sort the contents of table. I would suggest elaborating on the specifics, what functions are called and how will the javascript function be tied to the html table contents.

Moreover, the document provides the files that are going to be changed by the team. The main problem of this design is that there is no detailed explanation or examples of what the final expectations are. I would suggest giving more specific examples of how the proposed API should work and what may be the main challenges of the implementation.

One minor improvement would be to highlight the parts associated with introduced changes that link html table with the library for better readability.
problem The design document appears really easy to follow. A person who is new to the project can get the summary of what is happening just by reading and going through the design document.
problem The design doc outlines each step that needs to be implemented and a simple implementation plan
problem The design doc looks more or less complete given that it is just phase one of the project. I feel that some screenshots and a more detailed explanation would have been better.
problem The design doc is well written , but they haven't specified any test plans. They've explained the steps well, but haven't written anything about tests.

problem The design doc is good and provides a clear picture about the objective of the project. However,It would also be nice to know what features would be tested in the test plan.
problem The design doc is disorganized and difficult to follow. There are no sections for project purpose, project design, or project testing. Consider adding these sections to give order to the document. Also, red front against a white background can be an eye strain for some.

problem The design doc contains project purpose, project design and testing plan in the wiki. The wiki contains mock visualizations which make it easy to understand the project proposal and how are they planning to do. The design flow as a flow chart adds to the ease of understanding. The test plan explains about the technologies that they are planning to use for testing. Suggestion:  The test plan could say what should be done in testing than just the technologies to be used for a particular part of code. For ed, we plan to have a dummy small data and see if the graphs output the visualizations correctly, if the sum id being counted to 100% of the class participation etc... the stacked version could also have been represented for better understanding.
problem The design diagram is good and it would also be helpful to have a few screenshots of the current expertiza view.
problem the design design dicument seems to be written well and organised into nice categories so as to be easily readable. Though the team hasn't  made any changes since the last update. The team could have added a UML diagram and test plan in order to better explain the project.

problem The design changes appear simple and clear. Only suggestion to the team would be to explain the design choices a little more. As mentioned above, give an example of how, where to use Bootstrap and Jumbotron.
problem The design appears to be specific to the requirements. For this, they have used a UML design which basically explains the flow of the use-case. They have not used any principles or design patterns. However, there does not seem a need to use any, as their changes are limited to the html view and making a call to the tablesorter using JQuery. As per the document, the design does not make any redundant changes or unnecessary changes to the code. Thus, they have done a good job by optimizing the changes.
problem The design appears to be sound for most part of it. The linking between the different sections seems appropriate. The only issue I have is with the mock-up in the Design Details -> Second Change mock-up number 2. I think that the bar chart is being displayed for each and every day. I feel that is not only highly unnecessary but also would be very overwhelming for the instructor to process all this information because:-i) It is common knowledge that many students do not begin projects until a few days/weeks would have passed since the assignment is posted. So that would leave the initial few days of the bar chart empty with nothing valuable to show.ii) The duration of each project varies from project to project. Assignment 2 had a duration of about 20 -30 days. This would mean that there would be about 20 bar charts for each day which would be quite difficult for the TA/instructor to process for just one team let alone for so many other teams they need to evaluate. Suggestions: Instead of providing bar chart for each day aggregate it to a bar chart for each week or one in 5 days. And then maybe towards the deadline or like a week before the deadline you could switch to 1 barchart per day. OR Provide an option to switch between the scaling of time periods like a week, 5 days, 1 day etc.

problem The design appears to be a bit complex, as it involves interactions with two controllers, viz. review_mapping_controller and report_controller. The changes should be checked thoroughly to not impact the existing methods of these controllers. Nevertheless, the design is complete in itself, and the authors have tried to keep it as modular and clear as possible. A very good job here!

problem The design appears appropriate, but since it is shallow, it is hard to tell how sound it is. How will a user be prevented from requesting another review? Also, the naming seems to assume either one or two rounds. What about more than two rounds?

problem The DB design is incomplete. Although it has the correct 1-to-n or n-to -n relationship, it doesn't have any kings of validation. 
problem The database schema, especially for the login / signup functionality is very well implemented, and includes lots of features that weren't asked for at the first place. So the extra hard-work is very well appreciated. The db design is very cohesive and seems fool-proof. The rest of the programs and the functionalities follow most of the principles for good ruby on rails coding practices. But, the one thing I find missing was the lack of proper documentation within the code. Given the short time frame, not having extensive documentation and comments within the code is excusable, but there were certain points where I had to go through the whole code to realize what;s happening, which could have been avoided if there was proper commenting inside the code. 
problem The database schema only consisted of the users table, and the CRUD functionalities on the MVC related to it. Due to the less amount of content to review, a proper justification for this question is a bit tough. Even though the amount of code was less, but it followed many of the good coding practices of ruby on rails, except a few. For example, he code lacked any sort of documentation or comments. It makes it tough for the reviewer or any other programmer to make sense of the code. But apart from that, the practices seemed fine. The variables were named appropriately, functions were named effectively, and the classes were defined definitely. 
problem The database handles all the relationships very well. On the downside, there is a flaw in database design - keeping a single user table and single role type means the same email address can not be used for both realtor and house hunter profiles. You can either create separate tables or more than one columns to determine if the same email has more than one role. 
problem The current tests written are good but it would be good if the team had pointed out the corner cases as wel such as - what happens if the deadline for self-review is exceeded? Does that mean the peer-review scores cannot be seen? Or is a default score of 0 is set?

problem The current document does not include a visualization tool- inclusion of such a tool would have made the document more readable.  Nevertheless the link to the Wiki of the previous document includes a flow diagram that clearly outlines the code flow of how the control flows from the incorporation of OffScreenCanvas web IDL file to its Rust implementation in OffScreenCanvas.rs, to the DOM implementation and finally to the renderer.

problem The coverage is actually decreased.
problem The coverage has increased from ~77% to ~94% which is impressive. However, the previous issue was that #scores method of Participant was not called because the object that is being tested in this project is an instance of AssignmentParticipant class. This problem was handled by commenting out the #scores method of AssignmentParticipant so that Participant #scores method will be called instead. This breaks other parts of the code which depend on AssignmentParticipant's #scores implementation. The solution to this problem is to either define a new Participant class instance in the factory or to define it in the test code itself.

problem The complexity is again a big unknown to me, as they have kept the algorithm as a black box. It is unclear where the algorithm changes are to be implemented, if it is in a controller, and if yes, in which controller. I suggest the authors to provide internal details of the algorithm in order to understand their proposed solution better. As of now, I am clear about their input and output formats, however I would like to know which functions do they interface with.

problem The code seems to work for basic required functionality. Need to add more number of edge cases with test results where there is a possibility of a failure and a look into the work around is required.
problem The code seems to set up a large list of factories only to then in many cases make these redundant by creating mocks for each test case. It is unclear what the code is trying to do and many of the test cases are large with many mocks with stubbed methods. It would be helpful if explanation for the code was given. When using factories it is generally unnecessary to stub the all the methods of these factories as they are in fact actual instances of the class. The code not very DRY. In many the cases the mocks and stubbed methods could be moved to a before_all or before_each block.

Other than that, capybara test cases could have made it strong to go to the production server. If they feature did work the way as it was shown in the screencast, it can be deployed to production.

problem The code seemed to be well written in the first round. But I dont see changes done in round 2. The github link provided shows last commit for Oct 21. Though I see that there are change made in the wiki which were required and are done well.
problem The code quality is well written. Many of the functions are doing only one thing at a time. The only limitation I could observe is lack of comments in controller as well model.

problem The code quality is good however, it can be improved significantly. The code lacks proper comments and contains many if else statements. They could have been refactored and avoided.

problem The code quality is fairly standard, the code practices DRY principles fairly well. I would suggest creating new controllers for managing house hunters and realtors from admin profile since, on creating a new realtor/house hunter the admin logs out and this seems like stop gap fix.

problem The code quality in this application looks good. I didn't see any extremely large methods, views were clean and simple, and controllers had one-to-one mappings with application-level functions.  I do think I would encourage this team to consider using scopes in their models next time as I did not see many here.
problem The code passes for the Travis build as well as Danger Bot. However, it fails for code climate with 3 issues yet to be fixed. In totality, the pull request does satisfy the need to pass the required builds.
problem The code passes almost all Travis CI . However, there are really few which fail.

problem The code on Github has 1-to-n relationship between real estate company and realtor. It also facilitates realtors to create real estate companies of their own. My doubt is whether the realtor can view, update and delete the real estate company created by him, because I could not find such a functionality implemented in the application as well as the code.

problem The code looks very clean. I am a big fan of the set up of the describe/context/it nesting that clearly defines the test cases' purpose. I am confused why there are two classes being tested in this spec. Is the purpose of this class to test Node or to test Menu? If two classes are being tested they should perhaps have separate rspec files to make clear the point. However, the actual syntax and implementation of your tests is beautiful.
problem The code looks to be ready to be deployed on production, but would appreciate to have a few more tests run prior to it.
problem The code looks great. It's all scaffolding and really lean view modifications.

problem The code looks comprehensive to a good extent with the usage of comments and clear naming. 1. Adding the not interested feature is a plus point. 2. The naming is done well with attention to the singular and plural nouns for models and controllers. 3. No problem with respect to the coding clarity.

problem The code itself is fairly clean and readable. The class ListOfPotentialBuyers is poorly named, and I'm not sure you need a separate class for it.
problem The code itself appears to be very clean. The lack of scaffolding (or the stripped down scaffolding that it presents) means there's a lot less dead code in the files. All the indentation and variable names appear to follow convention as well. This cleanliness, on further inspection, appear to stem from the fact that the application frequently does not support needed functionality. The code that's there is clean though.

problem The code is well written. Although as suggested earlier, the team has not added comments to the code. In the wiki page, the team displays of how the code was before and after. But, I still feel this is not adequate information for a layman to be able to follow line by line what the code does. Adding comments in the code for future projects would be my best suggestion. Or, as an alternative, briefly explain in a line or 2 as to what the code does.
problem The code is well written, tested and documented and hence I think it should be ready to be deployed. 
problem The code is well written, follows ruby guidelines and variables are aptly named. However, the changes are extensive and there are virtually no comments. The code can do with significantly more comments to explain what is being done.

Rubric Array can be declared outside the function, so as to follow DRY principle.  2. Meaningful comments can be included for the function definition in tree_display.jsx, explaining what does the tree_display represent
problem The code is well written and follows all the DRY problems.  The team has changed the files based on previous reviews and to make it more DRY comments before the methods that they created gave a better understanding what each code does. // function for showing warning when number of slots is set as zero   Changing the names that suited the functionality more, is appreciated. addCreateTopicSection() appendCreateTopicSection()

problem The code is very well written as previously said. However, some test cases are still not passing and that may be troublesome if deployed onto production server. It would be a really nice opportunity for students in further classes take this up and improve the work so that they can complete the work which was left incomplete due to time constraints.
problem The code is very neat and easy to read, but i can tell it is the auto generated code from scaffold. 
problem The code is very modular and clean. There is no bad naming in the project, naming conventions are followed. All the methods are concise. There are not many nested blocks and the code is clear and easy to understand. However the functionality of creating a house is written under inquiry which makes it difficult for the user to comprehend the flow of the website.
problem The code is structured well and is straightforward to follow. Test blocks are succinct and contain one assertion per block. The project has been greatly improved since the 1st round. Naming and indentation issues have been fixed. Furthermore, significant work has been done for the code to be consistent with Code Climate. One suggestion would be to elaborate on the #score method. Decomposition could be used to extract the common set up into a separate before(:each) block and test expectations using multiple 'it' statements as opposed to having everything asserted in one 'it' block.

problem The code is really well written , there are no bad names. The functions are also easy to understand. However, I would suggest them to include more comments in the code so that it becomes clear for the person reading the code that what the function and changes are all bout.
problem The code is ready to be deployed on production server with few caveats. At some places values and logic is hardcoded. This project would be a really good starting point for further work.

problem The code is readable and no function is too long. Suggestion: The impersonating_as_admin? and impersonating_as_ta? function uses the same session variable, so you can try to declare it above these functions and reuse it to follow DRY principle

problem The code is much clean and readable. All the functions are short and crisp with proper indentation . However, mostly they have tried to embed the functionalities which could have been separate to be in the basic crud functions provided by rails. for eg. here , they haven't maintained a different function for the potential buyer , instead they have used a hash for it which is embedded in the show functionality of the house controller

problem The code is functionally ready to be deployed in the production server, because it is sound and even passes the build of Travis CI. There are a few minor issues due to Cognitive Complexity of names of methods, lines of code and a few indentation errors. If they are fixed, the code is complete and will pass the build of codeclimate as well. The team has proceeded in the correct approach and there is no need for the project to be redone from scratch using a different approach.

problem The code is concise and readable. It consists of mostly small methods that test one thing. One exception is #.sort_by_name method where several assertions are made in one method. It would be better to use several 'it' statements and DRY out the code by utilizing before(:each) statement. One further suggestion would be to shorten the code by using one array statements instead of individual expressions.

problem The code is clean and readable. Every method handles only one task. However there are two controllers for house hunters and realtors which I felt was redundant.

Methods have been written concisely and in a readable way.

problem The code is clean and readable, but there's only one suggestion. The page which lists houses (index) and search houses are handled by different controllers, whereas, they could have been easily integrated into one, without compromising code readability. It would have lead to a more integrated and a cohesive web app. In one or two instances, there were several functions performed within a function, which could have been better modularised too.
problem The code is clean and easy to follow and each method handles one task. I could not understand the reason for some of the code, like the home action in the hunters_controller - the current user's role is set to 3 without any checks. So if the url is visited directly and user's role is something else, it will be set to 3 and saved, which can result in wrong behaviours. Overall code is well written/

problem The code is almost perfect, apart from the code complexity issues, which in my view isn't very tough to fix. The project need not be done from scratch, and it is certainly a good starting place for future teams to pick up.
problem The code is almost perfect except for the lack of proper commenting. The author has not improved or updated the ocde since the last review, as the last commit was about 11 days back.
problem The code is almost completed. Only a few final touches will make it ready to be deployed onto the production server. Maybe the future team can also work on it to achieve some more enhanced features.
problem The code in this project generally appears to be readable. Home controller should probably have a different name, just because controllers are generally supposed to be plural, but there is only one home in their website. Their house search controller appears to be in the model section of the project though.

problem The code in the project (not auto generated by Ruby) appears to follow the guidelines presented in class and by the style guidelines. The user model contains appropriate validations/syntax, while additional files contain appropriate usage of parenthesis, symbols, and pluralization of file names. Be careful about long lines. In the repo I can't necessarily see the column number; however, but don't be afraid to break parameters up for readability. I believe the guidelines suggest not going out past col 80. I appreciate your indentation. A simple thing can make all the difference in the readability of a file.

Indentation issues in app/models/assignment_participant.rb There are no conflicts with the base branch.
problem The code has not been deployed. But according to the video, the workflow has been demonstrated properly. Out of the 3 issues, 2 have been resolved. One is not done. 
problem The code has mast elements ready but there can be more test cases generated with better test coverage. The code need not be rewritten from scratch, it just needs to include some more of the expected functionality
problem The code has good style and recognizable convention over configuration. There are some line spacing issues however.
problem The code has good style and recognizable convention over configuration. There are some line spacing issues however.
problem The code has comments at the beginning of the functionality. Could have added some more comments where the functions are larger for followup. Can add why a certain change in the fetching process was made, so that next time it can be referred while coding further.
problem The code has been written as per the coding standard. The code written by the team adheres to dry principle. However, as per my first review comments it is advisable to follow better naming conventions. The team could rename their function names such as the below one to something smaller such as get_time_diff. The code needs refactoring in names and addition of comments.  def get_time_diff_btw_due_date_and_now(due_date)

problem The code has been very well written and it follows all the coding practices. There could have been few more comments but other than that I don't see any other problem.
problem The code has been modified to include the modifications requested (test cases added for failing scenarios and edge cases - two assignments with same name) in my previous review. Appreciated! Overall the code quality is good. Only some variable names are ambiguous for example: check_validate.  What does it validate? Name it like validate_same_name or validate_common_directory etc
problem The code has been merged in a good way and there have been no merge conflicts. The build did pass the Travis CI. The code climate test failed but those were small issues which can easily fixed by just revisiting the code.
problem The code has been merged in a good way and there have been no merge conflicts. However, the Travis CI was failing and the code climate check was failing too. This is something that the team must look into and make sure that the changes that they have made are consistent with the existing expertiza code.

problem The code has been implemented in a modular way. However, there are few functions where Ruby naming conventions has not been followed for example : "authenticateAdmin" in UsersController class.
problem The code has been implemented in a modular fashion. However, the team can improve the readability of the code in mail_worker  and assignment_form. Currently it lacks readability because of too long comments between every line of code and poor alignment, which makes it difficult for user to understand.
problem The code has been implemented as per the Ruby standards of coding. However, there are few instances of code could be better handled such as the index function in admin controller.

problem The code has been implemented as per the Ruby standards of coding. However, the author has used numeric ids for role comparison which is difficult to map with the code. It would have been more meaningful if the author could use the names of role so that it could be easily understood. Also, it could be more easier for the reader if the author could avoid lot of commented code. Specially in main classes such as "UsersController". Instance from code for point 1: if user.id == 19   current_user.role = 1   current_user.save   else   current_user.role = 0

problem The code has almost no comments. I found some lint, particularly some commented-out blocks of code. 
problem The code generally is simple and understandable. Blocks are simple but maybe its because few features are missing.

problem The code follows the good coding practices. However, there are some instances where I found commented lines of code in the controller. Ex. house_hunters_controller.rb lines 23-25 and users_controller.rb function switch_role
problem The code follows the DRY principle and the Ruby style guide for writing the test cases. The code could be improved by providing comments. The code contains optimum length methods and the variables and functions have been properly named.
problem The code follows the common "Ruby on rails" application structure: Hence, it was easy for me to navigate through other files to see portion of the code. It follows the common MVC structure. However, In some parts of the code, comments were missing which was confusing as I didn't understand the logic for that code. README file was not properly described for other users navigating through app. 
problem The code follows ruby and rails convention, but there are multiple commented files in the project such as logins.coffee and many more which have not been used in the application. 
problem The code follows on the lines of good ruby on rails practices. However, I can see no migrations in the db folder. The readme file contains sql statements for table completion which look to be correct.

problem The code follows most of the standard practices except the 3rd one. It does falls short of comments. It took a very long time to make sense of what the changes made by the author in a particular file does. This scenario could be improved in the future iterations.

problem The code follows good coding style, adheres to naming standards and is DRY. However, the suggested changes since last round have not been implemented which emphasized on shortening the length of long functions create and view.
problem The code enables properly testing the various features and describes the system working as desired. However, since the Travis build did not pass, the code could be deployed but with careful intervention by the developer. It could be taken up from here and does not require to be redone from scratch.
problem The code employed good naming and seemed to be DRY and follow standard Ruby on Rails practices. The methods were kept short. HouseInterestList would make more sense as HouseInterest. Each row in the table is one wish list entry, not a list of wish list entries.
problem The code does its functionality, but it's not tested.  My biggest concern would be to have the test cases written for it before the production version.  It is a good starting place for a future team to pick up and just cover the test cases.

problem The code does follow all the standards and steps to cover all the test cases. Could include some more comments to make the code self explanatory. 
problem The code coverage is 100%. Every test case passes after a manual check.
problem The code contributed does not follow the test rule in that the tests are made using create instead of build. The code functions do not implement much function and does not follow the Ruby style guide. The team should focus on getting the tests running by following the DRY principle. 
problem The code contributed by the author contains long functions which are adequate and consistent considering the amount of task that is carried by each function. The team could improve upon the comments to enable high understanding of the flow of code written. The code does follow the Ruby style guide and supports the DRY principle.

problem The code contains comments which makes it little hard to read through.Other than that the organisational way, refactoring methods are handled good
problem The code consists of small methods that mostly test one thing. This results in high readability. The team has made an extensive use of 'context' constructs which further enhance the code documentation. Moreover, the team has improved the .sort_by_name method making it cleaner and easier to follow. This was complemented by the fix of bad names that were present in the first round (e.g. stu1, p1 etc.). One suggestion pertaining to the '#scores' block would be to use specific assertions of fields instead of testing the object via inspect method and comparing it to the string value.
problem The code changes in "app/controllers/submitted_content_controller.rb" line 60-78, could have been in a separate method, such as send "email to reviewers". That would make the controller code clean and clear.     Code changes does not follow the DRY principle in atleast two places. 1.  In app/mailers/delayed_mailer.rb, there is no need to duplicate the code. The code in the new method, review_reminder_email  has been copied from email_reminder. The email_reminder method can be used instead of creating a separate method altogether.   2. app/models/assignment_participant.rb and app/models/course_participant.rb uses a same code to send the emails via MailerHelper.send_mail_to_user , that can be put in one place, so that it can be reused in both the places.      
problem The code changes are very less, so not much to say about refactoring, DRY problems etc. The code has "put" statements which are also pointed out by the code climate bot.Having put conditions is not a good coding style, the authors could have considered to remove the statements. puts "hi, im in import" puts name.to_s The authors could have debugged to see the flow of code, or remove them before committing.

problem The code changes are accepted but build does not pass travis CI. The problem statement is simple and team has implemented a clean solution for the same.
problem The code can definitely be deployed but once the 3 pending code climate issues(I believe the 3 are to be resolved by he mentor) and the Travis CI build have been rectified. Suggestion: Rectify the Travis CI issues.
problem The code can definitely be deployed but once the 3 pending code climate issues(I believe the 3 are to be resolved by he mentor) and the Travis CI build have been rectified. Suggestion: Rectify the Travis CI issues.
problem The code can be readily merged into production. 1) I felt code climate failing not an issue, because their similar blocks of code were on spec files and deleting 2 different roles is the same functionality in the end. Few places has indentation errors which can be fixed before merging. As suggested earlier, removing the error for SQL and replacing with some form of alert box could be helpful for a future work.
problem The code can be deployed once the Travis CI passes and there are some 6 minor warnings to be fixed in code climate. There are 4 failing and 1 successful checks, the team needs to make sure these checks pass in order to be able deploy the code onto the production server.
problem The code build passes the travis CI test and it has not  conflicts with the base branch. However, the team should resolve warnings.

problem The changes proposed by the authors are reasonable, they do not introduce any clutter or inconsistencies to the code. However, issues #1017 and #1072 do not have a clear solution. In one case changes to the assignment controller are proposed but it cannot be inferred how adequate those changes will be.
problem The changes proposed by the authors are elaborate overall. They have defined the changes extensively. However, the "Search for Reviews" section could have elaborated more about the search functionality.

problem The changes being proposed is not comprehensive. The changes in the controller is not mentioned at all. The current issue and end picture are also very hard to follow.

problem The basics test are written. Some application specific tests can be written.
problem The basic test cases mentioned in the read me work fine. It does not cover the edge cases as mentioned above, but some of the validations I tried seem to have worked.
problem The basic functionalities work nicely. Creating houses, signup and signin, house search, inquiry and reply etc work correctly. All the validations are present. However a few functionalities are not working:  1. A house without a photo can not be seen (Error in showing the house) 2. Houses information (index) is shown incorrectly - Forgot to add table headings?  3. Potential buyer functionality not implemented correctly - Can not see any details, just show, edit,delete options 4. Admin can not delete companies, houses or realtors if they are referenced elsewhere - see next answer below for details. 5. Realtor cannot reply to inquiry and cannot destroy his house. 7. Admin can not see inquiries even when some are there.  
problem The basic functionalities are working as mentioned in the write-up. Refactoring the code would hamper a few functionalities as there are multiple instances where a single function is performing different actions
problem The bar charts have been added to the design report. The visualizations have been added to views also and the screen shots have been added too. The only thing that I would like to add is that the bar charts could have been more descriptive. As in they could have added details for  x label and y label and also put legend. this will aid the user in quickly understanding what the chart is conveying.

problem The AWS deployment attempted by the team does not work. I attempted to clone the repository and run it locally but was unable to. Looking at the code itself, I was able to determine that the wishlist, replying to an inquiry functionalities are missing.  I am unsure why the team opted use the devise model generator for the companies model. The companies aren't a type of user on this project from my understanding and rather a resource. Would it be possible for the team to use a scaffold generate instead?

problem The authors work functions well but the code uses redundant/bad logic in some places. Code could have been put into methods and reused. The code functions as expected in almost all cases
problem The authors view of the final result is clear, but it is not yet clear on how the project is going to be implemented. i.e what files are going to be changed.
problem The authors used a lot of charts for use cases, this is great, but they only explained a little for implementation, which could be explained in a great detail.

problem The authors talk about adding the tablesorter class to the html table and using javascript scripts for further action. There are no apparent problems with this strategy, however I would suggest for the team to elaborate and provide more details on the implementation. For example, it is not possible to understand what the javascript part will look like, how many functions will be used or how they will interact with html.

problem The authors seem to have understood the project and know what changes need to be made to what files. The changes seem to be targeted to the correct classes and preliminary investigation reveals that it does seem to follow DRY principles. They might want to make their design diagram more simplified which will not only help in making it look readable and also help in implementing the code effectively. This will help in reducing convoluted code.

problem The authors provide a list of files that will be modified in the scope of this project and a high level overview of what needs to be done. The rationale behind using a tablesorter jQuery library and defining the code in the script seems reasonable but the team needs to discuss more details to further clarity the solution.

problem The authors propose two changes and have mentioned in detail about the flow in which they will make changes. They could benefit from drawing simple LoFi UI cards to illustrate how the new review page might look like which will benefit them in improving their UI design and proper representation of data before they actually spend the man hours in coding it.

problem The authors propose changes in an extremely concise manner. The idea that the team proposes to follow seems logical, but I would suggest them to include a dummy example or sample pseudocode so that the english explanantion is backed up with an idea of the code as well. Such as this-: 1) Review X is submitted 2) Loop through Review 1......n If abs(Review n score - Review X score) >= (some value) store Review n URL in list  
problem The authors propose a sound logic to improve the functionality required. However, I would suggest the team to think about looping over each and every review. This may increase the response time of the system. Perhaps more interaction with the instructors could help the team come up with a less complex solution.

problem The authors only provided diagrams to state what the UI likes now but not provide any diagrams to explain how the system will be like after changes. Especially, they didn't explain the components they will use, it is more difficult for me to understand what kind of results they intended to get after changes.
problem The authors only explain what needs to be changed but no specific steps. If would be better if they can provide more details about how will they implement the functions they mention in the document.

Little to no discussion is provided on the overall decisions pertaining to design principles and patterns that have been utilized in this project. For example, there are no instances of before(:each) blocks in the source code. This decision could be discussed and clarified in the wiki page.

problem The authors have worked well since the last review and incorporated some of the suggestions. They have now finalized the input and output formats. However, I still am unsure about the algorithm implementation they have proposed. They have kept it as a black box, which makes the design quite inadequate. It becomes difficult to review if their methods, classes are in the right direction or need any modification. They should have at least given a high level overview of the algorithm. Also, I have observed that the additional comments box also contains valuable suggestions many of the times. Please mention if you have considered the additional comments box in your analyze functionality.

problem The authors have talked about only the UI and not the underlying code. So it is difficult to assess the quality of the change. As far as the UI is concerned the authors have taken a right direction to place the checkbox. Providing further details about the proposed solution including the changes  needed in the controller code to support the UI change will help explain it.
problem The authors have taken efforts to identify the right places for making the identified changes. It seems that they have already done some changes. Suggestions: I feel that the proposed changes on a high level. You might want to go a level deeper to explain what will your changes be like. You might also consider adding use case for your changes.

problem The authors have put in a good amount of effort in creating LowFI sketch (table) of the Grade Summary view with mock data. They have included a rough prototype of the intended view with all student and assignment information. The documentation also shows the Manage Courses view which contains the 360 Assessment icon that links to the Grade Summary page. One suggestion is that the team could have touched upon some implementation detail like showing the code flow as a flowchart or even useful UML diagrams for usecases.
problem The authors have provided use cases for creating new subclass of Questionnaire, SupplementaryReviewQuestionnaire. However, more details can be added to the implementation section such as what new methods will be doing and test plans.

problem The authors have provided a minimal explanation of the changes to be made. They have mentioned about the UI changes and not discussed further. It would be good to include the underlying changes. The team has identified a view file under the potentially modified files. They have not explored the controller and other files that need to be modified in order to support this. A design document needs to holistically portray your design and so it will be great if such details could be included.
problem The authors have provided a high level view of the changes which are suposed to be made to the system. But since the author hasn't implemented anything until now, it is tough to justify the changes proposed by the author.
problem The authors have provided a high level solution to the problem statement.  They have mentioned that they are going to use an API for suggestion detection, but have not yet identified one. Suggestion: You can survey on the existing APIs and discuss about at least two of them in depth and specify which one you feel is more compatible with expertiza. This will improve your write-up significantly.

problem The authors have provided a brief design approach of storing the URL and looping it into an email notification, so that instructor would be able to identify which review has been mapped to it. Improvisation: You can try adding information about new functions you wish to add, and if yes, which of the files identified by the mentor do you want to add the function to. This will increase the depth of your design document.

problem The authors have proposed to create a view for Grade Summary with the details pertaining to the assignment grades, topics, review scores and total scores for each student which gets rendered when a 360 Assessment tab icon is clicked. This change seems logical. They have also depicted a LowFI sketch of the projected page and screenshot of a rough prototype. These changes seem logical to me. I wonder if they are going to reuse any existing code that they cited as prior work in the background. The documentation could have added specifics of the files that they wish to modify or create.
problem The authors have proposed changes that they are planning to implement. However, they have not included how they will go on to implement these changes.

problem The authors have proposed changes that they are planning to implement. However, they have not included how they will go on to implement these changes. 
problem The authors have portrayed their work by adding many code snippets. It is cumbersome to go through the entire code in the write-up. A general approach towards refactoring principles used would have been impressive.
problem The authors have only mentioned about adding a checkbox field to the view. More changes will be required in order to enforce the deadlines on the students. Suggestion: Add a section called Design Plan to the wiki and mention a rough idea of how you are going to approach the project.
problem The authors have not specified any implementation specific detail pertaining to the specific controller classes that they propose to modify. So I am not in a position to comment if they are making changes in the wrong class or if it will make the code smelly. The design looks precise and there is no need of any additional gems.  The response time of the system should typically not take so long unless the view is rendering extraordinarily many student and assignment information. The team could implement an effective searching algorithm or use of an efficient data structure to store the student grade information. Or, they could possibly use filters to generate only relevant students (say under a specific course, year at a given University ) The authors have put in good effort in the design documentation except for minor additions (like code modifications, file changes and UML diagrams) which can be easily incorporated by the next review.
problem The authors have not specified any code changes as of now so I can't comment on it. Suggestion: You might want to add any API Adapter class you plan to implement to generalize the solution for any future API implementations.

problem The authors have made a really good attempt at explaining the changes to be made, however, I feel like few details could have been added to the previously done work and how they are going to improve it. 
problem The authors have lucidly explained the changes that are to be made to the system. They show the current state of the system and the expected state which includes a new button to Analyze the review content in the segmented text box. The authors have specified 2 files that they plan to modify namely the view file response.html.erb and a partial _self_review.html.erb. The team clearly show the format of the response popup with suggestion metrics that capture sentiment score, sentiment tone, whether suggestions are present or not, chance of suggestions, volume of text and the volume of text without stop words. They also propose to improve the response time of extracting the output from the API.One suggestion is that the team could have touched upon the working of the suggestion detection algorithm though it is not part of their current implementation. They do mention that it is a black box and have included a link to the deployed NLP project for suggestion algorithm, where users can test the suggestion metrics generated for custom text.
problem The authors have just mentioned that they are going to do some testing since it is mostly ui based. I would have liked if they could at least give details of steps in each test scenario that could be performed to execute the case, even that is missing. This section is incomplete and would have liked if the authors could put in more effort and details on how to do this
problem The authors have just mentioned that the test cases were updated. It would be good if the code diff for the test case modification were also provided so that we get an idea about the kind of changes made.
problem The authors have included the different tests that they wrote, however a description of what the test is testing would be helpful.

problem The authors have included all the necessary sections of the design document. However, the document seems to be a very high-level explanation of the problem statement and proposed solutions. Suggestion: You can try elaborating more on the problem statement and the current scenario of the project. e.g. Try explaining what is the threshold for sending an email notification to the users.

problem The authors have included a UML diagram which explains a flow of the diagram The document does not strike a balance in the use of visualization. It lacks at illustrating the changes using appropriate use-cases, mock-up screens to show the expected changes as opposed to the current scenario. The mock-up screen can include sorted values of the field whose headers you clicked upon. Also, there is no need of other visualization aids such as class diagrams, as the modifications are limited to views.

problem The authors have included a flowchart which concisely explains the functionality that the authors are going to add. They have also included 2 screenshots of the UI, showing the end result in the 'after' image. UML diagrams are not included. Please add, will give an understanding of how the implementation will be done.
problem The authors have improved the part of the document that describes the interactions between html and javascript parts since the 1st round. While this assignment does not require an extensive discussion about the design principles or patterns, it would be better if the document explicitly addressed this topic.

problem The authors have explained well what changes they wish to make and how they plan to implement those changes. I would suggest them to add more details like, "where do they store the list of responses more than the notification threshold". Overall good job.
problem The authors have explained well regarding their design approach to support Hindi language but it has not mentioned if their design is flexible enough to add another languages in the future. I think they can mention if their design can accomodate other languages easily or not.

problem The authors have explained well on what changes they want to make but it is unclear how it will be implemented. As I had suggested in my previous review, they can mention the expertiza files (controllers, views) involved. 
problem The authors have explained the scope of the project pretty well. But as I mentioned in the earlier review, a whole paragraph on the background of expertiza is not required, one or two sentences would have sufficed.

problem The authors have explained the changes to be made to the system, including screenshots of the tables, UML diagrams as well as all the files that will be modified. Suggestion: Although all the details are explained well in the document, by writing the changes proposed to the files in bullet points or by using a diagram the document will be easier to read.
problem The authors have explained about their changes neatly, including previous suggestions. They have added detailed description about tablesorter which they plan to implement. The tablesorter is used to sort data for multiple fields for a table, using multi-tbody sorting. They plan to use it in the grades and review_mapping views. They do not plan to implement in their drop-down, but display the sorted data itself on loading the page.  The changes look more clear to me, as they have been able to implement the changes in the table view using multi-tbody sorting for submissions table. I think that introduction to Expertiza is highly unnecessary and should be removed,

problem The authors have documented the steps they did to solve the issues. Although they haven't mentioned any particular design principles or design thinking that went on in solving the issues. They should have  explained all the functionalities of each file they have modified and stated why they have modified the particular file. One thing they could have added were class diagrams and dependency maps. Or some pictorial representation of the flow of each task which will help the reviewers and instructors to quickly catch up on their idea.

problem The authors have described 1-2 solutions of the problem. However, I would suggest them to include more about how these changes will be done and where are these changes going to occur, what files will be affected etc.
problem The authors have considered various preconditions but edge cases are not tested. No test plan has been provided. Some tests have been edited to meet the new requirements. Many conditions have been checked using 'if else' cases which could have been more elegant.
problem The authors have considered the requirements and accordingly designed their solutions. The proposed UI design looks very intuitive and the abstract understanding of the code seems to good. However, the implementation is required to say definitely if it makes the code smelly
problem The authors have adequately explained the changes made to the system. Ot would have been better if some visual modes are added.
problem The authors have added the screenshots from github which clearly shows the code change. But since there are many changes, the explanation in the wiki is small. A better way would have been to put the links to the git files where the changes are made and there could be more explanations instead. This would also reduce the size of the wiki.

problem The authors have added the methods in the right class. The code is refactored properly. Appropriate gems have been used. The new system does not increase the response time and is efficient. More effort could have been put in the documentation by providing more UML diagrams and also by designing a test plan.

problem The authors gave enough explanations about the design for the UI parts. That is,  how will they design the UI and handle the problems related to UI, but they didn't give the design for how will they deal with the reviews differently when instructors check or uncheck the box. I cannot identify how can they check if the box is checked in the code, and how can they according to the status of the box to make sure the students can only update the previous reviews when the box is unchecked and students can require new reviews when the box is checked.
problem The authors explain the project pretty well, they also provide a diagram to show the relationship between different sets. However, the solution can be more detailed and maybe cover some edge cases.

Furthermore, they provide a list of files that are going to be changed in the scope of this project. However, the document would be more complete if the authors provided more details about specifics of changes. For example the description of high level changes pertaining to the OffscreenCanvasContextRendering2D is adequate, but it would be better if the authors elaborated on the code that is going to be filtered out.

problem The application hasn't been deployed (or they forgot to submit the deployed link).  
problem The application has really come a long way from the previous submission. I believe most of the page routes follow an appropriate application flow. There are several of the dependencies that are evidently not implemented do to the following observations: (1) Users are able to assign him/herself a Real Estate Company that doesn't exist in the system. This assignment should only be made with existing companies to fulfill the requirement of mapping a realtor to a single company. This missing dependency also reflects in the creation of houses. Realtors are able to create houses that are not listed with the company that the realtor is associated with. This association should be automatically made according to the company assigned to the realtor. (2) Users can be both a hunter and a realtor at the same time and can switch back and forth. How do you differentiate between a users abilities? Probably the best option would be to only allow users to be either a house hunter or a realtor. That would eliminate some of the ambiguities is associations and some unnecessary profile fields like house hunters having a real estate company. (3) Inquiries are not associated with houses. This posses an issue with knowing what property the house hunter is requesting information about. Overall, there have been great advances in your application since the first submit. Continue implementing those dependencies so that the required associations can hold.

problem The application code is properly divided into modules. the controller have defined functions for various tasks. The functionalities of interest list , potential buyers , replies to inquires are missing from the application. Class Reg1 is not a proper name for the class . Also the class is included in the houses controller which is not a good programming practice. The developers should have created a new controller for the Reg1 class. The validations are missing for Company details. Also separate sessions are created for different user types.

problem The admin is unable to destroy a real estate company due to the above mentioned dependency bug on the model files. Since all users are listed in a common view without information about who is a realtor and who is a house hunter, the admin would be unable to specifically test removing a type of user unless he/she creates one themselves. On changing real estate company through update for a realtor, the real estate company change was reflected else where, updation has been implemented well. The realtor is also unable to see the inquires or reply to them.

problem Tests have been implemented for a model and a controller. However, I believe that they are not exhaustive. Only one test case which will succeed has been implemented. You should try to implement more test cases, like what happens when one of the things which is mandatory is absent. Further, I am afraid that the tests are not testing the correct thing. For eg, should create real_estate_company tests  assert_redirected_to "/real_estate_companies/#{r.id}" while it should be testing if the company can be saved.

problem Suggested changes related to naming convention are not included in the 2nd round.  variable names : rop_topic_deadline1 , topic_id1 Puts statements are not removed : p topic_id1   Other than this the code is properly written following coding best practices.  
problem Success in edge case testing is determined by the association of the module, to self or with other modules. Many edge cases in this application are dependent on relationships between modules. For example, because houses are not properly associated with realtors or companies, reassigning a realtor's company appears to have no affect. Administrators are not able to delete users or companies, but  I would image it would not throw an error. There are cases that I tested that dealt specifically around the models. Example: user accounts can be created with the same email accounts as long as they are of different user types. This and other edge cases of it type proved successful. It would be great to have edge case information listed in the ReadMe to clarify how these cases were dealt with. Again, implementing the necessary dependencies between models will help to eliminate many of these edge case issues.

problem Since, they have not come up with a perfect solution, it seems they have been working on that.
problem Since, there is no readme file, admin access is not clear or how to navigate to those features. So most of the cases could not be checked due to ambiguity in the flow.
problem Since, the git repo link of their hasn't been given it can't be certainly said how well the code has been written. But going by their video in which they have meticulously explained step by step what they have done, I would day It is reasonably well executed and follows the Ruby style conventions. 
problem Since, the  project was not deployed hence manual testing could not be performed. But, the screencasts show that the system works as intended.

problem Since the first round, authors seem to have progressed a lot, and added most of the missing functionalities. However, following are some of them I found missing: 1.There is no potential buyer's list for a house that can be viewed by a realtor., however there is a link to the house inquiries. 2. I am not able to associate a company to my profile as a realtor. The realtor should be able to work for only one company, however, here I am able to add multiple companies, which should be restricted to admin only. 3. preconfigured admin - unable to login to the system as admin
problem Since the document is mostly copy pasted from the problem statement, it covers what needs to be done. But it has not discussed about how it needs to be done. Adding the exact changes to be made makes it easier to understand the solution proposed.
problem Since the code is not deployed, manually testing cannot be performed. But, the screencast shows that all the manual testing is passed.
problem Since the code coverage has decreased and the video demonstrates a proper working
problem Since the app threw an exception on the homepage and was unusable, this score reflects what was achieved in round 1. 27/35 basic functionalities passing corresponds to 77% or four stars. The screenshots in the README.md only demonstrated definitively features that were working in the last version.

problem Since I was unable to run the code on my local device, I am unable to test for edge cases. However I would suggest adding a destroy dependency in model files, for example for house hunters, has_many :inquiries, dependent: :destroy The README file fails to provide an information about edge cases.

problem Scenarios that are discussed in the wiki have comprehensive descriptions and justifications. However, clearly a number of edge cases are not considered as the test coverage is ~77%.   I would suggest using mock objects which will both decouple tests from database and increase the overall coverage.  For example mocking find_by method of TeamsUser would allow covering participant#team case: allow(TeamsUser).to receive(:find_by).with(user: student).and_return(team)   Another minor issue is that wiki is missing some cases that are implemented in the code (#team, #fullname, #scores).

problem Project name could have been better. Methods were kept small. Comments were left out in some controllers/views. If-else blocks weren't properly indented in some cases. Hard-coded numbers were used for comparisons. A better way is to create enums representing different values(such as roles) and using those enums in code. This way, something like if role == 2 becomes if role == REALTOR and thus is more clear.

problem Overall, the writeup was pretty good. Everything is explained in a good way with the help of code snippets and screenshots. There is definitely lack of explanation on how to check the work. THis is the only thing that I found where the writeup could've focussed more. Other than that it looks good.
problem Overall, the report was concise and fairly clear about what changes were being made to the system. However, the need for the Rails Internationalization API in addition to the Google's Cloud Translation API was not explained. Also, the report mentioned that strings in the actual code were not changing, which should have been explained in more detail.

problem Overall, the code looks fine. Good code is self-documenting - So, your code could be improved by adding comments in all required places. Make use of different logging options provided by ROR and avoid using "puts" in code.
problem Overall, the code is very well-written and follows all the best coding practices. But what I feel is a few more comments could help in improving the readability of the code. Also, there were few console debug statements which were causing the code-climate checks to fails. These could be removed or logged into Rails log.

problem Overall, it's good. Also in houses_controller.rb, the logic in the find_houses method should have been moved to the corresponding model. Application logic should be moved to the model. The admins_controller found in app/controllers is empty. What's it for? Also, when it comes to naming, house_controller and home_controller seems confusing.

problem Overall, I think it could be deployed. There are no tests however written for this functionality, and there are some UI patterns that should be re-considered before deploying that do not match each other. When saving feedback, the ability to save feedback is automatically present and there is a button per row, while in the other location, you must first make a row "editable".

problem Overall, code is clean and readable. Naming and project structure is consistent with good practices. One issue that stood throughout the code is that authorization is done directly in controller methods. It would be better if this common functionality was moved to a separate function call (e.g. validating user's role in houses_controller#create method)

problem Overall work is done good. But Explanations are bit lengthy and somewhat hard to follow. Ther is no need to mention the existing code.Which simplymmakes the documentation lengthier.
problem Overall well written code. Use of factory bot reduces code redundancy in building test cases. The team could have reduced the code redundancy inthe menu method test example.
problem Overall this was a usable system. However, This app did not do a good job of keeping track of my session. Once I edited that admin account, I could not navigate via links to the home page and was also asked to sign-in again if I clicked "admin sign-in". Even if I signed up as a different user, my admin account was still signed into. I also was not logged-in upon signing-up as a Realtor or House-Hunter.   Some other comments are: An Admin should be able to set the password for realtor or house-hunter. That is a security vulnerability.  When I tried to use the "Reset password link", I get an error. When creating a house as an Admin, I shouldn't have to know the ID of the company, I should be provided a drop-down of existing companies - the same way for how a realtor chooses a company to join. Asking a realtor to choose or create a company before signing up is another security vulnerability - you leak the existing companies and allow someone who isn't a user of your system to create a company. The Inquiry and Interest flow in this application is really well done.

problem Overall the write up was not bad. Here were some of the things I believe that could be improved: Problem Statement;Seems to be wrong. I believe it should be included in the background as it merely describes the files that they are supposed to work on.
problem Overall the team has done good job in maintaining Ruby Style guide. The team could add more comments and reduce code redundancy in scores() method.

problem Overall the code is written in an extremely clean and readable way. Having said that I would like to propose one suggestion which may help in future. There's 2 instances where code has been added in the index function of controllers (namely houses_controller.rb & list_of_pot_buyers_controller.rb). After the if else condition if search exists or not, the main search logic in houses_controller.rb could be added to a new function by passing the search params to that function. Similarly in list_of_pot_buyers_controller.rb, the SQL queries should be put in other functions say "def generate_list_of_potential_buyers"
problem Overall test coverage  was decreased by 35%.
problem overall only 3 commits are made during the entire project. no new code was committed during the second round

problem Organization of the document is missing. It quotes a problem statement, presents a flowchart, and states a pair of objective-solutions yet again. From this write up, I could understand that they're trying to do 3 things: log the time that each review takes (by improving an earlier project), auto-save reviews, and merge data of details page on report page. I cannot find these clearly separated.

problem Only user/realtor login has been implemented yet. Other functionality is missing. README stated that admin has not been configured. 
problem Only user model in app/models, rest of the models such as house, realtor, real estate company are missing Same with controllers.   In user model, could add validation for email format    I would suggest user gem 'devise' for user management and 'rails_admin' for admin functionality.  This helps as the gems taking control of implementation and the developers can concentrate on business logic  If back is clicks on user edit , the user is logged out instead of going to profile page

Houses data is missing in the system. Search functionality is present in the code however I was not able to locate the proper view for that.

problem On checking, the code, we find that, in agreement with @TravisBuddy, the code had a build error which seems to be unresolved, which is strange, and should have been looked into. Moreover, the overall coverage shows a good amount of increase which is good. But one must say that the details in the code changes as few as they seem have been to a good extent for the majority of the part and thus worth the merit.

But one must say that the details in the code changes have been to a good extent for the majority of the part and thus worth the merit. One thing that surely catches the eye is variable naming, especially 'handle_dups' which is a strange/ amateurish way of variable nomenclature and there is reason to believe that it may result into conflict in code at some point.

Moreover, the overall coverage shows a decrease of 0.1% which should be a cause worth looking into. But one must say that the details in the code changes have been to a good extent for the majority of the part and thus worth the merit.

problem On checking the videos, the functionality seems to be working fine. I haven't been able to manually test it.
problem On checking the pull request, it shows the Travis CI check has failed.
problem Of the functionality the team have tried to to implement, the code quality is not poor. However, the arrangement of code is difficult to understand given that not all functionalities seem to have been implemented. The "def after_sign_in_path_for" function in the applications controller used by the devise gem, only takes realtor as a resource, I would advise using an if or case condition within the function to allow other users to login. Also, I was unable to find any implementation for making sure that only the inquiries specific to a real estate company be visible to a realtor, and similarly only the inquiries posted by a house hunter themselves be visible to the house hunter on that specific house. I would again suggest using some If or case statements in the show function of the inquiries controller to establish identity of current_user.

problem Not really. First of all, as I was mentioned above, the relationship between house_hunter and query didn't handle properly. Second, a realtor should belong to a real estate company, not "has one", and the real estate company should has many realtors, and the mapping of two models does not work. The company id of realtors in realtors' list look like a set of random number, which has nothing to do with the table real estate company.

problem Not possible to test as no way of testing has been given at all. No procedure to be even followed has been mentioned in the poorly constructed Wiki page. All that is possible is to try to infer whatever is possible through the pull request in which I have reason to believe as suggested by the code tester that multiple files are failing in the build stage itself.

problem Not only does the build fail with multiple errors, the overall coverage is shows a significant decrease instead of an increase which is a real cause of concern. Moreover, the number of commits even though impressive does include a lot of minimalistic changes which one does beg to question the necessity of. But that's still fine since, I am assuming that the complexity of the code may require so many commits. But still adding a line break as a commit? I am unsure if its a great way to go about it.

problem Nope, they have errors in their build too as indicated by Travis CI and this is the error message output by it " Hey @ppvasude, Something went wrong with the build. TravisCI finished with status errored, which means the build failed because of something unrelated to the tests, such as a problem with a dependency or the build process itself." On checking the build logs I found that they errors in Bundle Install stage itself resulting from missing gems which they haven't resolved as a part of second submission.

problem Nope, the last commit still shows from 12 days ago which is the time period even before the first submission. Overall, the branch is 3 commits ahead and 20 commits behind the Expertiza master. Even so, conclusively going by their git hub their last commit was before the first submission and hence, no commits in the second submission.
problem Nope, again they did not mention a lot about how they test but what they have done .
problem None of the tests - travis ci, code climate have passed
problem None of the relationships are handled with the built in has_one has_many or belongs_to functionality, except the user model which randomly belongs_to realestate
problem None of the models specify any belongs_to or has_many relationship and no migrate nor schema stores an official reference to be used.
problem none of the functions are too long could find changes where DRY principle was violated the code follows ruby convention and guidelines Although the code is easy to follow , the team needs to add comments for the changes which is currently missing. Good Job!

problem None of the controller or model are tested.
problem No. This is not standards to add colors in the respective element. It becomes very hard to maintain or modify such changes in future. It would be better to move the style to a scss file and use a class-UI to make this change, which is clean and DRY

problem No. I do not think the code is ready to be deployed. I found the code change hard to understand, there are no comments and neither has the logic or rationale behind the new/changed code been given in the wiki. Besides, the build fails and there are a host of issues that need to be fixed.  Although all this might only be trivial issues and can be fixed rather easily, the code as of now, is not deployment-ready according to me.

problem No, the team hasn't committed any changes during the second round. The last commit was on 31st October 2018.
problem No, the team has not been diligent in specially making a section of "what it does" as the introductory section of the doc so as to make us understand the goals of the project. They have seemed to not even make a Wiki page for the same or have seemed to forget to upload it. Because, how am I supposed to follow the approach and solution of the problem if there doesn't exist any documentation to check for the same.   
problem No, the team has not been diligent in specially making a section of "what it does" as the introductory section of the doc so as to make us understand the goals of the project. They have just copy pasted the problem statement on the wiki page in a single paragraph. Even, that statement seems to have been incompletely pasted in just a single paragraph. So, it highly unclear what they are doing. I had to open the projects assignment doc of the professor to try to make sense out of the motivation of the problem.  
problem No, the team did not add any test cases and the coverage did not increase. The overall decrease was -13.6% to 34.007%
problem No, the strange part is the code hasn't been committed during the second round. It is strange because they have surely seem to have achieved all their requirements to problems going by the wiki page so, why haven't they committed the new changes is the question. 
problem No, the README file tells me what I should do to test in local computer, and does not offer admin's information or any instruction of how to operate when login to the website.

problem No, the build for the pull request does not pass. The build had 4 jobs, out of which 2 jobs passed successfully. However, 2 build jobs have errors. First job failure is related to webdriver error for chrome where test fails. Second job failure is related to NoMethodError for method []
problem No, the build did not pass. It seems that airbrake_expection_errors_feature_tests_spec.rb has some problem.
problem No, the build did not pass in Travis CI. several checks were failed but there was no conflict with the base branch.
problem No, the build did not pass in Travis CI. Several checks had failed but there was no conflict.
problem No, the authors didn't improve the code.
problem No, that doesn't seem to be the case since, it has been a very jumpy approach and also the functionality of only a basic login has been added. So, if adding the bare login and sign up is considered as an MVC architecture then they have surely built a bare backbone of it.

problem No, testing is not covered yet.
problem No, since no write up or no wiki page exists. it is clearly not possible to ascertain any of the above clauses.    
problem No, one of the functionalities of the Test Plan is not yet done.
problem No, not really. The website just has one role to operate, and the readme file is an auto-generated file, which doesn't include any useful information.
problem No, not really. No user type has all the functionality in this review's check boxes, much less all the functionality specified in the project description. Manual inspection of the test folder reveals that all the model and controller tests are empty, as are the fixtures.
problem No, not really. First of all,  I still cannot login in as admin according to the account and password offered in README file. So I cannot see what could happen when I log in as an admin. Even though a hunter can put an inquiry for a house, but the realtor are not able to reply it. However, compared to the commitment in round 1, they have made a lot of improvements, but the admin part is still falling.
problem No, not really, the design is does not implement the test plan but rather goes on to show how the pre existing Expertiza algorithm works. So it would help if they showed the same.

problem No, according to the commits record in github, I think that they seems created a new repository to replace the old one, and most of changes happened in one day, Oct 10. Besides, I cannot see the sign of team work. In Oct 6,  one guy submited the first comit, and the other guy submitted some changes in Oct 10, which doesn't look like a team work. Since they replaced the old repository with a new repo and didn't show much sign of team working, I give they one point.

problem Nicely implemented code. Used ruby delegations appropriately, and the code is very readable.  However, a few things can be improved.  for eg, in inquiriy_replies_controller, flash[] is used to transfer data from the new method to the params method, which is not the correct way. Also, I believe that the implementation can be made more efficient by reducing the number of database hits. For example, in almost all the controllers, there are redundant database hits: User.find(session[:id]).role_type == "buyer" could have been identified during login. A second hit to identify the role type or any such info can be avoided. For a small test database, this would not show any performance decrease but as the records increase the pages will become exponentially slower.   Maybe you can store these in memory [Session?], which would reduce time taken significantly at a small memory overhead.
problem Nice work implementing image upload for houses. I found some functionalities missing: - After deleting a company, an error page shows up instead of a valid page, also sometimes the company does not get deleted - Company edit link goes to home page instead of edit form - Realtor can create a house even though (s)he has no company - Interest list page for hunter loads 'page does not exist'

problem Naming looks fine. Could probably have used is_submitted? instead of is_submitted.
problem Naming is good. There are few names(eg. is_selfreview_enabled ) which don't seem fine but they were from before, any thing new that has been added by them follows proper naming convention.
problem Names could have been better designed especially the 'quesparams' variable. I get no idea about what that variable is used for or what that implements. You can rename it to question_params, or duplicate_directory_params etc.
problem N link to the deployed version is provided hence cannot comment on this question

problem Most of the updated code is well written. Some functions could have been shortened. For example, in the set_display_type function, instead of writing a 'when' statement for each of the options, you could have stored them in a hashmap and set display type to that value if it exists in the hashmap.

problem Most of the source code is following standard Ruby practices. However, some cases could be improved. There is a number of variable names that are concatenated with numbers for example user1, user2 etc. While this approach can be justified in some cases, I would suggest using more descriptive names instead or arrays if multiple instances are required. Moreover, indentation needs to be fixed to improve code readability.

problem Most of the relationships have been implemented. I couldn't log in to the admin 
problem Most of the problem statements have been addressed, just missing a test plan
problem Most of the naming is reasonable and follows standard Ruby practices.  One problem is that code makes extensive use of variable names concatenated with numbers. Example: allow(participant3).to receive(:topic).and_return(topic) Here it is not clear what distinguishes participant3 from other participants and why it is special. It would be better to avoid using contractions such as stu1 or p1 (.sort_by_name method, Line 130). Furthermore, I would suggest using consistent indentation (for example .get_authorization method, Line 113).

problem Most functionalities are working great. In the first round admin was missing some basic functionalities, now they are present and working. One issue that I came across is that while admin is creating a new company, the system keeps raising an error saying that the website url is invalid and so the users cannot create new company. Maybe, there is something wrong with the validations of Company model. However, when realtor creates the company, this error does not occur.
problem Most commits were done by one person which cannot be considered a good practice. Naming of commits is done well, names are descriptive of the introduced changes. I would suggest doing commits more often by dividing work into smaller chunks.
problem Most basic functionalities are working. Admin functions of add/delete users is now working well. One issue that I faced: realtor view house listings button not working, so most of the realtor functionalities (as they are dependent on houses) are not working.

problem Kind off. I felt that admin should have been able to delete the company irrespective of the realtors belonging to the company. I felt that that scenario should have been handled in one of the following ways:- 1. Realtor associated to the company should be deleted, obviously not preferable. 2. Realtor continues to exist but without the company and thereby no houses or inquiries assigned to him.

The input will be a text block of the review comments to the algorithm, and the output is consisting of different fields such as sentiment score, sentiment analysis as positive/negative, suggestion as present or absent. However, it is unclear to me as to what basis (the suggestion detection algorithm details/explanation/high level overview) do you classify the data into suggestion classifier.

problem Its good, can be more elaborative. Also in sections where you have added the code changes, you ca add comments to the code as well for better understanding.
problem Its deployed on heroku, but haven't written about what all features you have completed and what all features are left to complete. Also there are few pages where you can add a link to go to main menu. Sometimes I have to go back 3-4 times to reach main menu.
problem Its an UI intensive project, so no specific design approaches are applicable. But the team should have put it more details into the document to elaborate the changes and they choice of tools under the bootstrap framework. Like a pill or navtab or navbar is going to be used to achieve a particular look, and if one of them, why the choice. Such details on decisions should be included in the design document.

problem It would be more modular if realtors, house hunters and admin were a different table. Since they are clubbed under users table, there are many checks performed in most of the views. Cannot identify user names, company names as IDs are displayed. It would be helpful if this can be modified.

problem It seems you have cover 94% of the participant.rb. However, all checks have failed in the pull request test.
problem It seems you have all the needed sections(and then some!). You just need to rename them to project purpose, project design, and testing plan. For example, the section titled Testing should be renamed to Testing Plan. 
problem It seems to me that the implementation of the project has not started yet. Hence, the exact place in the Expertiza code where they plan to make changes is missing. This should be added in my opinion. Additionally, they have explained very well as to what changes need to be done and how they will be done. So, good job there.

problem It seems the authors didn't have a clear and detailed plan about how to change the current system to meet the requirement. They got the direction to do the project but still lacked details to implement it.

problem It seems that some of the associations were attempted. (1) Real Estate Company contains many users and houses and (2) House belongs to a Real Estate Company and a user. These relationships are currently commented out so the dependencies are not enforced. There are additional connections missing such as the Users model, where a Realtor should belong to only a single company and many houses. The implementation seems incomplete, but the idea found within the company and house models is moving in the right direction.
problem It seems that everything works, though it was hard/confusing to find everything as per the instructions on the write-up.

problem It seems not working properly. When logged in as a realtor, click on the view inquiry will jump to the house page.
problem It seems like almost all changes were made on one day for part 2 of the project.
problem It seems evident that there are deletion issues for any resource/user that is already indexed on some other resource/user. The solution to that issue would be  adding a destroy dependency in model files, for example for house hunters, has_many :inquiries, dependent::destroy
problem It seems as though you have an awful lot of controllers that are supposed to have something to do with authentication that either don't get used or don't have any code in them. Other than that, the project looks organized like a Ruby on Rails project should be. There is a lot of code that is hard to follow, and I can't discern its purpose in several controllers.

problem It is very well written with a nice flow diagram. The second video link on the wiki page is unavailable, which can be fixed/removed in case it is legacy.
problem It is very difficult to recommend merging this code. Although it builds and appears to function correctly, it is not properly documented. It is difficult to tell how the code works and whether test cases introduced actually function as they intend.

problem It is surely a very intuitive user interface because the ease of navigation is generally very well defined and the routes.rb file in git hub makes the session linkage explicit.  Even, so one does fail to understand the empty blanks on their login page since there aren't any blanks at all. So, we get easily confused on what to do. Sign up is not validated for any functionality be it user or admin or realtor and we don't know what to do.  Luckily, the README File does resolve the dilemma and help us to follow the steps. 
problem It is pending while I am doing this review. When I click on it, it did not pass Travis CI, but it fails on tests on features, while this group is testing participant, it happened to our group as well, I assume it is not an issue with their code.

problem It is not explained why the work was done, the way it is done. But the implementation looks promising
problem It is not a very intuitive user interface because the ease of navigation not achieved in it due to the ill defined 'db' folders and the routes.rb file in git hub makes the session linkage a bit hard to follow.  Also, I fail to understand the structural flow of the program even after logging in after signing up. So, I get easily confused on what to do. Sign up is not validated for any functionality be it user or admin or realtor and we don't know what to do and that are we admins or any other user. Privilege separation has not been done. Also, the README barely resolve the dilemma and is of minimal help to us to follow the steps.

problem It is given in wiki that most of your test cases depend on checking the output. However, like I mentioned in my last review, several test cases like the ones mentioned below can be automated. This is especially true as TDD is explicitly mentioned in your problem statement: "Write the required tests before implementing/refactoring the methods in the above-mentioned classes". Add past due assignments to the students task list (on Student View). Check for correction in due dates of assignments (when an assignments due date is edited, it should be appropriately moved from the Past assignments list to the Current Assignments list if needed) On Student Task page, separate the list of 'teamed with' students from the current tasks box.

problem It is a testing project which aims at improving test coverage. So production deployment is not in question. However before merging the code to Master branch here are a few recommended changes. 1) Adding comments to improve readability and understanding for future use. 2) Avoid using comments like "I swear this is the last one". They do not explain anything about what you changed from your last commit and why. Proper professional comments are expected. All these comments should be refactored.
problem It included a proper test plan. There was no test plan included in the previous version of the design document but authors have added it in the second round which made the design document complete.
problem It has not been thoroughly tested. user,house and company models don't have enough validations, like valid year, phone no should be only numbers.Creating a company while creating a user doesn't link that company to the user. it has to be done manually later

problem Issues with the build Can be fixed quickly. Issues seem trivial.
problem Issues related to not mentioning the functionality of each method have been resolved. The wiki now mentions what each method does and what issue does it fix. Only issue with the current codebase is that it contains very long functions that could have been refactored and broken down. The 'perform' function contains a lot of lines and has tons of if-else statements.

problem Issues - Able to create admin accounts. View Inquiry is failing for HouseHunter. No way to see interested house list.
problem issue 1065 uml diagram is too high level so it does not provide enough details, Rest all diagrams follow the standards and are easy to understand.
problem Issue #1201 In the assignments_controller code, the team has checked in a puts statement (line 48) which looks like debug code. Even though these are helpful during the development phase, we need to remove them before finally pushing them. Issue #391 The comment (assignments_controller.rb:85) is not descriptive enough. The author has commented out a method call. It would be beneficial to the person reading the code to understand the intention behind this. Please provide a detailed comment on why this was done. Again the author has use a puts statement (_submitted_files.html.erb:29) which should not be committed and should only be used during development/debugging. Please remove the debug code.
problem Issue #1201 Below is the change made in _general.html.erb Directory name will be autogenerated if not provided. In the form of assignment name_id_course_id. The last part could be modified to something with a bit more clarity. From the assignments_controller code it could be seen that the auto-generated directory name follows the format <assignment name>_<assignment id>_<course_id> which is not what is specified in the text. There is a typo in the word 'autogenerated', it needs to be hyphenated as 'auto-generated'.

problem In the first round, the application was slightly performing better as compared to the final one. The team may have had troubles while merging and unresolved conflicts lead to error pages for signups.
problem In the first round the team had only created the two Web IDL  files namely OffScreenCanvas.webidl and OffScreenCanvasRenderingContext2D.webidl; which are the interface files which define the implementation in the corresponding files offscreencanvas.rs and offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs. In this round the team has implemented the functionalities described in the two Web IDL files in offscreencanvas.rs and offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs. The offscreencanvas.rs interacts with the javascript and hence has the constructor with attributes height and width; a method getContext() to return the reference to OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2d; and a reflector object for garbage collection. The offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs file does not interact directly with Javascript and does not have a constructor or reflector object. It has the code to build the offscreencanvas object.  On inspection, the variable and method names used in the code are intuitive. But the main issue is that the name of the webidl file OffScreenCanvasRenderingContext2D.webidl and corresponding Rust file offscreenrenderingcontext2d.rs don't match. The team could have formatted the code appropriately for readable indentation. There are not many comments that give a high level description of the code. Instead there are some instances of unnecessary code that has been commented. The code is indeed DRY.
problem In the due_date_color(due_date), instead of hardcoding the color vs interval, it would have been more useful if those are pulled from a config file. That will make the implementation more flexible   Similar hardcoding found in 1. list_student_tasks: per_page: 10 2. breaking_word_wrap: breaking_word_wrap(student_task.assignment.name,40 )     Use of inline CSS element, could have avoided by using a simple css class. Such harcoded stuffs make the view strongly coupled with the style elements, which could have been avoided. <hr style="height:2px;border:none;color:#e3e3e3;background-color:#e3e3e3;"   Also, the UI changes are not showing up properly aligned. Please see the attached screenshot

problem In general, the problem seems to be easy. but design states that  it involves whole new MVC setup which could translate to difficult implementation
problem In general, The code of this system is in a clean and readable, and written in the MVC way. But there are some problems in the code. For example, in the realtor controller, there is no method to handle the "join" action when a realtor wants to join in a new company. And a realtor can not receive a inquires from hunter. Besides, in the models folder, I seems redundant to me: role, users, and users_roles, making reader easily confused.
problem In general, the code of this system is clean and readable, but there are some problems in it. For example, author didn't handle the interest list properly. When a realtor wants to see the potential buyers of a house, it does not mean he wants to see all the hunters registered in the system. Besides, the realtor can not edit his own profile can change real estate company, because the edit method in the controller is not realized. And in models, some relationships shouldn't appear because one of the model is not created, such as the model house_hunters, which has many queries, but the model query is not created.

problem In general the code seemed to look fine. There were some really long methods like in the users_controller class, so I docked a star. There was a separate method for adding to interest list.
problem In due_date_color switch case would have been a better approach then if else if block. Lots of code that is done in view can be moved to the controller. Follow MVC architecture.

problem In documentation it mentions participant.rb model file is changed to for increasing code coverage. However the file is missing in the pull request generated. There is no mention about changes in the assignment_participant.rb file. But that is present in the pull request. It may be a name mismatch or some files are indeed missing. I pointed it out during the first review but changes are not incorporated currently. The code overall looks good. Proper variable names are used. Commenting is required

problem If company is delete, the house will also disappear, and the realtor need to find a new company. But the README does not cover edge cases.
problem If as a realtor, I am trying to update my profile where I only change my company to a random company "ABC", it is updating just fine which I believe should not be done because the company doesn't exist and is not even being added to the company list as a new company. Couldn't check any of the admin's functionality. Couldn't sign-up as a Realtor.
problem If admin tries to delete company, corresponding houses gets deleted. Similarly association between inquiry and other models handled well. System goes into error when we try to create house without images, though houses gets created multiple times. (Realtors login) Team could probability add null check for empty references.  
problem if a company is deleted the realtor and houses doesn't get deleted. and if a house gets deleted the inquires are not getting deleted.

problem I would only suggest you to add more comments to your code. I know that no comments were previously added for you to feed off of, but I guess a major aspect of these OSS projects is to add as many comments as possible to the existing code.
problem I would have liked to see more use of context in the tests and grouping of similar test methods in context.

problem I was unable to judge if this works -there was no way for me to determine that. The admin can not delete companies, can not view, edit or delete realtors or househunters. Also, users cannot delete themselves.  Further, the third party admin gem or module  used does not let me edit or delete users or companies either - it gives an error on heroku.  Thus, I was unable to determine if the edge cases work. Also README does not specify anything.

problem I was able to post house without any data filled in form. House got created successfully. Likewise for company. Phone number validation missing in Sign Up. Sort by Sqft, Price and floors are failing (going to error page) Applying price range filter and clicking once is giving expected result. Clicking on it again is resetting the filter. Could try to retain the applied filter on the html select option. When I tried to view a non-existent house manually by changing URL (example https://calm-forest-11598.herokuapp.com/house_lists/1000), I got the default Ruby error screen ("The page you were looking for doesn't exist").  Could do a redirect to browse page :) (https://calm-forest-11598.herokuapp.com/house_lists/)   Tried to update an old inquiry. got a new page that says "Invalid Access" as well as "Inquiry was successfully updated"!

problem I think we cannot add it to production because i feel authorization for the newly added pages is required.  once that is done it should be okay to add the code after further testing  
problem I think User experience and code readability are as imp as producing a working code. So based on how urgent is the requirement for this functionality, I would prioritize refactoring the Notices and Display messages to more appropriately indicate what action was taken when we try to add a participant to the assignment or import using a CSV file. Secondly improving the comments as explained with an example in the first question.
problem I think this team did not correctly implement several database relationships. For instance, a House does not have many users, it has a single realtor (the realtor who posted it) and it might have many interested users (potential buyers), but that should have been via a through relationship. Another example is inquiries. An inquiry has one user for one house, not many users and many houses.

problem I think the files that the authors plan to modify seems to be quite appropriate. As to the 'smell' of the code that can be ascertained only when they have started writing the code. So far though the design seems sound. There have however been no mention of the existence of any gems. I think the authors should explore that avenue as well as that would probably simplify their task. For example:- I found the gem sentimental that categorizes the phrases into positive, negative and neutral. I think this is something the authors can look into.

problem I think the code need some amount of refactoring before it can be merged with the expertiza master and pushed to production. Some of the functions implemented by the team seem quite long and they should try and restrict the functionality implemented in each function to just one.

problem I think that there is a huge scope for test plan improvisation. The current test plan is just a step-by-step procedure to test if the reviewer receives a mail fir conflicting reviews. The test plan should also include test cases to test whether the link is present in the email notification. Also, is the link correct and navigable? The test plan should also cover the pits where the functionality may fail, so as to ensure smooth functioning of the system.

problem I think that the team has done a great work for the future team to pick up. They can improve it by adding comments for newly defined functions. Although, the pull request build has not passed, after fixing the conflicts, the new team can readily work ahead on the remaining issues.
problem I think that the authors have identified changes in the html.erb files, which looks right to me. As it only deals with the sorted view of instructor reports, the changes must go in the views part of the application.  Suggestion: You can try to add a bit of information on whether your changes include addition of new code, deletion of existing code, or just slightly modifying or extending the existing code and justify it. Query: Do you plan on creating  a drop-down like option to choose from which type of sorting is to be performed? If yes, it is an add-on user-friendly feature.

problem I think it does pretty well to follow the "good Ruby and Rails coding practices". It is elegant and follows the DRY code approach.
problem I suggest the testing plan be improved. In place of giving steps on how a reviewer should test the project, the team should instead list how they wish to write tests for the functionality added. The rspec could be something like expect(page).to have_content(sorted)

problem I saw a lot of places were instance variables were used when the didn't need to be (ie using @var instead of just var in methods). I think naming seemed appropriate were I looked. This team made good use of helper functions and classes, though there were some rather large functions in those classes. I saw a lot of complicated views, which to indicates lack of separation of concerns.  I would recommend being more diligent about the scope of variables and continue trying to push concerns/responsibilities to isolated classes and methods.

problem I really appreciate the organization of your code. Everything is grouped in appropriate folders and easy to navigate. I also like how most of your code is indexed and spaced. Great readability. Functions are clearly written to handle exactly what the name indicates. There are a few places where the continuation of parameters should be realigned (examples: company_params in Companies Controller and format of website in Company model). Overall great use of Ruby styling standards.

problem I liked that instead of stating all the problems at once and then stating their solutions the design doc tackles in one at a time. Still there wsa no visual aid provided for the project.
problem I just see commits done on last few days by most teammates.
problem I have not been supplied with a link to manually use an instance with their changes and I have not been able to find a link in their PR or write-up.

problem I have no idea how to test the code manually.
problem I have been unable to test the users work manually as expertiza does not allow me to send a mail to my existing mail id. I have also tried adding a new student to the assignment which was not possible( i got an error stating the student does not exist) and all existing students have the mail id( expertiza@mailinator.com) which cannot be accessed to verify.

problem I had suggested changing the ambiguous or bad variable like temp, temp1. These changes have been incorporated. However comments missing. Adding these will improve the readability of the code and make it easy to refactor at a later stage as per requirements
problem I found the write up to be same. There is more scope to improve it with more explanation and test cases, specially the links to the refactored codes could be added for the other teams to know.

problem I find few changing records from github, but I can't show the process of development.
problem I felt there was just too much overlap and with the doc from previous year: 2017 Project . Even if the current project is to extend a previous one, the documents aren't supposed to be copied almost word to word. The only major addition I see is the last section. None of the diagram correlate to the new changes being made; they are contextual to the older project. Testing plan is missing from the document. From what I know, even the development projects need that section. Even when the older document was used, no references have been provided for it.

problem i felt there was a need of adding more explanation. Add UML diagram so that it is easily understood
problem I felt the section "conditions tested in menu" could have been more verbose.
problem I feel you guys should add a few comments for a third person to follow.
problem I feel there are more number of test cases that need to be covered before deploying this in PROD.
problem I feel the user model is well tested. The link to houses broke through realtor role on heroku. This might just be a production issue and might work well locally in the development environment. I recommend checking the heroku logs and fixing this error. Due to this error, I could not create any house for listing. Overall, I feel it is a good job and you have managed to implement most of the functionalities. One suggestion would be : 1)      When I try to sign-up as a user, I have to fill up the role type. This is not intuitive for a user as the user does not know what kinds of roles and their format(case sensitivity, data type etc) expected by your system. I would suggest either give a drop down for this or checkboxes which will be easy for a user to use.

problem I feel that the writeup was incomplete and none of the code changes made have been explained. It is difficult to see what approach they took.
problem I feel that the test section is in adequate, the users have only listed 3 scenarios with no details on how to implement that. Also missing are detailed steps on how to execute the tests if required.

problem I feel that the code from line 64 to 76 could have been written in a separate function to avoid making the function submit_hyperlink from becoming so large.  Additionally, the functionality inside the function review_reminder_email could have been separated into 2 different functions.

problem I don't think the test has been finished. the controller test file is basic empty and the same empty in the model test file.
problem I don't think the authors plan to add methods to the wrong class. They are modifying the right files. The new design does not appear to potentially make the code "smelly". But for few issues you haven't added any files which you'll be modifying, only the uml is given, you can add them before the final submission.
problem I don't think the authors plan to add methods to a wrong class. They seem to be working on the right class namely Review and its associated view page review.html.erb that exactly pertains to their project. The response time might potentially increase with this new feature. But fortunately the team has proposed to work on optimizing the suggestion algorithm so that it does not take forever to execute. The team has done a good job on the design documentation.
problem I don't think anything is missing from their document, but it is in general "lite". I would prefer a few more details on how they plan to limit reviews from being viewed until a self-review is complete, or which places they plan on making changes.

problem I don not think it's good, because they just paste most of their code on the writeup.
problem I do not think the code should be deployed. The test cases are not yet written and there are a few code climate issues. Due to the lack of test cases, the Travis CI build has also failed.  Suggestion: Once they are resolved the code can be deployed. There is one remaining issue, but that could be done in the next iteration. 
problem I do not think that the design will increase the response time of the system. The team also has mentioned about the API that they will use. Enough efforts have been taken to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it.  Suggestions: No information about the methods that will be implemented has been given in the design document. Availability of such info would have been helpful.

problem I couldn't log in using the admin credentials. Rest worked fine for me. Couldn't add houses in my interest list as a House Hunter.

problem I could only check househunter UI. Since I could not find admin and realtor code on github either, I believe you are yet to implement the functionality.  The UI I viewed was easy to use.

problem I could not check if most of the edge cases work. All the ways I tried doing this failed: Admin cannot destroy most of the users, admin cannot view/edit/destroy realtors, admin was unable to destroy househunter account I created ( it was also registered as a realtor acc ),  When i destroyed the company, associated houses were also destroyed, and their associated inquiries and replies were deleted so that edge case has been taken care of.   I believe that maybe all the cases are taken care of, but I could nopt test them as their dependent functionalities are not working.

problem I cannot appraise this because I do not believe they did their development in the linked repo. There is only one commit, where all the functionality was added. I am inclined to say the team was not actively developing over the project period.
problem I cannot access the link provided by the team. Since this is hosted on AWS, I believe they have not opened the Ip to public by mistake (I have worked with AWS before and this happens). Maybe they worked from Library or their house, and when you spawn an instance in AWS it adds the IP from where the instance is spawned to the access list, which is why I am not able to access this from my IP. This can also be a problem with the proxy server setup in the instance and since you guys are maybe doing ssh into the server to deploy your code, the default HTTP request will go to port 80 and wont be forwarded to 8080 unless explicitly specified in apache/nginx and will block the requests. Easier way would be to host the app on heroku which handles all this automatically and provides you with a DNS entry
problem I can't say about this since I tried to login with the credentials mentioned in their wiki(student5408/password) and I couldn't. However looking at their screenshots it seems that the UI looks good to go.

problem I can't create a house with no basement as a realtor. It also deleted my image after I uploaded it in this case, before it redirected me to the new page with error information. Also, potential buyers are listed twice (I'm assuming because they liked the house and submitted an inquiry to the realtor associated with it.).

problem I can see that there are multiple commits on a single day. This might imply that team members have worked remotely without using git. Suggestions: 1. Make complete use of git when working remotely. 2. Keep pushing changes periodically to avoid any code loss and to have a timeline of changes. 3. Commit message carries great importance for the first level of code change analysis. So this has to explain the changes to a decent extent. Commit messages in this repository is vague; if they are meaningful, it reduces some effort in analysing the code timeline.

problem I believe this change that affects the system as a whole, needs more test to be performed in all affected tables and functions to be sure, no other part of the system is broken.My opinion is that, once all parts of the system test is done, corresponding to this centralized db change the code can be deployed to production.
problem I believe the wiki is not complete. However, the content that is included so far does aid in the explanation of the project purpose. More elaboration and completion of additional sections such as the testing design and implementation of tests will help to fully clarify the project purpose to the reader.

problem I believe that code, as it stands, is not ready to be deployed. More comments are needed and the code is hard to understand, so even though the changes are small, one might need to see id the changes can be simplified. I believe testing can be more thorough too. 
problem I believe more effort should be expended on the design. Currently, it is still not so comprehensive. A lot of details can be added in terms of how each file should be modified and how the sorting will be implemented.

problem I am unable to go back to dashboard. Hence I am unable to test the functionalities of House Hunter.   The back button is a major problem.
problem I am unable to find the file review_response_map_spec in the github repo that was supplied. However, there was a ruby file that was attached in the submission. The variable names are also clear and unambiguous. This file is incomplete but the tests that are complete seem to follow appropriate syntax and guidelines. I would suggest to add some describe and context blocks that would clarify the purpose of each test case rather than just have the it statement saying the name of the method being tested. Keep working to finish up the remaining tests in this fashion and it would be great.

problem I am not sure since these are Unit tests and there are Travis tests failures too. Need to check with the team and mentors. 
problem I am not sure how to create a house hunter and realtor using the same email. I see a link to switch roles, but can only see realtor option there as it didn't allow me to create an account for house hunter with same details.
problem I am not convinced with the "similar_assignments" table schema. For an assignment Ax, there is a foreign key that points to an assignment Ay such that Ax can be an assignment in say 2018 and Ay can be the same assignment in 2017. But what if one of the reviews from assignment Az which was in 2015 was really good and we need to include that as a sample and also include another review from Aw from 2016 as a sample.  According my understanding, this above requirement cannot be met with the current DB table design. Something that the team may look into.

problem From what I see it looks like code we have seen in class. Although in the model classes, they don't have any associations between models.
problem From what I can gather, nothing sounds too complicated individually, but the practice of a workflow across multiple pages can become very cumbersome and complex. I don't see any details on how this team plans to mitigate those issues.

problem From the previous stage, the team has added the Use Case Diagram that efficiently describes the actors involved in the process. Also, since a new controller is proposed it was essential to identify the role of the instructor.
problem From the file diff in GitHub, it looks the code is in good shape. There were a few suggestions provided during round 1 review. If those could also be integrated, it would be better. The test cases are successfully running. But the functionality could not be tested due to lack for steps in the wiki.

problem From the Code DB Design looks fine. They have handled most of the relationships properly. Although I believe having different tables for admins/realtors/hunters/users/roles and role maps is un-necessary and just increases the complexity of the system. 
problem From my previous review of this project, there have been few additions to the set of functionalities implemented. For the 3rd project (OSS) the team had worked on OffscreenCanvas.rs (interacts with javascript) and OffscreenCanvasContextRendering2D.rs (works on OffScreenCanvas) which are implementations of OffscreenCanvas.webidl and  OffscreenCanvasContextRendering2D.webidl  (Web IDL files) respectively. In this project, the team has proposed to implement OffscreenCanvas analogous to HTMLCanvasContextRendering2D, by reusing some code from the latter and add additional functionalities. They finally propose to implement blob API, to test the contents on the canvas and also support webgl contexts as used in WebGLRenderingContext.

problem For the first two issues, the team gave different conditions but no codes or demos are presented in the wiki for this test, I can only know the results by the description. For the later issues, the team gave the comparison between the old version and new version, which is easy to understand.
problem For the "manage participant" part, the authors didn't explain how will they solve the issue that the "add student" button cannot work correctly after a user add a course. The document included other changes need to be made, but the explantation was not clear enough. The design used a lot of components in Bootstrap, but the authors didn't give any explantations to these components they would use and didn't give any diagrams to show what the changes will be like.
problem For sign up, I don't understand what is the difference between "I am shopping for a house" and "I am a realtor and I am shopping for a house". 
problem for now explainations are in preliminary state , I'm hoping that team will fillout this as they progress in project

problem For each problem the authors display relevant chunks of code and discuss which parts need to be changed. Aside from the Issue #1072 all the solutions seem reasonable and simple. One minor suggestion for improvement would be to use the .collect instead of the .each method for computing total_weight in validate_assignment_questionnaires_weights method.
problem For each method, there should be multiple test cases, but they put all tests for a method together wrap by a single it '.....' do, they should consider to add more it '......' do, to separate each test case, so the reader know what are they testing.

problem Fixed problems: Users can edit their name now. Admin/Realtors can create, select(only one) and change companies. They can edit their own company's information. Admin/Realtors can view/list houses and edit/destroy houses that belongs to his/her company. Realtors can switch roles to house hunter. House hunters can view/add companies info. Inquiries functionality is implemented. Issues: Houses do not show if they have basement or not. After an inquiry is sent, the app redirects to an error page. Looks like house hunters can add company/houses too. These tasks should have been restricted.

problem Features implemented in this project work as intended. After running the code manually I am getting the same coverage as stated on the wiki page. One problem is that the main object under test - participant is created using build method. factories.rb describes participant as an instance of AssignmentParticipant class. There is a possibility that this is complicating test cases or will complicate them in the future. The solution is to either define a new Participant class instance in the factory or to define it in the code itself.

problem Except for the test plan, the design doc seems to have all the important details. The team should add a test plan before starting in order to go for a test-driven development. 
problem Except for the lack of comments, the code was relatively easy to understand, and was sufficiently DRY. 
problem Excellent writeup. The instructions were clear. The screenshots were apt. One suggestion: Could be shorter and precise.

problem Excellent work but the codeclimate build has failed
problem Excellent use of visualizations!
problem Excellent code! Very well commented and followed most of the Ruby,s standard code formate. Very well organized. 
problem Everything works from their UI. Their peer review plan works as intended and clearly explains how to test on UI. There are SQL errors when trying to delete a user which is tied to some assignment. Although the team has mentioned it is out of scope of the project, future work could be to remove those SQL error displayed on pages and give a pop up / alert box, saying your user is tied to an assignment.
problem Everything works as per the video linked in google drive. A link to the same can be added on the wiki page.  
problem Everything seems good. You can move constants to a separate file and use them . For example where you are comparing =="admin" or =="realtor". You can either move them to a separate file or in database and use it.

problem Even though there is a no test plan available in the write-up, however, a lot of tests have been added. 
problem Even though the code has been refactored keeping in mind the coding standards but I think that there is still room for improvement in writing the test cases and the PR checks should be checked as well since they are failing. This is something that the next team could pickup and then the code could be ready to be deployed on the production server.
problem Even though the build is failing in Travis CI, there are no conflicts. The controller tests are failing as there is no flash message that is appearing. Please look into this.
problem Even though few test cases have been provided I feel like it could have been more detailed with the steps involved in the testing.
problem error w/o company for realtor on viewing buyers empty companies- validation missing for empty info on companies admin view - realtor show not working admin view - hunter show not working Search by area missing- no fields to search by area

problem Don't see the role switch functionality and it's not mentioned in the readme file too. While adding a new house by an admin, it is seen that I can add it to a company, say, A and and also add a realtor, R1, which does not belong in company A, but another company, say, B. So what is the flow here? The end result is the house has a company A, but has a realtor whose company is B.

problem Document explains the problem well. One thing I would like to explained more is how strategy pattern being used will help reduce the code than the amount of code currently present, But i guess that will be explained better once the teams gets to implementing stuff and knows a bit more about the design.

problem Difficult to test and review the work one since there were no screenshots provided. I was not able to find an instance of a review which could be submitted as a team but not by individual members of the team. Some of the webpages crash after clicking on a particular assignment to view the review report. Suggestions: The team could explain steps to access the "review view", so that manual testing could be done. The team could create dummy assignments for testing. Maybe, adding screenshots would help in the process.

problem Commented-out code should be removed (at least one example found in participant_spec.rb). Also, there are some indentation issues as well as other issues flagged by CodeClimate. Otherwise, the code seems to comply with the Ruby Style Guide and be fairly DRY.

problem Code quality was not upto the mark. Firstly, there were 3 separate table for admins, realtors and househunter, which caused a lot of redundancy inside the application, as well as for the user using the product. Secondly, the lack of proper documentation made it very difficult to traverse through the code.

problem Code mostly follows good styling guidelines but there are a couple of issues. I would suggest splitting nouns when naming classes (e.g. PotentialBuyer instead of Potentialbuyer). Spacing is inconsistent in some classes (househunter_controller.rb#search and houses_controller.rb#show). There are some cases when decomposition and moving functionality into a separate method would make sense. For example in search method of househunter_controller.rb class, if statements could be moved to a separate method with a descriptive name. This would make code more readable. There are instances where code is commented out (e.g. inquirydetails_controller.rb). Removing that commented chunk entirely would make code cleaner. Deleted chunk could always be referenced in git history.

problem Code looks okay, but I found few features missing. As far as code is concerned found admin details hard coded in the code, this is a wrong way to do.   Could have used tables for better alignment    
problem Code looks okay, and the spec is written in detail. But as mentioned earlier, I'm not in a position to judge due to lack of video or deployment link or even some screenshots proving the work.

problem Code is written well without dead or complicated code. DRY principle is followed. I can not see any changes or commits in code after last submission.
problem Code is written properly. Simple and clean Every function is simple and has distinguishing work. Did not understand the need of creating MVC for search, photos separately.  Many functionalities could have been merged together and made a defined solution. Eg house search function could have been added in House MVC.

problem Code is well written. Functions are well defined. Some areas where it can be improved is moving the house search logic from controllers to the respective models. 
problem Code is very neat and readable. I appreciate you attention to following good syntax practices. There is some similar code was exists in the controller action method and the content page method but simple to bring out and make dry. Overall great job.

problem Code is running and no errors are encountered. However, very few tests have been written and coverage is low. A way to make the testing more robust is to test every function with a known success case and  an edge case or potential failure.

problem Code is great, usage of SearchController and PotentialBuyerController shows deep understanding of rails as a framework. Great job. But I find following missing  1. In controllers, you will need to put before_action :authenticate_user! 2. Usage of devise for user management is good.  3. Code for Models seems to be missing, House has no entries , validations , relations etc 4. You can use rails_admin for admin account management 5. Gemfile has ref to sqlite impliescode is not deployed on heroku atleast 6. Integrations tests have been written which is good.

problem Code is clean and variable names are readable. Need a bit of formatting as some lines are not 'aligned' well. 
problem Code is clean and easy to understand. Some unused/unimplemented empty function definitions are there in the files.
problem Code in the model methods looks very clean. Attribute symbols are appropriately validated and proper constraints are applied to measure uniqueness. The controller code has great parenthesis and bracket use for function calls and assignments. More consistent spacing of functions and function content would aid in the readability of the code. Also, there are a few instances where conditional blocks are empty. If there is no purpose for the block, it should be removed (example found in the static page controller). Overall, the code seems to implement good Ruby style standards.  
problem Code has been submitted frequently.
problem Code had a few guideline misses which was noted and suggested by the automated tool on pull request.

problem Code follows standards but variable names can be better and more 'readable'. Another suggestion: declare ALL variables first then use those variables to call methods. When you add/declare variables in between method calls, it looks as though you 'forgot' to declare earlier and added them later. Just a thought !
problem Code does follow the conventions. Just that the comments could be better explained for the functionallity
problem Code convention for mail looks good but I found find_participant_emails misleading because it gets email for all participants and not emails for participant
problem Code climate show 99 issues in the code. Many lines aren't properly aligned. Commented code hasn't been removed.

problem Code changes does not follow the DRY principle in atleast two places. Also, the comments in the code are not helpful. All code comments are like "# E1834 Fall 18" which does not explain what is the code does, it only says when the code was added. Such comments may be removed.
problem Code appears to work. Don't really know what edge cases there could be due to lack of a test plan.

problem Class diagrams are missing. Class diagrams are missing. First flow diagram looks perfect.

You should add a step to perform a check to see if the total students count is crossing the allowed limit(10). If yes, then don't add this new student and show some proper error message to the user. If no, then add the student.

problem Changes to application continued throughout the second round of project submissions. Many of the commits deal with the adding additional functionality to the company controller, as well as, additions to the ReadMe. I can see that good work was made toward implementing missing functionality from the first round of submission.
problem Changes proposed by authors are good. But, they are explained in detail.
problem Changes proposed are adequate, but without any reference to code or design diagrams its hard to tell if the proposed solution will work. It is always better to investigate the code instead of writing states such as this "Maybe the legacy code is in two places hence the two calls"

problem Both the project purpose and the project design are not very well stated.  In terms of project purpose, although I was expecting it to appear in the introduction part, it actually did not. The part just stated a high-level abstract goal, being transmitting the conflicting message to the grader. But it's not at all stated in detail. So I went to the proposed solution to find the project purpose. In the proposed solution section, Neither project purpose nor project design was well put. It talks about changes that are expected to be implemented in the file. But they are not talked about in detail. This sentence: "loop through each review not for calculating the average but to compare the new review score with each review score"    seems to be not so easy to be understood. The project design seems also to be in the proposed solution section. There's no detailed modification plan, workflow statement, or anything.  The testing plan looks succinct and helpful enough for a tester to use and check the functionality.

problem before deploying the project onto the production server, this projects asks  for some attention. new test cases should be added to the project. I can't say much on that.

problem Because they did not provide a link for me to test, i am not sure if their code has bugs, so i don't know if this code is ready to be deployed onto server.
problem Because of the merge conflict in gemlock file, it is not merged and travis CI has not run.  i believe they ran bundle update and committed the file which should not happen as it updates the dependencies and might break some features.
problem basically, it is good. however, i cannot find the test paln, and some explanation is not complete.

problem Authors describe the strategy they utilized for tackling the project and the detailed mechanics of each test case. However, there is no mention of specific design decisions or patterns that were used in the implementation. My suggestion is for the team to elaborate on technical decisions made for simplifying test cases for example the majority of mock objects is created at the beginning before every 'it' statement.

problem At several places, the code used a lot of nested if else statements and some methods were very long. These lines could have been refactored. Also more comments are needed that explain what a method/variable does (just good naming is not enough). The code is DRY compliant and follows style pattern well.
problem As this rubric calls for the need of a section - Test Plan, I suggest adding it and including the work done in that section along with why a particular test has been written.

problem As this project is in the early stages of development, the UI is minimal. The title is prominently displayed as a header on the home page and subsequent pages to clearly indicate what this application is "Real Estate manager". The login and signup links are clear as to purpose; however, the intent in the presence of the words "Hello World" beside them is unclear. Additionally, the login and signup page functionalities are easily interpreted. I would suggest that the user profile actually display what kind of user they are rather than a number that only has meaning to the system, as well as, a log out link/button in the header for a user as he/she traversed your application. The README file only contains the fact that there is no pre-configured administrator. I would recommend including the suggested context from the Ruby generator and the project write up.
problem As they have provided a very high-level idea of their proposed solution, there is no pseudocode or any class diagram which helps explain the design adequately. You can improvise the design by including flow of the methods, to highlight how and where will your new method come into picture. However, looking at the intended modifications, it seems that the changes follow DRY principles, and changes are not unnecessary. There is also no need of using any design patterns as per the required changes.

problem As stated above, the writeup has a missing test plan which could be added by the team for the second iteration of the submission.
problem As stated above, the team has not explained any design pattern they are following. However they have mentioned all the code changes they are making for this functionality implementation. The code snippets they have included is very useful to understand the exact code changes they are making and the files which are getting impacted. This would help the future developers to understand the  code in a simple manner.

problem As mentioned in my previous review, I cannot understand the back-end design handling. Which controller and view files are being modified? or Will new methods or .erb files be added? Any plans to use third-party gems or API's?
problem As mentioned earlier, they have not considered testing at all at this point and hence, we are assuming that they are to implement testing at a further point in the project. Of course, mentioning an approach to the testing framework and how they would be going about it would have helped. Moreover, the absence of a wiki doc only adds to the grievances of being unable to decipher the problem statements.

problem As its a test project, deployment to production may not be applicable. The code can be merged, but i would suggest few changes to DRY the code as the test seems slow, which is a scope for improvement.
problem As It did not pass the test, it is not ready. For a future team, end of this project should be a good starting place.
problem As I said early the images are very very large and don't fit unless I have the wiki full screen. Also finding the changes from the original is a bit tricky. 
problem As given in wiki for their test plan,  The admin tests include building and deleting both Administrator and Instructor accounts using Capybara for testing the front-end web functionality. it 'delete instructor successfully' do it 'delete admin successfully' do To test the role creation, Capybara was again used to check that the web page did not have any button for "New Role" and that navigating to the page manually resulted in an error. it 'should not create a new role and redirect to index page when "new" method is called' do.   Although they havent explained the edge cases and negative inputs in the wiki, their test cases cover whatever has been discussed
problem As for the designs proposed by the authors it proves to be substantial since there is a good amount of Design aspect in their doc.  Sure, they have defined an application flow, but that is all there is to it.  1.

problem An unnecessary commit has been performed because  of which build has failed, and i think it wasn't required as already code had 100% coverage. You should check that out, it just an indentation issue i think. Format it using rubymine and push, it should work.  A shorter video to explain the work has been added as well.

problem An old test case fails. Looks like it was broken before and therefore not a result of your changes
problem An exception occurred when replying to an inquiry. An inquiry could not be deleted by a house hunter.
problem Although what changes are to be made is explained, how they are going to be made isn't explained. However, there is no Ruby code involved just CSS styling so applying appropriate principles and patterns does not really apply in this case.   
problem Although there aren't too many commits, The team does seem to have been updating their git in a continuous manner. 
problem Although their documentation shows screenshots and their app is deployed on VCL, there was no testing plan/ how to test on application. There was no screencast too. So it poses a difficulty on how to see. But from the screenshots on the documentation, the features seem to work good.

problem Although the write-up explains the things clearly, visual aids will leverage your proposed changes. Suggestions: You can include UML diagrams like use cases, application flow to elaborate more on your additional changes. You can mock the changes ( editing html page to show proposed changes) which will really help in a better understanding of your design.

problem Although the test plan looks good, I am not able to see any test cases added in the pull request.
problem Although the test coverage is increased according to github, i could not find any new test cases in the project. The team has not added any test case for the correction.
problem Although the relationships have been properly handled, I see in places with a belongs_to relationship optional:true option is present which allows violation of the relationship and is a bad idea.
problem Although the design provided is clear, there might be some more work needed to optimize it properly and make it work as intended. 
problem Although the application is deployed on Heroku and the user interface is concise and easy to use, the README file provides no information about admin account(email and password) and application features.

problem Although not all sections of the document are complete, upon completion, these sections will be more than adequate in successfully describing the project, its design, purpose, and intent. Nice work.
problem Although no specific test plans have been mentioned, the wiki page does show screenshots of the changes that are visible after logging in.
problem Although it looks like a good start the team can still improve on the design by adding a UML diagram and a test plan. There is a need for a low-level design explanation so that others can understand the technical details of the implementation.

problem Although I believe this project is ready to be merged into the branch, I would still like to make sure as to why their build is failing in Travis CI. Most likely it's not because of their own code, but as a suggestion the team should have also looked into this matter themselves, and explicitly stated somewhere in the wiki by getting clarification from the instructors.

problem Although branching strategy was followed. The commits mostly seem to be made on the second-last and last day of submission. It will be helpful to keep committing code at the end of each day or every couple of days so that there is no major issue of merging at the end. Also it ensures that all team members are working on the same copy of code.

problem Although as per the scope of the project, the team did extremely well. All implementations as written in the project description were completed. However I feel that this project in general has more scope. Say introducing email notifications to the students when a review is due. As far as the work of the team is concerned, they completed everything that was asked of them.
problem Although as per functionality, this code is ready to be merged and the team did put in a fair amount of work into it. Still, I believe this project can be bettered by another team in the future by refactoring some the code to improve code writing principles and also improve the wiki documentation.
problem Already covered in detail in above question. There are some issues with View and Create Houses functionality. Also Deletion of users is working fine but gives error when clicked on Realtors or House Hunter's Account Button in Admin View.

problem Along with the above improvements some of the things you might want to take care of are: Even if a company is deleted the houses and inquires remain as it is. (Partial reason is the above bug which allows to create a house and post reply without being associated to any company).When I try to delete a house it shows application error. So not able to test if dependent child records for potential buyers and house hunters are deleted or not. For Realtor and HouseHunter Signup, it should be allowed to signup without specifying company or other details except name, email, password as per the usecase given. This is not allowed currently.
problem Almost all variable and method names are well-defined. Suggestion: Try to refactor method 'render_report' in module ReportFormatterHelper by using hash instead of really long case when statements.
problem Almost all variable and method names are well-defined. Suggestion: Try to refactor method 'render_report' in module ReportFormatterHelper by using hash instead of really long case when statements.
problem Almost 80-85% of the features are covered. Dual role implementation is missing/not working. Signup doesn't give an option to register as both realtor and hunter at the same time. Input validations are not handled. Remove from interest list option is missing(ideally, once the user clicks on add to interest list button, the button should be changed to remove from interest list). Admin didn't have the delete option for all the users listed (this needs to be fixed). A realtor was not given an option to edit the details of the house he/she has listed(only photo adding feature was there).
problem All users have their own model controllers. The code is following Ruby on Rails standards but there are some debug "puts" that should be removed.
problem All the variables are defined with respect to the functionality like - max_team_size, get_participants_without_team.
problem All the tests have not been implemented. but the test plan has been described. Could have included more test cases to extensively test the system. Automated test could have been written.
problem all the tests are working properly except one. A pretty good work has been done.

The only issue is related to the CI built which is failing at the moment. The team needs to analyse the root cause related to the build failure and fix it. Other than that it was a great team effort!

problem All the names are reasonable except for a few like the function name "get_feedback_assessments_for". It is ambiguous as to what the function will be doing.
problem All the names are intuitive and reasonable apart from "drop_topic_deadline1". The team need to change this variable name to something more precise other than that Good job following naming conventions!

problem All the buttons which do what they say they do are quite good. Quite reasonably, I can click on these buttons and the expected behavior occurs. It's a little weird to have to select whether I want to log in as a house hunter, a realtor, or the admin at the login screen, and that it doesn't work without selecting the right user type.   Unfortunately, many buttons do not do what they say, or redirect the application to a dead page. Here are the functionalities which do not work: 1. Attempting to delete Real Estate Company makes you view Real Estate Company detailed info. Inquiries do the same. 2. Attempting to 'show' anything that's not a real estate company throws a 406. 3. As a realtor, I tried to Update/add company information and my change was rejected. 4. The List a House form has 'create company' as its submit button.    There are also many things I expected to be able to do that there were not buttons or links for.
problem all the basic scenarios are working fine. No issues or problems were found with the functionality. There is an issue related to the CI built which is failing at the moment. The team needs to analyse the root cause related to the build failure and fix it. Also the scenario where the TA is assigned to a instructor , what will happen to the instructors impersonated students when the TA of the constructor login to the application. The scenario could not be tested as the same is missing from video and the application is not deployed. Other than that it was a great team effort
problem All the 1-n, n-n Relationships have been commented out. There are no mapping table in Schema as well.

I have looked into the seeds.rb file and got the admin details from there. Do make changes in the Readme file.

problem Actually,, the design seems not simple. Due to the ambiguous of the design, I cannot tell clearly what the four links are used to do in the first step, but it seems too many links will be used and some strange conditions need to be checked before instructors can perform a review. In addition, it seems not all the instructors can do the reviews, so there may be some errors? Description for step 2 is also complex and seems include a lot of jobs need to do.

problem Actually, all these edge cased list above are not realized at all.  And the mapping relationships between the models don't work at all. For example, when I delete a real estate company, and I look back to realtors' list, nothing happened, because the company id in the realtors' list looks like some random number, such as a company id 6, which is not appear in the company list. And so does the house list.

problem A small suggestion , new_feedback --> author_new_feedback The variables, methods and class names are aptly named. I could not find names which are not suggestive of functionality.
problem A simple enough explanation has been provided for how the functionality will be working.  Suggestion: I feel that the approach that the team will take to implement the functionality should have been explained more elaborately. For example what different possible methods will be implemented. Or how the web service will be used, or what kind of data the web service will provide for suggestion detection.

problem A model has been thoroughly tested.
problem a Lot of refactoring is required before the code goes on to production server.
problem A lot of outdated approaches were used. Refactoring was needed.
problem A lot of commits were done in phase 2. A total of 106 commits were performed which is quite impressive. It shows that the team was working in a timely manner, so well done there.  However, I deducted 1 star as I could see 2 commits done after the deadline on Oct 13.

problem A huge improvement from Round 1. In round one not much code was submitted so this is a huge improvement. Keep it up. I have a Suggestion: It is very important to have comments in the code which will help other readers understand your code or in this case understand what you have tested without having to look for any other documentation which explains it. (Code file should be self sufficient)
problem A flowchart and graph has been shown in the documentation.  Suggestions: I feel that there should have been mockups of the screens where the functionality will actually appear. Team should have shown how the solution would look like on the expertiza page. There could have been use case diagrams too. 
problem A flow chart is depicted in the documentation. However, other UML diagrams could have been represented to show the structure and the sequence of the project. The flow chart depicted is a little high level. The total capacity of the project could have been represented by more UML diagrams.
problem A fix for the second and fourth issues is missing at the current moment. If this is included as in the other issues then the document will adequately propose solutions. Also, perhaps more elaboration on the 3rd fix on how the columns are not being copied over (I know the code is pasted but a simple worded explanation would be nice too).
problem A few tests were added, though I'd like to see more tests regarding edge cases or invalid functionality. 
problem A few comments could be included in code to make it more clear.
problem A few changes to functions and their declaration have to be made to make the code production ready
problem A detailed explanation would have been better
problem A commit has been performed 4 days back , which isn't making any change to the code just the indentation, and since then build hasn't passed. You should check that out, it just an indentation issue i think. Format it using rubymine and push, it should work.

problem 1)In the first release there was a issue in user registration. The issue still persists. Team has kept both realtor and house hunter registration on the same page that only allows house hunter to register. 2)Can not register new realtor using registration link. For simpler design, team could have simply give 2 links for 2 types of user registration. 3)Team tried covering many functionalities as compared to last release and succeeded partially. 4)Team has provided admin credentials and admin functionalities are working fine.

problem 1)Admin is able to delete the company which has houses and realtor associated with it. When you try to edit houses associated with such company, the add button does not perform any action. where in if you try to edit houses, houses get edited successfully. It seems like relation between model and tables is not maintained properly. 2) While creating new houses realtor is asked to enter id of company and realtor.   These id's are back end data with system incremented numbers and not given to user after       registration. Hence we should restrain displaying such back end information to users.  3) Not able to submit inquiry. Posting an inquiry and reply to the inquiry is on same page, visible to house hunter. 4)  With this release team has written README file very well and neatly. Also provided admin credentials.      Below are few major functionalities team can work upon:      a)House hunter can create new company.      b)Can not register as realtor.      c)Search functionality not working.      d)Potential buyer functionality not implemented properly. It does not connect houses with potentials           buyer. It seem like listing all the buyers.

problem 1) When the admin deletes a real estate company all the realtors associated with them are deleted along with all the houses posted by those realtors. 2) Currently the Realtor is able to edit/delete houses of other companies which is the fault in the behavior and the team needs to correct this to test this edge case. 3) If Admin deletes a house_hunter all their queries are automatically deleted.Also they are deleted from potential buyers list. 4) i)If a Relator replies to the query, the house hunter is unable to see them in the system. ii) Validation on phone numbers should be enforced. iii) Session handling could be improved, few left over data are present on screen after logging out and using direct links to access page. such as hunter query after logging out. No documentation on READ.me regarding edge cases.

So they will not be able to edit,add or remove the houses listed in previous company. 3) If the house hunter is deleted by the admin, all the inquiries by the house hunter will be deleted and their names in the potential buyers list is removed. The README.me did not cover how the system handles all these edge cases. README.md could be updated.

problem 1) If a house hunter is interested in a house, there should be only one entry specifying this interest in the database. In this app, the same house hunter can show multiple interests on the same house. This results to duplicates in db and must be handled. 2) After creating an inquiry, clicking on the Back link on the page should re-direct to /houses or which ever page was visited before creating an inquiry. This is not happening. 3) Founded year field of the company table takes any numeric value --- Founded: 465789 4) The house hunter is able to create a company which is not supposed to be an allowed operation. This happens when as a house hunter, I edit profile and choose to be realtor, I get an option to create a company but even without changing the role to realtor.  5) Point 3 holds good for built year field of house table Builtyear: 7598 6) View inquiries feature is not working...throws an error.

problem 1. When admin tries to delete real estate company that has realtors and house hunters in it, there is an error that says 'Cannot delete record because of dependent realtors'. Since real estate company is a foreign key in the realtor table, the system does not allow the deletion of real estate companies that have realtors under it. 2. When a realtor changes his real estate company, the houses that are listed by him are unaffected. The system also allows the realtor to delete houses listed in the previous company. 3. I was unable to view inquiries after logging in as admin, hence I am not able to inspect the condition of submitted inquiries after the hunter who created the inquiries has been deleted.

problem 1. Switch role option is working for Admin too which is not supposed to be the case.
problem 1. Switch role functionality could have been simplified. While logging there are two fields regarding roles. If a user forgets to mark yes for realtor, then switch role will be redundant. There is dependency between switch role and these fields. Both do the same functionality which results in code duplication. 2. A realtor should not be able to add inquiry, he should be able to reply to inquiry.

problem (2) Realtor cannot add a house so could not be tested. (3) Admin is unable to delete a house hunter who has submitted inquiries but no proper explanation or error message is displayed. System handles house deletion properly. All relevant inquiries are deleted.
problem (1)No login or sing uo (2)No authorization for the user, basically, any one can do anything in this system. (3)No picture function (4)No search function (5)No reply for the inquiry.
problem (1): Works perfectly fine (2): The realtor is able to remove previous houses! works like charm (3): Enquiries are not auto-deleted
problem (1): when an admin deletes a company which has existing realtors, it shows on the admin page that the company is deleted, but when the realtor signs in, it still shows that he belongs to the deleted company, and is able to update all the profile information of the company. So, it means the company is not being deleted, even when it says so on the admin page. (2): the realtor isn't able to view any houses except his own company. (3): No, the inquiries are not auto deleted, nor is the househunter removed from potential buyers list.
problem (1): Unable to login as admin! (2): Realtor can delete houses, but houses don't seem to map to a real estate company, rather they are mapped to the realtor only (3): Unable to login as admin
problem (1): Admin can delete real-estate companies with realtors attached to it (2): Realtor is being able to delete any house (3): Admin can delete house-hunter with several enquires.
problem (1) What will happen if the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses? It deletes it successfully.     (2) What will happen if a realtor changes his/her real estate company? Will (s)he be prohibited to remove the houses (s)he listed in the previous company? No, houses are easily changed and can be deleted by realtors.    (3) What will happen if admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries? Will the inquiries be automatically deleted? If this house hunter is a potential buyer of a house, will (s)he be removed from the corresponding potential buyers list?  It cannot be removed if inquiries are pending.    4) You can come up with more edge-cases. If the system fails in some edge-cases, explain with enough details Most of the functionalities I checked, such as creating a house, putting inquiries, removing various users, looking back in different accounts if it removes such as inquiries if user has still submitted or pending inquiries. All works fine. 
problem (1) What will happen if the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses? Houses got deleted and realtor got assigned with some other random company.   (2) What will happen if a realtor changes his/her real estate company? Will (s)he be prohibited to remove the houses (s)he listed in the previous company? House also got changed to realtor's new company.   (3) What will happen if the admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries? Will the inquiries be automatically deleted?  Cascade delete is in place.
problem (1) What will happen if the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses? Can't be tested. (2) What will happen if a realtor changes his/her real estate company? Will (s)he be prohibited to remove the houses (s)he listed in the previous company? No realtor is still allowed to delete houses. (3) What will happen if admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries? Will the inquiries be automatically deleted? If this house hunter is a potential buyer of a house, will (s)he be removed from the corresponding potential buyers list? Cannot be tested (4)  Delete a house in a House Hunter's interest list and see if it still appears there? Works as expected
problem (1) https://nameless-everglades-55236.herokuapp.com/users/sign_up does not let you enter Roles  which then fails the user signup (2) No details of admin given    (3) Tried logging for companies and got an error, https://nameless-everglades-55236.herokuapp.com/companies With some combinations, was able to login but then again when tried updating account got  "error 1 error prohibited this user from being saved:", I suspect that is because role field does not have a value  (4) List of users being showed for creating a new house  (5) Issues in sending messages tried sending a message got error "https://nameless-everglades-55236.herokuapp.com/messages"

problem (1) Admin not implemented (2) Real estate company functionality missing. (3) Admin not implemented The Readme.md wasn't updated to reflect the state of the application. As best I can tell the app doesn't handle any known edge case.
problem "Switch to student view" - But to which student? Open and Close student view is handled on clicking it to switch the type of view. Same changes (to delete session[:student_view]) need to be done on logout in auth_controller as well.I logged in as instructor6, clicked on "Open Student View" and logged out. When I login again as instructor4, I must still see "Open Student View", but I see "Close Student View" while I'm not in the student view at all since I just logged in...

problem - The write-up does mention the files changed but misses out on adding code snippets. - Little formatting inconsistencies found like "-- Expertiza Project" in the introduction, and a ":-" only for Overview but none of the other headings. - Looks like "Separate the list of 'teamed with' students from the current tasks box" needs to be a heading rather than plain text! - Now we have created a separate table for assignments" sounds ambiguous - does it mean a new database table or a html table..? Please be specific. - "A helper function was also added to format a string into multiple lines" - please mention what the string is about (what it represents), what are these multiple lines that it is getting split into, and why you would want to split them. - Test Cases are not stated. Test Plan does mention one as "for example" but the testing process could've been given a little more respect. :)

problem  Your background and detail of description is excellent. However without a strong background in the topic I could not figure out what a DOM was.  I don't see anything about a test plan but other wise the detail was good.
problem  you can not destroy any real estate company, realtor, or househunter as admin with any realtor, house, or inquire, it will just throw an error. you can have negative floors for house. readme file does not tell anything about edge cases. 
problem  Yes, they have improved the UML diagram from last round and its a standard class UML diagram. Its very self-explanatory. Though the diagram under test plan should be clearer. Also, there could have been a sample report generated for reference.

problem  Yes the design is simple in nature and easy to understand. This can be attributed to the fact that their issues are quite simple in nature. They could have provided some simple UI mockups of the changes.
problem  Yes the design includes a test plan in the end. This too is very abstract (about 5 lines total) and just states the use cases. Tip: use the 'it should' format or at least describe the simple manual testing that can be done.

problem  They wrote the literal least possible, but again, I get it. Learning how to test with doubles, mocks, stubs, and spies, to peek in on the innards of a high complexity OO system was actually really difficult.

problem  They have included the flowchart of the flow of the functionality that is being added which seems to be designed properly and readable. Also database table whichthey are going to change is depicted. They could add Class Responsibility Collaborators cards to further illustrate the code changes they are about to make.

problem  They did not do any automated tests.
problem  They continued to update their project. However, some changes were made after the due date.

problem  There are no visual aids of any kind
problem  there are no deployed version of the project, readme file does not give any help, and I tried to download it, and run it locally, it is not working. 
problem  There are no any submission for round 1.
problem  The writeup overall is good, but they did change the problem related to test plan like I mentioned last time. 
problem  The writeup explains to a limited extent the approach that was followed.Majority of the writeup consists of code and not how it was implemented.

problem  The write-up has detailed how the author has done the changes. But it fails to address why the particular direction was taken, in some cases. It would be good to elucidate on that as well. In ' Solutions Implemented...' section, it would be good to include the names of the files before each code snippet and not just the description so that it is easier for the reader to relate.  
problem  The system now has the basic functionality that was missing last time like logging in. Good job on the fixes. It crashed when as a realtor I attempted to create a house, telling me to check the logs for more information if I was the owner. Still no information on an admin user listed in the github readme though.

problem  The photos included are superb at showing the expected View. They can have more 1 or 2 more stars if most of the Expteriza work for the github metrics was already completed when they made these screen shots. Do you think it is feasible to expect that you can start a software project before getting a green light on the project in order to include high quality pictures of your proposed View in action?

problem  The functions seem to be implemented in a good manner and the code seems to be DRY.. In some cases though the authors could have improved as in the i app/helpers/student_task_helper.rb  file. In side the due_date_color method they could have used case expressions in Ruby instead of the if else logic implemented as that would be a more Ruby on Rails way of doing it. As it will reduce the lines of code as well as being a more elegant way of handling it.

problem  The functionalities that the authors plan to add seem logical as they plan to implement OffScreenCanvas as an efficient alternative to HTMLCanvas but with all the functionalities included.  The authors have not discussed about the implementation of the proposed design yet, which I am expecting them to do in the next review. The response time is expected to decrease with the incorporation of OffScreenCanvas because the rendering of the images in the canvas is done independently using web workers  
problem  The Fixes Required part has been explained well with the cause of the issues. But, more light could be shed on what the formative and summative rubrics are. 
problem  The features work. However the notice messages could be improved to state exactly the action that is conducted. Eg. One of the notice message says either user is already added or it doesn't exist. Narrowing it down will be of great value.
problem  The explanations seem to be okay. Couldn't fully understand what they meant by 'use proper polymorphism to handle ...' in the problem statement part 2(b)i.

problem  The design seems to be sound. There are a lot of mention of which files will be modified however, as I said in the previous round, there is no mention of the layout of the existing database or if the changes they will make currently will change the database. Suggestion: Team could mention what tables are present in the database of the Bacui project. I believe this will be really helpful since most of the reviewers are working on Expertiza projects and have no knowledge of Bacui projects. At the very least the team could mention which tables the project will be interacting with along with their structure.

problem  Not handled (1) - No actual link created between companies and users as user just stores the company name as a string. Instead, saving the company_id for the user will create a relation between them as the company_id will act as a foreign key. That way edge case example (1) can be handled. Not handled (2) -  Realtor can edit/delete any house that (s)he created even if company changes. Handled. When a user is deleted, (s)he is automatically deleted from potential buyer list of house. The README.md does not cover how the system handles edge cases.

problem  If delete a company, the realtor needs to find another company, and the house under this company disappeared. But the README.md does not cover the edge cases. 
problem  I think with proper testing, this code is ready to be deployed onto the production server.
problem  I don't know much about the topic and so it can be hard for me to judge but I would have liked a couple more pictures or other aids to understanding
problem  I believe this code is ready to be merged once the Travis CI passed.
problem  Here the team has only included screenshot relating to how the UI of the system should look like which gives a idea of its appearance , However , They haven't given any UML diagrams to represent the flow of their work for example a flow chart relating to how their functionalities would co-ordinate.

problem  For testing I don't think there are any design related thing.
problem  Design appears to be sound, however, it is unclear where the NLP algorithm is supposed to go. As in, will the 1st iteration use another service to analyze with the button, and then a 2nd iteration will add the local NLP algorithm?

problem  codes looks clean, but there are no deployed version of the project. 
problem  can not test functionalities.
problem  As the project is based upon making changes to the UI of the system , thus there is no such specific pattern being followed however the design that they have made available in the form of screenshots appear very much inclined with the functionalities that they need to implement .
problem  All the names and methods look reasonable but some of the function size is still long.
problem  All the major functionalities work and most of them work. However, There are a couple of bugs that could be solved: After submitting a inquiry and clicking "back", the user is redirected to the page where all the messages in the database are shown The realtor is not able to view the potential buyers for any house The look and all the major functionalities are running smoothly. Great work on that!  
problem  Again, its fine. I don't understand the changes too well, but I also don't understand MVC and Expertiza very well either, but maybe they could have tried harder. I do feel there is a strong need to refactor and improve the code quality of Expertiza.
problem  Admin should not able to submit an inquiry and put a house in interest list. Also, the user should not able to sign up as an admin. And reply to the inquiry function must use the email system to reply, cannot do it onsite. When creating a company, the user can only choose Raleigh and Cary as their address. Cannot see the house list by other company. 
problem  Admin - As an admin, when creating a user, there is an option to create an admin - Can't add a house, gives me an error ( im not adding a picture when i save) - can't make inquiries - can't add houses to interest lists - new hunter/realtors i made did get added to the table of all user Realtor - when i switch companies, the previous houses listed from that company, don't appear again. Hunter - search doesn't work - can't make inquiries or add houses for interest list -
problem  A more through explanation of what each testcase does will be useful. Its documented well about what the testcase will return but not what it does. Mentioning that will be useful

problem  (1)Functions are still long, save choice and save quizes are the top two, consider increasing more internal methods
problem  (1) I don't have access to an admin account to test this (2) There were no currently existing houses and I cannot create a new one (3) I don't have access to an admin account to test this (4) The README is still just the default one provided by rails.

problem   Yes they have a test section. The amount of coverage added for the new tests is great. Keep it up, however I would have liked that the authors added more negative cases as part of t heir unit tests.  I see mostly the +ve test cases being handled in the tests.

problem   The test plan has covered test cases for testing functionalities of sorting submissions table and review mappings per field. They can also include test plan for the edge cases of the system, like the code should not break when the submissions table is empty and show should probably display a flash message saying "no entries to be sorted!". In this way, try to add a few negative testing to improve your coverage. This will make your code more rigid.

problem   The design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the use case diagram in which the users are student and instructor and the data base is where the actions are stored in the database and the retrieved from the same for the case of reviews information.  Also, they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the Application Flow section so as to elucidate the problem statement. 
problem   The authors have done a good job by identifying the sub-classes they plan to add. It would be good to have an overview of the class definitions. It is quite clear from the explanation that they plan to have different tasks depending upon the type of report to be removed.

problem   Realtor can't sign up without specifying a real estate company. This shouldn't be the case. Realtor can't edit his profile after logging in. Admin not able to create realtors and house hunters. Nothing happens when the submit button is clicked. Later this was found out to be because of the phone number not having 10 digits. But no error or validation message was shown.  Admin can't create new houses. Realtor after logging in can only create and view houses. No way found to view and reply to inquiries. Also, no way found to see potential buyers. House hunters can edit houses due to session issues.   House Search feature breaks. It works only with location. Realtors are not able to add new houses. Admin can't delete a real estate company. Clicking destroy takes it back to the show page. Log out running into errors.

problem   I could not see any test plan. Team could work on writing test plan and implementing the same for the issues resolved. Also where team is failing to implement some functionality, as future scope, they can try design the solution and also test cases for the same,
problem   Convert if nested inside else to elsif. Unused variable key inside remove_non_utf8 method.   
problem   1) It seems that something is wrong with admin login functionality, as I am not able to sign-in as an admin with the provided credentials, thus I am unable to test this edge case  2) Due to missing functionality of realtor being associated to a company, I am unable to test this edge case. 3)  It seems that something is wrong with admin login functionality, as I am not able to sign-in as a user 4) There is no potential buyer's list, hence cannot test this edge case.
problem  Yes, the team has covered the high-level implementation changes to be made to the system. We get the gist of the files that might be changed and what is end goal to be achieved. Though, its not very clear what is the change to be made under Separation of concerns section, which could have been explained better.

problem  Yes, the code was extremely clean and readable. The naming represented the task( such as: remove_from_interest_list, show_potential_buyers etc ) of the method and no extra load was carried by that method, except for the action assigned to the method.  No methods were longer than necessary and no unnecessary nesting was present. Though not major, a suggestion for the team is to avoid using pronouns or subjective references such as my_interest_list and houses_posted_by_me for method naming. Also, as methods are referred to as actions, naming should reflect an action, so add show in front of naming such as houses_posted_by_company

problem  There is no problem statement mentioned in the design document. It directly dives into the implementation details. This does not help the reader is understanding the need for a project. There is no test plan, project purpose. The team has tried to provide a design implementation details which is not very descriptive. More effort is needed to enable reader to understand the design better           
problem  The team has partially handled the relationships. Has_many: They have aptly provided all the has_many relationships, such as RealEstateCompany has many houses, relators; A House Hunter has many interest and inquiry etc. One more relation should have been a relator has many houses under him. Most of these relations are bi-directional associations, so there should ideally have been a belongs_to relation. Such as, if a Company has many realtors, then a relator belongs_company is an association. No such relations are found in code. Also, as the realtor can only be linked to one company at a time, this calls for a has_one relation. 
problem  The team has efficiently described the problem statement and the need for undertaking such a project. Good effort. As it talks about refactoring, few more lines on the pain points of current design would have helped a great deal in appreciating the project. The design selection is great. Apt to the problem and the UML diagram to visualize it, is helpful. The UML diagram should have been more descriptive on how the current code is to be modified to incorporate the proposed design pattern, as it was not easily to know, if this pattern would fit the current code. Test plan is missing.

problem  I dont see a test available for controller or model in the code, and as its not documented whether a different type of test implementation is available, I am marking this unavailable.

problem  All basic functionality outlined by the test suite is working as expected with few corner case bugs. The filter functionality should have been more flexible to filter for a range of price and Sq ft, rather than try to match exact numbers provided which is not user friendly. Also the realtor signup should allow realtor to choose company from list available which is more user-friendly 
problem  1)     The diagram provided is a generalization for strategy pattern and more aligned to help give a simpler outlook 2)     The standards are not followed, as it should indicate the class type (as an interface) and the method implementations needed in the concrete classes 3)     The UML is high-level indication. More project specific diagram is needed
