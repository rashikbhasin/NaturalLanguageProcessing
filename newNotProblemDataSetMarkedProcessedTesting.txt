noproblem a concrete test plan is also added and it has both ui and automated test details
noproblem yes this is done very well
noproblem they include a very described test plan it has everything proper what framework what tests all this information is well included they clearly specify what they aim to test
noproblem the test plan is pretty good and it has both ui tests and automated tests   
noproblem manual test plans as of now the team is planning to add rspecs after implementation
noproblem the test plan is designed efficiently they have described the ui tests and automated tests which cover most of the cases   
noproblem two types of testing are listed and the authors list all the cases they need to test
noproblem the author has excellently explained about the changes that they would be making by providing the design diagram and the screenshot of the the changes that they have incorporated also they have mentioned about their choice of tool which is google chart and why do they prefer so overall a good explanation
noproblem changes that s needs to be made has been explained correctly
noproblem yes their doc has adequately explained the changes
noproblem the team have a well written design document and and the authors have explained the proposed changes well the authors have also listed each file they are going to be changed
noproblem yes the team has well explained the changes that they are going to make last time it was a bit confusing but this time because of   the help of the diagrams and mock ui screen the solution seems clear now
noproblem the authors have explained the changes made to the system the design flow greatly helps to understand the flow of the system
noproblem the authors have described what all changes they plan to do and where they plan to do it compared to the previous version of the design document they have now included what tools and framework they plan to work on the design document looks complete and understandable now
noproblem they will be changing mostly html and erb code to create a visual interface that delivers information to instructors more effectively
noproblem the proposed changes have been explained in a simple manner
noproblem the document adequately describes the project description and proposals made the proposed change of generating a single or single bar chart graph based on the categories selected to display the chart can be efficiently made to the system
noproblem they have improved the document to provide a better description of changes to be made to the system
noproblem yes the design is sound and gives a proper explanation about how their implementation would behave
noproblem design seems correct
noproblem yes their design is clear and sound and the principles and patterns are well used
noproblem yeah their design seems to be sound and neat
noproblem system is well defined  
noproblem the design document is good and i don t think any design pattern needs to be followed as very few changes are being made   
noproblem the design makes use of the google charts tool to generate visual charts for specific criteria set based on the design flow it appears that the functionality can be consistently performed to generate the visual graph for the instructor
noproblem yes the design appears to be sound and uses appropriate design principles
noproblem yes the design is pretty simple and inclusion of screenshot enhances the clarity of what the team has achieved in terms of the required changes   
noproblem design is simple and easy to understand
noproblem yes the design is simple and easy to understand i can easily know what they will do through their doc
noproblem the design appears to be very simple and well written they have explained the use case diagram very well also they have added visualizations
noproblem yes the design is simple and easy to understand  
noproblem the team is using external tools to do the work and its clear and easy
noproblem using google charts is a good idea
noproblem from the reasons provided for choosing the google charts tool and it s effectiveness it can be integrated into the system functionality easily making the design simpler to be executed
noproblem yes design involves google charts api   and seems very simple
noproblem yes the design flow and the screenshots very clearly describes the changes made to the system
noproblem flow diagram explains the flow correctly
noproblem yes they have used visualization to help people understand their design
noproblem the bar charts have been added to the design report the visualizations have been added to views also and the screen shots have been added too the only thing that i would like to add is that the bar charts could have been more descriptive as in they could have added details for   x label and y label and also put legend this will aid the user in quickly understanding what the chart is conveying   
noproblem they have worked on their weak   point earlier their solution does not seem cogent but i would say now they have made good progress
noproblem the sample data visualizations is good the way they have given visualizations for sample data is nice easier to understand and good
noproblem the document does include a flowchart which shows the flow of changes however an uml diagram would have made the document more understandable and easy to follow
noproblem the team already has mockups for their design
noproblem the visualization is great the screenshots clearly indicate the proposed output of the project
noproblem the team has not included any additional diagrams apart from the flow diagram provided in the first stage the flow diagram effectively describes the sequence of actions that need to be taken so that the instructor can view the bar graph visual representation for the selected criteria set
noproblem really good visualization provided
noproblem according to the team the specification of the project does not require us to use automated tests    but they plan to test the modified ruby code or the new features using   the   rspec   testing framework overall the test   plan sounds good  
noproblem no tests are required for the project as stated
noproblem this team did not require any tests
noproblem the design document does not include a test plan as testing requirement   is very minimal since most changes are in view
noproblem the test plan section specifies that it does not require performing any automated tests however since the new functionality of adding a visual diagram the team would modified ruby code for the functions added to the grades_controller
noproblem authors have explained the changes that needs to be made clearly
noproblem yes the design is sound and appeopriate however it may be better to implement more code level design
noproblem simple and clear easy to understand
noproblem it gives a high level design picture and two scratches of ui which are all good and understandable
noproblem the test plan is completed just one suggestion that it can be more specific for example it may include some real test cases
noproblem yes have included the flow of the process in the second round of interview
noproblem 1 the document clearly mentions the changes to be made to the existing system and requirements that need to be delivered 2 also mentions the changes to be made to the ui 3 the files to be added modified are also mentioned
noproblem 1 follows appropriate design principles and patterns
noproblem 1 yes the design appears to be simple
noproblem 1 document includes test plan 2 however can include more test cases

noproblem ui mockups and uml diagrams are descriptive however more information should be conveyed to how to solve the problem
noproblem yes diagrams are self explanatory
noproblem the design appears to be sound following all the appropriate principles and patterns i liked the overall flow of the document
noproblem the design looks to be simple and clear to me it clearly states what files are going to be changed and as per my knowledge there is no redundant and unnecessary change
noproblem i liked the visualizations used this time around they have certainly improved from the last time i liked the overall used of high and low level visualisations provided
noproblem even though few test cases have been provided i feel like it could have been more detailed with the steps   involved in the testing
noproblem yes very clearly writeup
noproblem well they have mentioned what needs to be done what changes have to be implemented

noproblem yes   
noproblem yes the authors have specified the changes to be made in the system under the proposed project design the changes have been included as sub heading with sub points under each the authors have also included a relevant files heading that includes the files where changes are made the changes involve allowing the instructor to change language for a course in the process a separate language column will be added to the courses table and a dropdown of languages in the edit courses page where a language can be chosen once the instructor updates the edit course page with the chosen language the static strings in the expertiza application will be changed to the chosen language for adding multi language support google translate and rails internationalization api is being used also two yaml files en yml and hi_en yml contains the translated strings for the respective languages the routes rb file and all the view files will be correspondingly modified to show the different languages after reading from the yaml files   
noproblem the explanations provided by the authors seems to be good they have referred the rails internationalization api guide which provides sufficient explanation for multi language support they have mentioned the different elements that will be changed and how an instructor would proceed to change the language of the course verbally in addition they have also added mock ups to visually represent this information
noproblem the explainations are succinct the description in technical design section and before after images clearly shows what the project intends to do
noproblem the changes are clearly mentioned they are very clear what and where to make changes only suggestion would be to include more about how these changes are going to be done   
noproblem adding a languages column to the courses table makes sense and so does leveraging third party apis to handle the translation
noproblem the design is as required following the appropriate patterns
noproblem as far as the issues are concerned the solutions do seem logical
noproblem it is sound
noproblem looking at the design there seems to be high use of cohesion   and low coupling it s good that all the changes are restricted to the routes rb and config locales files so that the resulting changes won t be messy and ruin the rest of the system also this helps in refactoring if needed in the future as there will be limited number of files to be changed
noproblem yes the design appears to be as simple as possible the team has mentioned what needs to be done and how they plan to implement it
noproblem yes simple straightforward solution   
noproblem the changes have been explained well enough to minimize the complexity the implementation seems extremely clear
noproblem simple and easy to understand steps
noproblem the team has mentioned properly what changes they are doing and how they will be doing them in the first submission they had suggested the possible approaches now they are having a concrete way they are implementing these changes
noproblem yes and at times much more than necessary   
noproblem yes only view files are involving since this topic is about changing the language
noproblem yes the authors have made changes to the design document and are more specific about how exactly they plan to implement the new functionality
noproblem yes they explained a lot for the changes great job
noproblem the design appears to be very simple the team has avoided unnecessary complications by adhereing to the rails internationalization guide they have also avoided making unnecessary changes to many files and kept the changes to the minimum number of files required
noproblem the team added more information from the last time which aided in a better explanation of the problem good job team
noproblem 1 the authors have adequately explained the changes to be made to the design document
noproblem the design is really crisp and easy to understand one can clearly understand the problem statement and the proposed solution for the same the design document is properly structured as well
noproblem the explanations are more than sufficient not only have the authors explained the changes to the system but also explained the reasoning for considering those changes i like the way that they also explained the other different ways they could ve integrated the github metrics but avoided those methods with sufficient reasoning for the same the team has also given an explanation of their database design modifications would be like which is good
noproblem yes the current design looks simple and wholesome seems they have done a good job in implementing understanding how rails internationalization works good job     
noproblem yes excellent work done by the team the design document adequately explains what is the problem that they are trying to solve what is the proposed solution and how the solution would look like    there are enough details to in the document to understand what is being done and what changes are proposed the document also has enough illustrations on what is the current situation   
noproblem the authors adequately explained   the changes   they plan to make
noproblem the design seems to be sound they have a sample design where they are explaining the tables and how they plan to work with them as well the examples provided help understand how the data will be stored
noproblem yes
noproblem the visualization clearly and effectively conveys the translation capability which the project proposes to provide to expertiza
noproblem yes the provided diagrams deliver sufficient information about the implementation
noproblem yes
noproblem yes they included some design principles which is good maybe the authors could add some design patterns into wiki
noproblem    the design appears to be sound they have weighed their options and are using an official gem to interact with the github api
noproblem the necessary visual inputs to aid explanation are present
noproblem mock uis screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required changes
noproblem i don t   see any issue in the design document they have followed a good design principle
noproblem no visualization or diagrams are necessary
noproblem 1 the authors have mentioned several approaches in which these functionalities could be implemented 2 their chosen approach is follows mvc architecture and dry principles
noproblem    the design sound very reasonable
noproblem the design is concise and clear they have added reference images of how the system would look after their changes which properly shows the expected implementation results
noproblem yes it is thoroughly investigated
noproblem yes
noproblem their design is much simple and clear also easy to understand
noproblem yeah i believe it is as simple as possible while choosing the best path for the expertiza project to grow but it still sounds like a very ambitious project for 1 group to complete
noproblem with proper documentation the problem is explained nicely and understanding of the complex problem is made easier
noproblem 1 have clearly mentioned when will github api be hit to retrive the data and which gem will be used
noproblem    their design is simple and clear
noproblem the use case diagram properly shows how the addition of this feature will help for   the instructor role
noproblem the visualizations used by the team are comprehensive and well made
noproblem good design
noproblem a testplan that covers the entire functionality has been devised it seems sufficient to test the change
noproblem excellent use of screenshots made things very clear for me
noproblem the test plan is compatible with the problem statement   
noproblem yes they use a lot of diagrams to show use case
noproblem as there are ui changes test plan is not required but a basic stepwise description of how to see the required output can be helpful
noproblem test plan have been shown clearly and tests are easy to understand
noproblem yup because it only tests the ability to change the language
noproblem explains the different approaches with the help of use case diagram
noproblem there are enough aids such as uml diagrams and screen shots the authors explicitly mention that there are no db changes so no need of an er diagram although i would have liked some class level details to be mentioned in the document that would help to dig more about the design changes
noproblem    they not only use use case diagram but also mock up screenshot to help the reader understand their design
noproblem the test plan briefly mentions the scenarios the team plans to test they can add more about the test cases if possible
noproblem the test plan seems adequate at this stage edge cases may need to be considered at a later stage
noproblem no
noproblem yes it includes the test plan with a great detail
noproblem    the test plan seems adequate enough to show that they understand what to test
noproblem few test plan is written the team can add more test plan
noproblem    test plans for both of their subtasks were   present
noproblem yes the authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system document is simple succinct and easy to understand great use of flow charts uml diagrams and mockups to visually represent the information is done   
noproblem    yes the author has provided a sufficient explanation of what changes needs to be done to the system by giving flow diagrams and screenshots about what changes they are going to incorporate in their system
noproblem team has added all the diagrams and screenshots the document is well explained and looks complete
noproblem yes their explanations are adequately explained the changes
noproblem 1 the authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system 2 they also have given the files to be modified added for each change   
noproblem authors have clearly explained all the changes to be made and where to make them the design document is quite clear and easy to understand
noproblem i think that the authors have done a really good job of explaining and covering all the changes to be made overall this is the best document i have seen so far
noproblem the document seems complete
noproblem yes one of the best design docs of project 4
noproblem the document was very well written previously too and they have improved it with diagrams and test nice work
noproblem the authors have considerably improved on the document uml diagrams as requested have been added
noproblem yes the design follows appropriate principles and patterns suggestions not required
noproblem    as the project is based upon making changes to the ui of the system thus there is no such specific pattern being followed however the design that they have made available in the form of screenshots appear very much inclined with the functionalities that they need to implement
noproblem design is good
noproblem yes their design is very sound and principles and patterns are used appropriately
noproblem 1 the design appears to be sound 2 also follows proper design principles eg for making changes to nomination and review questions inheritance is used inheriting methods from questions parent class
noproblem they have explained very well
noproblem yes the design follows simple rails concepts and is pretty straightforward i would like to see if the team uses existing gems available to speed up implementation and re use      
noproblem yes looks clean any design patterns used
noproblem yes the design appears to be sound and well made   
noproblem yes the design appears to be sound there could be some rearrangement in the mock up layout e g text box for email address and add button could have the same horizontal alignment for a better user interface
noproblem the design   seems to be very simple i think the team has avoided unnecessary complications and are doing minimal changes to existing system to solve issues given to them
noproblem the design approach seems justified and inline with the functionalities required to be implemented they have mentioned step wise details for all the changes they are going to take done a good job no rework required
noproblem    yes the design is presented in a much simpler form which gives a very clear picture of how the changes are going to be implemented and which functionalities would be witnessing the changes also as they have provide the screenshots it enhances the understanding about the project more
noproblem yes their design is simple and clear enough to read and understand
noproblem 1 the design is simple and well modularized 2 each method is implementing only one task as it should
noproblem the design does appear to be as simple as possible the team have not unnecessarily complicated the project
noproblem yes the design is pretty simple and to the point the design proposed is very clear and talk why each change is necessary
noproblem    the design is straightforward and as simple as possible the team has thought this project out very clearly and laid the same in the form of flowcharts and mock ups this has greatly reduced the complexity of the project and helped decrease the chances of clutter and confusion
noproblem yes adequate amount of details present
noproblem yes    the requirements are simple and the design plan clearly explains all the points
noproblem yes design appears to be very simple
noproblem yes the design is quite simple
noproblem yes they have done a great job to adequately explained their changes
noproblem they have done this part
noproblem yes they have well explained their design
noproblem yes the design appears to be sound and appropriate
noproblem great use of uml diagrams flowcharts and mock ups by the team to clearly explain the flow of their work it is   easy to understand the flow and how the end product will look like
noproblem the design appears to be sound
noproblem they team has done awesome work in representing every detail possible in the flow diagrams they have created uml diagrams which depicts the flow of the admin and students along with other actors as mentioned earlier they have also represented the admin flow diagram and instructor flow diagram through the flow chart which makes it very easy for end user to understand the workflow of the requirements in the expertiza system
noproblem    yes the visualization is pretty clear and good
noproblem proper use of uml to explain the use cases and flow charts to explain the workflow has been done the plan is complete
noproblem yes the design appears to be as simple as possible the team has mentioned what needs to be done and how they plan to implement it
noproblem the design seems straightforward and simple
noproblem yes their visualization is good they are clear and well described the changes
noproblem in my view they are simple and clear
noproblem simple design with the use of interface and apis
noproblem the design seems to be quite simple
noproblem the design document includes flow charts uml diagrams and screenshots which is really impressive as it made the document easier to understand
noproblem the design appears to be simple
noproblem i loved the overall use of the visualizations which aids to the understanding of the whole doc the formatting of the documentation makes it really easy to read and understand
noproblem a suggestion would be to add some visualization about what the offscreencanvas does would be helpful
noproblem since it is a mozilla project testing is not necessary but the previous design documentation does touch upon the specifics of testing how an offscreencanvas is rendered
noproblem yes the presence of use case diagrams and flow charts explaining the work flow is good it would be nice if there were more uml diagrams such as sequence so show various class interactions    presence of mockup screens is good that helps in understanding what is being implemented it would have been good if the authors put in more details about the validations that that propose in the system  
noproblem yes the   uml   diagrams sufficiently provide visualization
noproblem the authors have added uml diagrams as requested in the previous review and it has made a lot of difference the explanation is much clearer now
noproblem test plan outlines the functionalities that the team will test and it seems sufficient to test the changes
noproblem they team has done tremendous job in following the test driven approach for the project implementation they have already included the tests they are writing for the functionality implementation they have covered the exhaustive scenarios   for the project in their test their test plan is highly appreciative
noproblem    the test plan is quite good as it covers all the test cases in the form of 11 test cases which test all the functionalities for the admin and the instructor role it also considers the negative test cases like throwing an exception when the pending instructor tries to add more then 10 students to his her course
noproblem tests can be made more exhaustive for now it looks like only the view will be tested but controller should be tested as well
noproblem yes they include the test plan
noproblem 1 the test cases cover all of the functionalities that they are going to implement
noproblem yes the document includes a test plan there was no test plan present in the previous version of the design document but the team included the test plan in the second round the test plan is clear and seems like it would really test the functionalities
noproblem the test plan has been written in a very good way following the great   quality of documentation till the end it covers all the edge cases and scenarios
noproblem the test plans are excellent the best i have seen so far it has accurately taken all test cases into consideration and described the layout of the final test in the form of a pseudo code well done on the test plan
noproblem yes test plans are included
noproblem yes the test plan looks good it covers all the functionalities
noproblem test plan seems thorough and well thought   out
noproblem the team is following a test driven development approach they have defined the test cases that need to be tested after the implementation it seems to completely test the feature
noproblem yes the issues and the proposed solutions are clearly written
noproblem yes they have
noproblem yes this is the best design i have reviewed it has clearly explained the changes in steps the formatting is great and it s very well made with very good design details and objectives it also included the current scenario and a typical score table it should be great if there s an expected final outcome visualization as well
noproblem yes the authors have adequately described the changes required to be made to the system the process has been divided into steps and each step describes changes in the mvc files good job
noproblem the problem and the changes needed is explained clearly
noproblem yes they explained a lot with two steps
noproblem i really loved the way that the authors have provided a detailed proposed plan section making it very clear about the changes that are required to be made in order to tackle the given problem statement
noproblem the authors have described 1 2 solutions of the problem however i would suggest them to include more about how these changes will be done and where are these changes going to occur what files will be affected etc
noproblem all problem statements have been explained this time including an elaborate test plan
noproblem yes the author explained the plan clearly the steps and the files need to be modified are listed
noproblem as far as the issues are concerned the solutions do seem logical
noproblem yes it looks sound
noproblem the   design is sound it completely follows the instructions it also has detailed implemenation plan in each steps i think it follows the dry principle because it uses existing implementations fully understood the existing implementations and added the functions above i think it should also follow the factory pattern although not shown in the design doc
noproblem yes the system is well designed and the ui looks neat as well they have put effort into the ui thinking process
noproblem yes they have
noproblem explained details about their solution and what will be changed after their implementation
noproblem yes changes to be made are clearly explained
noproblem they have explained in detail about the proposed changes with individual diagrams for each case it is very thorough in explanation
noproblem great documentation tbh the best i have seen yet      
noproblem they have documented it in a very rehearsed manner
noproblem the design document is really well written it clearly describes what needs to be done how it needs to be done and what code changes need to be made the files and tables affected are clearly listed
noproblem the authors have prepared the design document quite well
noproblem the author has explained extensively about the changes to be made to the system
noproblem yes the problem definition and the proposed solution are pretty clear they also provide some diagrams to explain their project which is helpful
noproblem their introduction and problem definition are clearly enough to explained the changes
noproblem with er diagram and database details the design looks good
noproblem the design follows appropriate principles and patterns as required
noproblem yes the proposed changes make only required additions
noproblem yes it follows   appropriate principles   
noproblem the design appears to be sound it is really well structured it is easy to follow it clearly states the changes to be made and the files affected by these changes
noproblem the design appears to be sound and clearly indicates the proposed code changes
noproblem the design follows appropriate principles but no design patterns have been used
noproblem yes the design is appropriate
noproblem yes they provide solution for different problem situations
noproblem yes it is fairly simple
noproblem no complex design only few places need to add functionalities and they all very similar
noproblem the design is simple although the er diagram takes a little time to decipher since it is quite big
noproblem yes the approach described in the design document is easy enough to understand they have also   backed their decision to go with the second approach with appropriate reasoning
noproblem the design is simple and quite comprehensive covering lots of methods of searching
noproblem yes based on the proposed solution it appears to be simple as possible
noproblem yes easy to understand
noproblem the design has been explained in a simple way the team has explained the design using use cases which is easy to comprehend
noproblem yes the design is simple and feasible
noproblem yes clear and simple
noproblem they have used apt visual aid like uml diagrams and screen shots
noproblem no class diagram but there is er diagram and tables for database it looks a little complex but give the idea of what is involving
noproblem necessary diagrams are included
noproblem the team has communicated their design clearly via use case diagram and a class diagram with a description of various database tables involved
noproblem excellent use of visualizations they already had an overall flow chart and this time additional tables and uml has been added best of what i ve seen
noproblem yes they do explain everything the er diagram use case diagram relevant tables explain everything
noproblem the project has great visualization a lot of uml diagrams have been included which makes the understanding the project easier the uml diagrams also clarifies what work is to be done
noproblem the team has described changes using use case and er diagrams to clearly explain the system
noproblem the authors add more diagrams to help to explain the change they are going to make the relevant tables are really helpful
noproblem test plans walk through necessary functionalities
noproblem the test cases described will cover the functionalities described given that they write multiples tests with the same structure as described for all search criteria   
noproblem a concrete test plan is also added and it has both ui and automated test details
noproblem yes this is done very well
noproblem they include a very described test plan it has everything proper what framework what tests all this information is well included they clearly specify what they aim to test
noproblem the test plan is pretty good and it has both ui tests and automated tests   
noproblem the test plan is designed efficiently they have described the ui tests and automated tests which cover most of the cases   
noproblem two types of testing are listed and the authors list all the cases they need to test
noproblem yes the authors have significantly improved the writeup and very adequately explained the changes that they ve made
noproblem the wiki is detailed enough that it mentions all the functionalities required in the project the team has made sure to   explain all the changes they wish to make to the system they list all columns that need to be sorted and how they will implement the sorting
noproblem the authors have explained enough about the changes
noproblem the team has added uml diagrams images of related web pages and provided details on jquery tablesorter that explains well the changes the team plans to make
noproblem great improvements compared to the previous submission now its a   very well written document good job team
noproblem yes the team has elaborated their design approach and changes to system in detail they have mentioned all the file changes and also provided sample code for reader understanding
noproblem they made clear explanation about their task for example their provide pictures to show what they need to do      
noproblem the design is very efficient and follows the standardized software engineering practices   
noproblem the design is sound because it has plans of file modification of implemented solution and very detailed testing plan the dry principle might not be well followed since in each testing the tester needs to log in as a super_administrator2 again and there are five testings   
noproblem the design is sound and easy to understand the design proposed also sounds logical i e to sort team names alphabetically and grades numerically to sort by both ascending and descending order
noproblem yes the design seems to be sound
noproblem the authors have justified the use of jquery table sorter by   listing its advantages
noproblem the team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made the design looks good and easy to implement   
noproblem the design appears to be specific to the requirements for this they have used a uml design which basically explains the flow of the use case they have not used any principles or design patterns however there does not seem a need to use any as their changes are limited to the html view and making a call to the tablesorter using jquery as per the document the design does not make any redundant changes or unnecessary changes to the code thus they have done a good job by optimizing the changes
noproblem yes as its sorting not much scope on design approach yet the team has documented well on their approach regarding multi level sortings that they are undertaking in few pages they have also considered cross browser compatibility of their jquery library which is a common design miss during client side changes
noproblem this project is not very difficult so they don t need to follow some principles or patterns
noproblem yes the design is very simple to understand and also the implementation is pretty clear and effective
noproblem the design is extremely simple and easy to understand good work guys
noproblem yes the solution proposed is simple by using the   jquery tablesorter gem
noproblem the use of jquery plugin sounds simple and easy to use
noproblem the design looks simple and clear
noproblem this their design is very simple and clear
noproblem this part has been significantly improved from the previous submission the diagram make it very easy for an outsider to understand the architecture the underlying problems and the proposed solution   
noproblem yes the figures added to the wiki clearly indicate the changes that will be made to each view the columns that will be made sortable and how will the made sortable good work
noproblem yes the team added visual aids like uml diagrams screen shots code snippets to clearly describe the changes to be made to the system well done
noproblem this team   used great diagrams that add to their documentation s clarity significantly
noproblem there are multiple visual   elements that improve the readability of the document screenshots of the ui tables help with the illustration of   the required changes furthermore    the uml diagram demonstrates the relation between relevant flows
noproblem the team has added good number of mock uis and uml diagram and clearly explains the code follow all of them are self explanatory and needs no improvement
noproblem diagram is added   
noproblem no visulization is necessary for this project
noproblem you have a lot of testing scenarios which is really good
noproblem the design doc includes the test plan which covers all the changes that will be made
noproblem there is a detail explanation on how the function testing will be carried out under the teating plan section of the wiki doc
noproblem yes it includes test plan it is very well written and will test the functionalities
noproblem test plans looks to be an overview of the functionality in the test plan i see the functionalities explained l
noproblem the test plan is complete and covers all intended functionalities they have also provided all necessary steps to test the functionality good documentation on test plan as client side changes using script is added a latency test to verify system is not slow in responding to sorting can be included
noproblem the test plan is thorough   
noproblem yes the authors do have an adequate explanation   
noproblem they have also added the uml diagrams which makes things a lot more clearer
noproblem the authors have very well explained all the changes that need to be done with the help of proper problem statement the files that require modifications the current and the required state
noproblem good additions on the purpose and use case of your work
noproblem is decently explained
noproblem team has explain the changes to be made very well also screenshots of the system is helping to understand which part of system is changing
noproblem the introduction and proposed solution sections appropriately describes the problem and the approach to resolve the issue the changes proposed can be concisely implemented into the system they have enlisted use case diagrams for the entire scenario to be added to the rubrics
noproblem i cannot remember what the explanation looked like last week but the read through this week felt very clear the organization of the article felt like it followed the logic of a design project the problem statement felt like it was reduced to a clear concise set of requirements that are attainable the addition of the program flow diagram and an explanation as to why there is no uml diagram also helped to cement my understanding and set my expectations
noproblem good work on adding uml diagrams now the problem is very well explained
noproblem yes they have given a good detailed explanation of the planned changes
noproblem yes they include all the details in the functionality implementation
noproblem the authors have mentioned about the changes
noproblem yes clear and crisp
noproblem the authors have thoroughly explained the changes made to the system
noproblem the authors have lucidly explained the changes that are to be made to the system they show the current state of the system and the expected state which includes a new button to analyze the review content in the segmented text box the authors have specified 2 files that they plan to modify namely the view file response html erb and a partial _self_review html erb the team clearly show the format of the response popup with suggestion metrics that capture sentiment score sentiment tone whether suggestions are present or not chance of suggestions volume of text and the volume of text without stop words they also propose to improve the response time of extracting the output from the api one suggestion is that the team could have touched upon the working of the suggestion detection algorithm though it is not part of their current implementation they do mention that it is a black box and have included a link to the deployed nlp project for suggestion algorithm where users can test the suggestion metrics generated for custom text
noproblem yes they have explained it very well
noproblem the changes proposed are well explained and clearly indicate the intended output
noproblem the authors have adequately explained changes made to the system they have explained the problem and proposed solution clearly and supported it with appopriate diagrams
noproblem very detailed and precise solution explained thoroughly   
noproblem the desgn looks okay
noproblem the design appears sound
noproblem yes it seems very sound and workable
noproblem the design appears to be sound they are checking if its multiple round exists and adding the checkbox functionality
noproblem the design is clear and easy to interpret the team has provided a code snippet which explains the changes to be made in the system to implement the solution
noproblem the design lacked enough explanation about how will they deal with reviews when the box is    checked and unchecked for the naming of the function and database the name seems too long it is better to make the name shorter and easy to understand
noproblem basic complexity
noproblem looks simple
noproblem design doc shows a good amount of work to be done team has articulated changes to be made well that makes design doc simple to understand
noproblem the design is seems to be as simple as possible
noproblem yes according to what they wrote they are going to realize this project from 2 sides the instructor side and the student side the steps are very clear
noproblem the design appears to be simple and easily understandable
noproblem yes simple and straightforward
noproblem the design has been made as simple as possible the complexity of the design is simplified using flow charts
noproblem this is a fairly simple design
noproblem yes a variety of apt visual aid has been used like screenshots uml diagram etc
noproblem the team has used flowcharts and ui which was necessary for this project
noproblem the diagram in ui part states clearly the changes the authors intend to make and how it will be like the flow diagram explains clearly the design logic and help me understand what changes the team will make
noproblem the team has used mock ups and a flowchart to show the basic functionality
noproblem tests with different scenarios are provided
noproblem yes according to what they wrote they are going to realize this project from 2 sides the instructor side and the student side the steps are very clear
noproblem the team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made the design looks good and easy to implement
noproblem the authors have included an elaborate test plan which tests even the functionality they have missed to mention in the proposed design part of the document this is quite complete
noproblem the design seems to be clear such that it provides the implementation procedure to be followed to include the feature of adding student generated questions to the rubrics
noproblem they explained from their requirements and in their flow that they only need to plan to edit the view so there is no need for a uml
noproblem the design is sound
noproblem as per the documentation the design seems simple
noproblem looks very doable
noproblem yes from the diagrams i could say design and design flow is simple enough and team has well understood the changes to be made
noproblem yes the design is sound and clear majority of the work is done by the suggestion algorithm the team proposes to integrate this functionality into expertiza and also improve the response time this project does not need to incorporate any design pattern as only the view files are altered the project does not impact the degree to which it is object oriented
noproblem since the task is to integrate a web service in the existing system the design mentioned is sound and reasonably primitive   
noproblem yes it does based on the proposed solution
noproblem the design is good however there is no scope of using bad principles since the number of files that will be affected are minimal and restricted to just 2
noproblem the design doc is sound and i believe   no design patterns are required for this project
noproblem the design appears sound
noproblem yes the design in its current form seems straight forward
noproblem the requirements were distilled down to the fewest simple terms possible without over generalization it felt like they just gave me the tl dr statement without any fluffy words to waste my time and also feels like they have a strong grasp over what they are expected to accomplish
noproblem yes the design appears to be simple   
noproblem yes the design appears to be very simple
noproblem yes the design is very simple and easy to follow
noproblem the design appears to be simple and straightforward to implement the team has also included all the files that will be changed to achieve the desired results
noproblem the design appears simple to be executed based on the procedure specified and the list of diagrams given that it justifies the implementation to be carried out
noproblem yes the design is simple and illustrated well with the use of wireframes showing the current expected state and uml diagram showing the flow diagram it depicts that once the analyze button is clicked the request is sent as json which contains the text typed by reviewer in the segmented textbox to the api which generates the suggestion metrics the response contains the suggestion metrics like sentiment score sentiment tone presence of suggestions chance of suggestion total volume of text and volume of text without stop words   
noproblem yes the design is simple and clear the task is to integrate   a web service which returns a result in json format
noproblem the diagram is clear and easy to understand from the diagram the design may be easy and clear to implement more details should be provided to evaluate further about the complexity
noproblem yes it does appear to be simple as possible
noproblem the design is simple and easy to understand could be better if implementing some code level design
noproblem the design is as simple as it could be since the flow of logic is pretty linear and there is no scope of complexity the changes also seems to be restricted to just one file which is good and in keeping with sound principles
noproblem it would be better if uml and class diagram are added as a part of the documentation
noproblem team has provided good amount of use case diagrams which actually are heart of the whole design doc and explains the design and approach well
noproblem they have made some uml diagrams which could describe the changes
noproblem yes they use a lot of charts to explain the use cases great job
noproblem the use case diagrams provided to describe the role of each user through the flow and specify how each case maps to another in order for the desired functionality to be achieved
noproblem the diagram is logistic and it s easily to tell the logic behind the changes by reading these diagrams i can get an understanding of this project quickly
noproblem yes the flow charts are complete and readable all cases are included
noproblem the design appears very simple
noproblem the project does not necessarily need diagramatic explanations but uml diagrams have been used which show implementation plan fairly well
noproblem the screenshots of the expertiza system are very helpful in understanding the problem and the solution
noproblem the flow diagram mentioned in the document clearly explains the changes need to be done
noproblem the author has excellently explained about the changes that they would be making by providing the design diagram and the screenshot of the the changes that they have incorporated also they have mentioned about their choice of tool which is google chart and why do they prefer so overall a good explanation
noproblem changes that s needs to be made has been explained correctly
noproblem yes their doc has adequately explained the changes
noproblem the team have a well written design document and and the authors have explained the proposed changes well the authors have also listed each file they are going to be changed
noproblem yes the team has well explained the changes that they are going to make last time it was a bit confusing but this time because of   the help of the diagrams and mock ui screen the solution seems clear now
noproblem the authors have explained the changes made to the system the design flow greatly helps to understand the flow of the system
noproblem yes this team has made the best use of visualization tools that can be applied to their project they have clearly shown wireframes of the current response page juxtaposed with the expected state with the analyze button next to each rubric the document also includes the flow of the project represented as uml diagram once the analyze button is clicked the request text is sent to the suggestion detection algorithm the api returns the response which contains the suggestion metrics like sentiment score sentiment tone presence of suggestions chance of suggestion total volume of text and volume of text without stop words   
noproblem the authors have described what all changes they plan to do and where they plan to do it compared to the previous version of the design document they have now included what tools and framework they plan to work on the design document looks complete and understandable now
noproblem they will be changing mostly html and erb code to create a visual interface that delivers information to instructors more effectively
noproblem the proposed changes have been explained in a simple manner
noproblem the   use of visualization is not pivotal for this task as it can be explained theoretically as well but still the team has made an effort to present the task with help of a flow diagram
noproblem yes very well explained
noproblem the document adequately describes the project description and proposals made the proposed change of generating a single or single bar chart graph based on the categories selected to display the chart can be efficiently made to the system
noproblem they have improved the document to provide a better description of changes to be made to the system
noproblem the screenshots clearly display where the output would be displayed
noproblem yes the design is sound and gives a proper explanation about how their implementation would behave
noproblem design seems correct
noproblem yes their design is clear and sound and the principles and patterns are well used
noproblem yeah their design seems to be sound and neat
noproblem system is well defined  
noproblem the uml diagrams clearly descibes the design of the solution the screenshots explain changes required in the system adequately
noproblem the design document is good and i don t think any design pattern needs to be followed as very few changes are being made   
noproblem the design makes use of the google charts tool to generate visual charts for specific criteria set based on the design flow it appears that the functionality can be consistently performed to generate the visual graph for the instructor
noproblem yes the design appears to be sound and uses appropriate design principles
noproblem yes the design is pretty simple and inclusion of screenshot enhances the clarity of what the team has achieved in terms of the required changes   
noproblem design is simple and easy to understand
noproblem yes uml diagram is provided and it is detailed flow diagrams explains how suggestions will be given   
noproblem yes the design is simple and easy to understand i can easily know what they will do through their doc
noproblem the design appears to be very simple and well written they have explained the use case diagram very well also they have added visualizations
noproblem yes the design is simple and easy to understand  
noproblem the team is using external tools to do the work and its clear and easy
noproblem the document is really simple to understand once you get to understand the flow however initially it appears to be difficult
noproblem i think more tests can be added
noproblem from the reasons provided for choosing the google charts tool and it s effectiveness it can be integrated into the system functionality easily making the design simpler to be executed
noproblem yes design involves google charts api   and seems very simple
noproblem yes the design flow and the screenshots very clearly describes the changes made to the system
noproblem flow diagram explains the flow correctly
noproblem yes they have used visualization to help people understand their design
noproblem they have worked on their weak   point earlier their solution does not seem cogent but i would say now they have made good progress
noproblem the sample data visualizations is good the way they have given visualizations for sample data is nice easier to understand and good
noproblem the use cases appear to offer a quality general test approach to see if their design does what it should
noproblem test cases have been added   
noproblem the team already has mockups for their design
noproblem the visualization is great the screenshots clearly indicate the proposed output of the project
noproblem really good visualization provided
noproblem the project does not have any testing involved as such but the authors have added a testing plan
noproblem according to the team the specification of the project does not require us to use automated tests    but they plan to test the modified ruby code or the new features using   the   rspec   testing framework overall the test   plan sounds good  
noproblem no tests are required for the project as stated
noproblem this team did not require any tests
noproblem the test plan section specifies that it does not require performing any automated tests however since the new functionality of adding a visual diagram the team would modified ruby code for the functions added to the grades_controller
noproblem the test plan is complete the team plans to test the two possible cases 1 when the review is blank response should be no review in text box 2 when review is present response is the result of suggestion metrics analysis the team is right in testing just these two cases because they should not test if the api itself is returning a correct response as that would be against testing rules
noproblem yes functional tests with scenarios provided
noproblem the design doc includes the test plan which covers changes in the functionalities
noproblem yes the issues and the proposed solutions are clearly written
noproblem yes they have
noproblem yes this is the best design i have reviewed it has clearly explained the changes in steps the formatting is great and it s very well made with very good design details and objectives it also included the current scenario and a typical score table it should be great if there s an expected final outcome visualization as well
noproblem yes the authors have adequately described the changes required to be made to the system the process has been divided into steps and each step describes changes in the mvc files good job
noproblem the problem and the changes needed is explained clearly
noproblem yes the design is clear and the details are succinct
noproblem the design   looks simplified but there might be some edge cases that needs handling such as what if a student makes his her review public this review is selected by the power user to create a sample and then the student wishes to make the review private
noproblem yes the approach is explained in detail
noproblem the design is proper
noproblem it is simple enough and also achieves the required features
noproblem the uml diagram is very good and makes understanding very easy
noproblem yes the test plan section is again detailed with step by step instruction
noproblem team has explained the problem statement approach to solve the issue well also the use case diagram explains design well
noproblem design doc is not complex and every section of the menu explains the itself with simplest term possible
noproblem very basic explanation
noproblem simple design
noproblem    the team has well explained the changes which are required to be made in the system they have broken the explanation of the details of the requirement in simple bullet points which makes it very easy to understand the change requested the design approach  
noproblem the   steps taken by the team to implement the functionality is very clear and detailed as stated above the approach discusses the   step wise action that the team is going to take for the implementation
noproblem the team has come up with a very detailed and clear step wise test plan for all the actors involved they have done great work to depict the flow for every user which makes sure they are handling all the scenarios this also suggests their approach is behavior driven they have done great job in this and the test are in depth
noproblem while i m awaiting to receive the details which are pending on the implementation i feel the general nature of the changes is well explained   
noproblem confronted with a tricky problem in creating links between different assignments across semesters to aggregate the reviews i was really impressed with the way they plan to accomplish this feature
noproblem i like the use case diagram but i would like class diagrams or a database visualization too so it s easier to understand how the cross course assignment linking will work
noproblem detailed test plan 1
noproblem the authors have adequately mentioned the desired changes in the approach and design section the problem statement gives the gist of the issue at hand including adding feature to make student s reviews public the proposals specified are effective to deal with the issue by creating a new mvc framework
noproblem the design and fixes are coherently described and are logical to be implemented for the given functionality the issues are stated properly allowing the reader to understand it and the fixes suggested are enlisted in an appropriate manner
noproblem the design makes it clear to understand the procedure adapted to realize the goal the authors have made it a point to describe the tasks carried out in a simpler manner allowing the reader to realize the approach towards the issue   
noproblem the uml use case diagram takes into consideration the system specifications and the manner in which the users interact with each other in the process it makes it easy to analyze how the implementation can take place in the current scenario   
noproblem the test plan section properly describes the flow that needs to be followed by each actor involved in the process this could be enhanced either by providing a flow diagram or adding certain test case snippets for the scenarios
noproblem the design seems pretty simple and straightforward   
noproblem yes based on the explanation given the design seems appropriate and will achieve the desired end results good job
noproblem the design is concised and clear only makes the required changes and introduces no duplications
noproblem yes they explained a lot with two steps
noproblem i really loved the way that the authors have provided a detailed proposed plan section making it very clear about the changes that are required to be made in order to tackle the given problem statement
noproblem all problem statements have been explained this time including an elaborate test plan
noproblem yes the author explained the plan clearly the steps and the files need to be modified are listed
noproblem as far as the issues are concerned the solutions do seem logical
noproblem yes it looks sound
noproblem the   design is sound it completely follows the instructions it also has detailed implemenation plan in each steps i think it follows the dry principle because it uses existing implementations fully understood the existing implementations and added the functions above i think it should also follow the factory pattern although not shown in the design doc
noproblem yes the system is well designed and the ui looks neat as well they have put effort into the ui thinking process
noproblem although the design provided is clear there might be some more work needed to optimize it properly and make it work as intended   
noproblem the design appears to be sound and seems to follow all the appropriate principles as far as i am concerned and as mentioned earlier i would again like to point out that the proposed plan section has been handled really well
noproblem the document is very well structured and is quite easy to follow they have explained each and everything stepwise
noproblem yes the design seems appropriate and suitable for the case maybe the author could specify the patterns they use in the document
noproblem yes simple straightforward solutions
noproblem the design is simple
noproblem the design is both simple and clear it should be better to add another step for the comparison of the instructor review and the student review both as a final examination and a testing
noproblem yes the design is as simple as possible however they have only described the proposed design they could have provided simple mock ups or samples
noproblem yes pretty simple great job
noproblem the design appears to be simple to the best of my knowledge not a lot of files needed to be changed signifying that they are just targeting specific files in order to make minimum number of changes possible not making it too complex
noproblem the document is well explained thus it reduces complexity and makes itself appear quite easy for the user to understand however more diagrams and flowcharts would have helped even more
noproblem the design is as simple as possible and described in a straightforward manner
noproblem the design seems simple and feasible
noproblem necessary visual inputs are present to aid explanation
noproblem yes appropriate visual cue is present in the form of screen shots
noproblem there are visual aids included with the design depicting the current state of the system as well as proposed icons to institute the design changes
noproblem the authors provide some screenshots which make their project more clear it would be better if they provide more diagrams to explain their solutions
noproblem i see test cases properly defined but the test plan is missing
noproblem yes the test plan is included i think the tests will cover all scenarios
noproblem the testing appears to be pretty rigorous they have taken into account cases when ta instructor s scores should be excluded the test cases could have been better described
noproblem team has done a good job in identifying the cases that needs to be tested it will be an improvement if they can add details on how they plan to test each controller view separately
noproblem yes there is a detailed test plan for this project not only basic features testing but also other more testing
noproblem the test plan looks really thorough covering all the possible scenarios i am personally happy with the given test plan
noproblem yes the authors have significantly improved the writeup and very adequately explained the changes that they ve made
noproblem the authors have explained the changes to be made to the system including screenshots of the tables uml diagrams as well as all the files that will be modified suggestion although all the details are explained well in the document by writing the changes proposed to the files in bullet points or by using a diagram the document will be easier to read
noproblem the authors have explained enough about the changes
noproblem the team has added uml diagrams images of related web pages and provided details on jquery tablesorter that explains well the changes the team plans to make
noproblem great improvements compared to the previous submission now its a   very well written document good job team
noproblem yes the team has elaborated their design approach and changes to system in detail they have mentioned all the file changes and also provided sample code for reader understanding
noproblem they made clear explanation about their task for example their provide pictures to show what they need to do      
noproblem the design is very efficient and follows the standardized software engineering practices   
noproblem the design is sound and easy to understand the design proposed also sounds logical i e to sort team names alphabetically and grades numerically to sort by both ascending and descending order
noproblem yes the design seems to be sound
noproblem the authors have justified the use of jquery table sorter by   listing its advantages
noproblem the team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made the design looks good and easy to implement   
noproblem this project is not very difficult so they don t need to follow some principles or patterns
noproblem yes the design is very simple to understand and also the implementation is pretty clear and effective
noproblem the design is extremely simple and easy to understand good work guys
noproblem yes the solution proposed is simple by using the   jquery tablesorter gem
noproblem the use of jquery plugin sounds simple and easy to use
noproblem the design looks simple and clear
noproblem the modifications that are suggested by the team are minimalistic and cover the   changes that are   necessary for the javascript library to work while it is possible to infer the majority of changes that will be introduced in this project    it would be better if the authors elaborated on the implementation of all   the views as opposed to discussing only the view submissions table   
noproblem this their design is very simple and clear
noproblem this part has been significantly improved from the previous submission the diagram make it very easy for an outsider to understand the architecture the underlying problems and the proposed solution   
noproblem yes the figures added to the wiki clearly indicate the changes that will be made to each view the columns that will be made sortable and how will the made sortable good work
noproblem the flowchart added gives a good idea of the final outcome after implementation of the changes proposed suggestion a diagram explaining the plan of changes to be made will make the document easier to read
noproblem this team   used great diagrams that add to their documentation s clarity significantly
noproblem there are multiple visual   elements that improve the readability of the document screenshots of the ui tables help with the illustration of   the required changes furthermore    the uml diagram demonstrates the relation between relevant flows
noproblem the team has added good number of mock uis and uml diagram and clearly explains the code follow all of them are self explanatory and needs no improvement
noproblem diagram is added   
noproblem no visulization is necessary for this project
noproblem you have a lot of testing scenarios which is really good
noproblem i suggest the testing plan be improved in place of giving steps on how a reviewer should test the project the team should instead list how they wish to write tests for the functionality added the rspec could be something like expect page to have_content sorted
noproblem the design doc includes the test plan which covers all the changes that will be made
noproblem there is a detail explanation on how the function testing will be carried out under the teating plan section of the wiki doc
noproblem yes it includes test plan it is very well written and will test the functionalities
noproblem test plans looks to be an overview of the functionality in the test plan i see the functionalities explained l
noproblem the test plan is present it consists of a set of functional tests described for each of the five views i would suggest elaborating on the technical side of tests for example specifying which spec files will be modified or whether or not the project will utilize rspec moreover it would be better if the team provided a rationale for why it is sufficient to use only functional tests
noproblem the test plan is thorough   
noproblem they have discussed clearly what functionalities they are going to test to make the project more efficient i think they have made a quite descent research in the testing aspect of the project
noproblem the design includes the test plan
noproblem yes the test plan looks good the author lists all the cases they need to   test
noproblem yes the authors have made changes to the design document and are more specific about how exactly they plan to implement the new functionality
noproblem the team has mentioned properly what changes they are doing and how they will be doing them in the first submission they had suggested the possible approaches now they are having a concrete way they are implementing these changes
noproblem yes and at times much more than necessary   
noproblem no changes has been done
noproblem yes they explained a lot for the changes great job
noproblem    the authors have done good job explaining the changes to be made to the system and even explaining why other more obvious options are not chosen it still sounds like a complicated change to make to the system
noproblem the team added more information from the last time which aided in a better explanation of the problem good job team
noproblem 1 the authors have adequately explained the changes to be made to the design document
noproblem the explanations are more than sufficient not only have the authors explained the changes to the system but also explained the reasoning for considering those changes i like the way that they also explained the other different ways they could ve integrated the github metrics but avoided those methods with sufficient reasoning for the same the team has also given an explanation of their database design modifications would be like which is good
noproblem the authors have dived into the depths when explaining the changes all of the changes are well defined and precise
noproblem yes excellent work done by the team the design document adequately explains what is the problem that they are trying to solve what is the proposed solution and how the solution would look like    there are enough details to in the document to understand what is being done and what changes are proposed the document also has enough illustrations on what is the current situation   
noproblem yes they did
noproblem the authors adequately explained   the changes   they plan to make
noproblem yes
noproblem the authors have very well explained the problem statement and the changes to be made to the system including flowcharts the files to be modified added and useful links
noproblem authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system the design document was easy to understand
noproblem the team is going to improve compatibility with web content that relies on the webaudio api by implementing missing pieces of incomplete node types oscillatornode along with entire missing nodes constantsourcenode stereopannernode iirfilternode   
noproblem yes they made detailed explanation about their changes
noproblem the design seems to be flawless all the principles and patterns used are flawless and to the point
noproblem yep they have good structure to show what and how they gonna do with the project
noproblem the design looks good the code is already committed and approved by the concerned team good job
noproblem yes their design appears to be sound
noproblem the design appears to be sound and following appropriate principles
noproblem the design seems to be sound they have a sample design where they are explaining the tables and how they plan to work with them as well the examples provided help understand how the data will be stored
noproblem yes
noproblem yeah their   proposed design includes workflow initial step and subsequent steps it was easy to follow their design their solution appears to be sound
noproblem yes i am   surprised that they have already finished the project   
noproblem    the design appears to be sound they have weighed their options and are using an official gem to interact with the github api
noproblem i don t   see any issue in the design document they have followed a good design principle
noproblem 1 the authors have mentioned several approaches in which these functionalities could be implemented 2 their chosen approach is follows mvc architecture and dry principles
noproblem    the design sound very reasonable
noproblem the design is concise and clear
noproblem yes
noproblem the design is concise and clear they have added reference images of how the system would look after their changes which properly shows the expected implementation results
noproblem yes it is thoroughly investigated
noproblem the design is simple and easy to understand the sin waves and the description about it helps to properly understand the changes made and its impact
noproblem the design was not unnecessarily complex it was as easy as it could be
noproblem their design is much simple and clear also easy to understand
noproblem yeah i believe it is as simple as possible while choosing the best path for the expertiza project to grow but it still sounds like a very ambitious project for 1 group to complete
noproblem use of flowcharts and step by step explanation simplified   their solution it was easy to grasp and design also appears to be simple
noproblem very simple and clear
noproblem with proper documentation the problem is explained nicely and understanding of the complex problem is made easier
noproblem 1 have clearly mentioned when will github api be hit to retrive the data and which gem will be used
noproblem    their design is simple and clear
noproblem the team has done tremendous job in adding visualization aids they have added application flow diagrams and visualized images they have also included screenshots to explain the code functionality implementation of enabling self reviews and score pages this makes the document descriptive and very easy to read and understand      
noproblem self explanatory visual changes have been added all the changes are described via the visual aids
noproblem yes the flow diagram and graph plots help to understand the changes and its implications the diagrams clearly describe the change approach followed
noproblem the flowcharts included in the design document clearly explain the changes that need to be done
noproblem the design document includes proper visualization it included appropriate flow charts and screenshots which made it easier to understand the design document and the project
noproblem yes the team has used flowcharts and diagrams which clearly describe the changes to be made to the system
noproblem they provide pictures of their sound waves
noproblem yes the authors are using already existing gems for the implementation i would have liked to see a section on caching if any    rest the solution proposed looks simple and straightforward and looks that it will easily integrate into the current system   
noproblem the provided tests are in depth and will test the changes made thoroughly
noproblem they have pretty good test plan as there is no code yet
noproblem the use case diagram properly shows how the addition of this feature will help for   the instructor role
noproblem the visualizations used by the team are comprehensive and well made
noproblem good design
noproblem excellent use of screenshots made things very clear for me
noproblem yes they use a lot of diagrams to show use case
noproblem    the photos included are superb at showing the expected view they can have more 1 or 2 more stars if most of the expteriza work for the github metrics was already completed when they made these screen shots do you think it is feasible to expect that you can start a software project before getting a green light on the project in order to include high quality pictures of your proposed view in action
noproblem it included a proper test plan there was no test plan included in the previous version of the design document but authors have added it in the second round which made the design document complete
noproblem explains the different approaches with the help of use case diagram
noproblem the design does include test plan and plans to test the functionalities  
noproblem    they not only use use case diagram but also mock up screenshot to help the reader understand their design
noproblem no
noproblem yes it includes the test plan with a great detail
noproblem good test plan should include more test cases that check the functionality of github integration eg if number of lines of code committed by a student is correctly computed
noproblem    test plans for both of their subtasks were   present
noproblem yes the authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system document is simple succinct and easy to understand great use of flow charts uml diagrams and mockups to visually represent the information is done   
noproblem    yes the author has provided a sufficient explanation of what changes needs to be done to the system by giving flow diagrams and screenshots about what changes they are going to incorporate in their system
noproblem team has added all the diagrams and screenshots the document is well explained and looks complete
noproblem yes their explanations are adequately explained the changes
noproblem 1 the authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system 2 they also have given the files to be modified added for each change   
noproblem authors have clearly explained all the changes to be made and where to make them the design document is quite clear and easy to understand
noproblem i think that the authors have done a really good job of explaining and covering all the changes to be made overall this is the best document i have seen so far
noproblem the authors have explained all the changes to be made very clearly and concisely each change is supplemented with sufficient diagrams and mock ups so as to make the final task of visualization easier
noproblem the document seems complete
noproblem yes one of the best design docs of project 4
noproblem the document was very well written previously too and they have improved it with diagrams and test nice work
noproblem the authors have considerably improved on the document uml diagrams as requested have been added
noproblem yes the design follows appropriate principles and patterns suggestions not required
noproblem    as the project is based upon making changes to the ui of the system thus there is no such specific pattern being followed however the design that they have made available in the form of screenshots appear very much inclined with the functionalities that they need to implement
noproblem design is good
noproblem yes their design is very sound and principles and patterns are used appropriately
noproblem 1 the design appears to be sound 2 also follows proper design principles eg for making changes to nomination and review questions inheritance is used inheriting methods from questions parent class
noproblem the design seems to be appropriate and sound it follows appropriate principles
noproblem yes the design appears to be very sound and follows all the principles that i know i loved the format of the documentation as well
noproblem they have explained very well
noproblem yes the design follows simple rails concepts and is pretty straightforward i would like to see if the team uses existing gems available to speed up implementation and re use      
noproblem yes looks clean any design patterns used
noproblem yes the design appears to be sound and well made   
noproblem yes the design appears to be sound there could be some rearrangement in the mock up layout e g text box for email address and add button could have the same horizontal alignment for a better user interface
noproblem the design   seems to be very simple i think the team has avoided unnecessary complications and are doing minimal changes to existing system to solve issues given to them
noproblem the design approach seems justified and inline with the functionalities required to be implemented they have mentioned step wise details for all the changes they are going to take done a good job no rework required
noproblem    yes the design is presented in a much simpler form which gives a very clear picture of how the changes are going to be implemented and which functionalities would be witnessing the changes also as they have provide the screenshots it enhances the understanding about the project more
noproblem yes their design is simple and clear enough to read and understand
noproblem 1 the design is simple and well modularized 2 each method is implementing only one task as it should
noproblem the design does appear to be as simple as possible the team have not unnecessarily complicated the project
noproblem yes the design is pretty simple and to the point the design proposed is very clear and talk why each change is necessary
noproblem    the design is straightforward and as simple as possible the team has thought this project out very clearly and laid the same in the form of flowcharts and mock ups this has greatly reduced the complexity of the project and helped decrease the chances of clutter and confusion
noproblem yes adequate amount of details present
noproblem yes    the requirements are simple and the design plan clearly explains all the points
noproblem yes design appears to be very simple
noproblem great use of uml diagrams flowcharts and mock ups by the team to clearly explain the flow of their work it is   easy to understand the flow and how the end product will look like
noproblem they team has done awesome work in representing every detail possible in the flow diagrams they have created uml diagrams which depicts the flow of the admin and students along with other actors as mentioned earlier they have also represented the admin flow diagram and instructor flow diagram through the flow chart which makes it very easy for end user to understand the workflow of the requirements in the expertiza system
noproblem    yes the visualization is pretty clear and good
noproblem proper use of uml to explain the use cases and flow charts to explain the workflow has been done the plan is complete
noproblem yes their visualization is good they are clear and well described the changes
noproblem the design document includes flow charts uml diagrams and screenshots which is really impressive as it made the document easier to understand
noproblem yes the   uml   diagrams sufficiently provide visualization
noproblem the authors have added uml diagrams as requested in the previous review and it has made a lot of difference the explanation is much clearer now
noproblem test plan outlines the functionalities that the team will test and it seems sufficient to test the changes
noproblem they team has done tremendous job in following the test driven approach for the project implementation they have already included the tests they are writing for the functionality implementation they have covered the exhaustive scenarios   for the project in their test their test plan is highly appreciative
noproblem    the test plan is quite good as it covers all the test cases in the form of 11 test cases which test all the functionalities for the admin and the instructor role it also considers the negative test cases like throwing an exception when the pending instructor tries to add more then 10 students to his her course
noproblem yes they include the test plan
noproblem 1 the test cases cover all of the functionalities that they are going to implement
noproblem yes the document includes a test plan there was no test plan present in the previous version of the design document but the team included the test plan in the second round the test plan is clear and seems like it would really test the functionalities
noproblem the test plan has been written in a very good way following the great   quality of documentation till the end it covers all the edge cases and scenarios
noproblem the test plans are excellent the best i have seen so far it has accurately taken all test cases into consideration and described the layout of the final test in the form of a pseudo code well done on the test plan
noproblem yes test plans are included
noproblem yes the test plan looks good it covers all the functionalities
noproblem test plan seems thorough and well thought   out
noproblem the team is following a test driven development approach they have defined the test cases that need to be tested after the implementation it seems to completely test the feature
noproblem yes changes to be made are explained clearly document is very clear includes necessary diagrams mock ups and everything possible to make anyone understand what the issues are and what team is planning to do to resolve them everything is included in a proper order like for each issue there is a separate flowchart and mock up no suggestions required
noproblem yes the authors have adaquately explained the changes to be made in the system
noproblem the document is clearly and neatly written all the necessary sections are present with good explanations
noproblem changes are well explained with good visual aids
noproblem they have explained every change   they want to make to fix the issue the diagrams in turn help a lot to understand the flow of the system
noproblem yes the authors have adequately explained all the changes that need to be made each issue has a separate list of changes to be made and which files need to be edited
noproblem the changes are very well documented for each issue what are the files that needs to be changed is mentioned appropriately the overall design looks efficient and avoids any duplication good job
noproblem both the problems and proposed changes are clearly detailed my only suggestion is to put the description of the issue being solved in the same location as the solution to it otherwise one has to scroll around the page to figure out which problem is being fixed
noproblem yes they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection they have not only given proper uml diagrams and the like but they have also implemented the code and showcased in the test plan and the proposed design section   
noproblem in round one team has well explained their approach and how are they going to do it in this round they have included detailed information and mock ui it was easy to relate their approach their test plan is also thorough i think the team would definitely be able to incorporate the new changes good job guys

noproblem very good use of class and sequence diagrams to explain the entire design flow it clearly conveys the thought   process of authors and the overall design
noproblem lots of great visualizations are provided that outline a good amount of detail
noproblem the team has added their mock ui which shows they have thought about the changes and modification mock uis of the screen shows they are halfway the project   
noproblem the class diagram is very useful and the mock ui   with indication on it make it more useful
noproblem yes design is informative change proposal is detailed it describes well about how changes are to be implemented
noproblem the diagram is perfect and clear
noproblem yes design does include a well described test plan the provided tests will surely test the functionalities which will be implemenedt the test plan is represented in a wonderful manner including pre steps and different testing expectations great work no suggestions are required
noproblem the test plan is comprehensive
noproblem they have covered all the test plans along with detailed steps
noproblem the test plan is thorough and contains lots of detail that will make it easy to design rspec tests in the future
noproblem the test plans are thorough and they gone ahead and shown it in detail by breaking them into steps such as pre steps functional ui and performance testing this is a very good way to achieve in depth analysis of the problem and check how effective the solution is
noproblem i have to say their test plan includes user interface testing performance testing database testing etc i have to say they have worked really hard for it i have not yet come across any team who has a test plan like this   
noproblem an appropriate test plan is included in this design doc
noproblem yes the test coverage seems good
noproblem 1 the authors have explained the functionalities and the changes to be made to the project in depth
noproblem the authors have made a comprehensive document that clearly outlines the changes that they made they have included the uml diagram depicting the flow of control the design section lists the files that were modified and newly created it also comprises the contents of the summary sheet that gets displayed once an instructor clicks the 360 assessment icon lowfi ui and a prototype revealing the relevant fields that are to be displayed in the grade summary
noproblem the team has mentioned the problem statement and its importance by giving an example of how it saves the time of instructors
noproblem the changes are well explained with the help of use case uml diagrams screen shots of the web pages and prototype of the view well done
noproblem yes the proposed changes and intended output is clearly mentioned in the design document
noproblem the team has done a pretty good job of explaining the changes they are intending to make in great detail they have added more details from the earlier version
noproblem the design looks fine    team has provided the initial test plans a lo fi sketch is available as well the team could have put git links to the test plan code for better organization
noproblem 1 the design doc is clearly explained 2 follows the right design principles

noproblem yes the design looks accurate and well thought through   
noproblem 1 simple and clear design   
noproblem the design is simple and easy to understand because of ample explanation the authors have also worked on the activity uml diagram for this round making it easier for the readers to understand all areas have been covered with respect to presenting the design lucidly
noproblem the proposed design is easy to understand and explained properly with the   help of appropriate screenshots of the view
noproblem actual project work has not started yet so code modifications have not been mentioned however the files to be changed seem appropriate
noproblem yes
noproblem yes the design is quite simple and easy to understand the authors have taken a straightforward approach to implement the feature
noproblem uml and class diagram is not possible since the view is the main part 1 the team explains how the final view should look like in detail
noproblem yes the document makes extensive use of visual aids be it activity diagram uml screenshots of the views lowfi ui sketch of the grade sheet and a prototype of the view showing grade sheet with expertiza s color scheme and style conventions all these tools clearly project the changes that are made to the system
noproblem the team has made a great effort to explain the design through a   uml diagram and screenshots of how the feature will work when added to the existing project

noproblem using a lofi sketch the team clearly shows the intended output
noproblem the authors have included flow diagrams wire frames and even real screen mock ups they really help improve clarity
noproblem 1 the test comprehensively tests the functioning of the system
noproblem the team has completed the implementation and have included the screenshots of the rspec code that tests the   assessment360_controller rb   and specifically the course_student_grade_summary method they test whether the instance variables provided in the view have been properly instantiated without concerning too much about the values that they hold they back this up with a link to ruby s best practice guide for functional tests for controllers plus they include feature tests to check whether correct details are displayed they have also justified the reason for not performing unit tests as they don t alter the model the highlight of this document is the video links showing the tests performed kudos to the team for the effort
noproblem the test design   includes both controller as well as feature tests the team has also   made an effort   by putting up video links of the running of tests
noproblem the authors have explained well on how they intend to test the controllers and features given that the project does not involve any changes to model files i think      ruby on rails guide functional tests for your controllers is a good way to go
noproblem the tests cover all the required functionality and as it is mentioned controller tests make more sense than unit tests
noproblem yes tests are explained thoroughly with written code   
noproblem the authors have proposed an elaborate test plan and it covers the entirety of the functionality they are building
noproblem authors have explained well the changes to be made in the system
noproblem they have mentioned all the changes that have to be made to fix the issues the screenshots with which changes are to be made in the code explains a lot
noproblem    the authors have described all the proposed changes well each issue and with it it s detailed code is given well written and solid effort

noproblem the authors have highlighted certain parts pf the design where the changes were made this makes is easier for the reader to understand the changes made the team has explained the changes made in a clear manner
noproblem the design and fixes are very well explained with codesnips that include the incorporated adjustments nice work
noproblem yes the design follow the principle and they have added designs for each issue specifying every detail which is quite a task
noproblem    yes the design appears to be sound and follows ruby principles no code has been repeated and they are using pre written functions in many places instead of just writing the logic again good work
noproblem the design proposed solutions look completely logical and should fix the bugs with no least redundancy it also looks like the team has already managed to fix a few bugs as well kudos to them
noproblem the design appears to be sound i would make the same choices they did to address the issues
noproblem well it looks sound to me it follows the dry principles as well
noproblem the design appears to be sound and following appropriate principles the document is also well described
noproblem all the issues are stated and addressed nicely the design looks good
noproblem the design appears to be clear and the team has also implemented functionality to their project it shows that the team has organized and implemented the design well

noproblem design is simple and easy to understand
noproblem the design is very clear and helps in better understanding the flow of the system
noproblem the design proposal is coherent and easy to understand the proposed design and steps for solution are also logical the team have done a lot of work to think about how to solve the bugs good job guys
noproblem design appears really simple only a couple of added lines here and there
noproblem the design looks perfect it is neither overly simple nor it is too complicated
noproblem the design seems to be as simple as possible authors have not unnecessarily complicated the approach but rather have given a simple approach for various fixes
noproblem yes it looks simple based on the code snippets they have given and by the diagrams
noproblem yes the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the review section   
noproblem the team has explained the issues and their solutions clearly the design is simple hence easy to understand the proposed solution section is well written where the team has described the changes made in respective files
noproblem    the visualization provided in the form of flow diagrams in very easy to understand however er diagrams of main db tables could have been provided because it is difficult to understand the data flow and inter relation between tables
noproblem the diagrams in the wiki clearly describe the flow for proposed changes to the system we can clearly decipher from the diagrams what the intended functionality is good job
noproblem no class diagram was needed and their flow charts and code snippets show the control logic simply   
noproblem the team has put uml diagrams for every issue which clearly explains the issue and the workflow
noproblem the document includes flowcharts which clearly describe the project flow and what needs to be done
noproblem yes it does
noproblem could have included some screenshots otherwise great work by the team on uml diagrams
noproblem the team has provided flow charts that explain the working of the system the team has provided flowcharts for each issue which is commendable
noproblem the provided diagrams are visualizations of the workflows of different actors in the context of given five issues they further clarify the changes that are to be made in this project
noproblem detailed test plans are mentioned in the wiki which probably covers all the cases
noproblem    yes the design includes a test plan the tests really test the functionality and also test adverse conditions to see whether error messages are being shown
noproblem the test plan section defines the steps needed to manually test the functionalities but i would suggest the team to also include the logic they propose to use in the rspec tests the objects they would mock etc
noproblem test plan is included but it makes many references to manual tests the tests they state could be automated in a straight forward manner
noproblem the test plan has all the manual testing and automatic testing to be done on each issue
noproblem the test plan is included in the document    both manual and automated testing test plans are given which is appreciable   
noproblem elaborative test plan which is really good
noproblem test plans are present and explained in detail    the tests are really in depth for each issue the team will be fixing
noproblem the team has improved their design by adding extra test cases and test procedures which were lacking in the previous submission the team has provided test cases for each issue thereby testing every functionality of the project
noproblem the design appears to be sound and seems to follow all the appropriate principles as far as i am concerned and as mentioned earlier i would again like to point out that the proposed plan section has been handled really well
noproblem the document is very well structured and is quite easy to follow they have explained each and everything stepwise
noproblem yes the design seems appropriate and suitable for the case maybe the author could specify the patterns they use in the document
noproblem yes simple straightforward solutions
noproblem the design is simple
noproblem the design is both simple and clear it should be better to add another step for the comparison of the instructor review and the student review both as a final examination and a testing
noproblem yes pretty simple great job
noproblem the design appears to be simple to the best of my knowledge not a lot of files needed to be changed signifying that they are just targeting specific files in order to make minimum number of changes possible not making it too complex
noproblem the design is as simple as possible and described in a straightforward manner
noproblem the design seems simple and feasible
noproblem the documentation done by the team is very detailed and explains the problem statement very clearly they have   described   the functionality change in bullet points which makes it very easy to understand the sub parts required to achieve the main functionality in simple terms   
noproblem yes the author has made a great attempt to explain the changes by trying to explain the changes required with the help of the application flow diagram and the use case diagram and how the changes were implemented by giving screenshots of the changes
noproblem the wiki page is very explanatory and the authors have explained the issue and fix very well
noproblem yes the required changes for the reviews is explained clearly the design for each required change is also explained in depth now
noproblem the authors have clearly mentioned the changes to be made using problem statement and use case diagram
noproblem yes they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection they have not only given proper uml diagrams and the like but they have also implemented the code and showcased in the implementation section   
noproblem the team explained   everything required and not leave anything behind
noproblem the design seems to be following the appropriate principles and uses the appropriate guidelines they usecase   diagram mentions each actor and the role associated
noproblem yes
noproblem yes the design is very simple and explains the changes required in a very clear manner
noproblem the flow and uml   diagrams are well designed and explain a lot about the system flow addition of detailed use case helps support the diagram
noproblem the design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the use case diagram in which the users are student and instructor and the data base is where the actions are stored in the database and the retrieved from the same for the case of reviews information    also they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the application flow section so as to elucidate the problem statement
noproblem i like the part where the peer review has been given more weightage in comparison to self review in the composite score
noproblem the design appears to followed appropriate   principles and patterns
noproblem es the design is very simple and explains the changes required in a very clear manner
noproblem the design is simple and very much in depth and follows   the principle
noproblem yes the design is simple and easy to understand for others too the explanation along with diagrams provides enough information to understand the use case
noproblem yes the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the review section   
noproblem yes the design looks simple no complications and the screenshots are really helpful
noproblem the design is as simple as possible
noproblem basic uml used
noproblem yes the application flow diagram tells of how the functionality will be accessed both by user and student and the use case diagram explains the interaction of the instructor and the students for the particular functionalities  
noproblem some ui screenshots are added along with design diagrams which describe the system the ui or mock ui helps in better understanding
noproblem the visualizations seem to be complete the team has included an application flow diagram a use case diagram and also a screenshot of how the actual result should look so in my opinion good job done
noproblem the team has done tremendous job in adding visualization aids they have added application flow diagrams for every actor along with the uml diagram of the student and instructor they have also included screenshots to explain the code functionality implementation of enabling self reviews and score pages this makes the document descriptive and very easy to read and understand      
noproblem the chart and diagrams are well done and help explain how the code will work
noproblem the use case diagram and application flow diagram very well explains the changes made to the system
noproblem yes the visuals provided with this doc are clear and just by that a lot can be understood
noproblem the test plan added is just a basic case and as the changes are just some calculations to be made test plan is not much of a requirement for the project
noproblem a test plan is included in this design doc
noproblem necessary visual inputs are present to aid explanation
noproblem yes appropriate visual cue is present in the form of screen shots
noproblem excellent use of visualizations
noproblem no diagrams present
noproblem there are visual aids included with the design depicting the current state of the system as well as proposed icons to institute the design changes
noproblem yes the test plan is included i think the tests will cover all scenarios
noproblem the testing appears to be pretty rigorous they have taken into account cases when ta instructor s scores should be excluded the test cases could have been better described
noproblem team has done a good job in identifying the cases that needs to be tested it will be an improvement if they can add details on how they plan to test each controller view separately
noproblem yes there is a detailed test plan for this project not only basic features testing but also other more testing
noproblem the test plan looks really thorough covering all the possible scenarios i am personally happy with the given test plan
noproblem they have discussed clearly what functionalities they are going to test to make the project more efficient i think they have made a quite descent research in the testing aspect of the project
noproblem the design includes the test plan
noproblem yes the test plan looks good the author lists all the cases they need to   test
noproblem they have a paragraph saying what they are going to do but it could be broken up into parts with images for better understanding
noproblem they have one scenario maybe a few more could help better test their work
noproblem yes the proposed solutions part clearly stated that they will go through each review to compare the new review score etc and then they will store the review url however the solution is not concrete enough and is a little bit hard to follow it should be great if there s more details in stating about how to loop through each reviews   
noproblem no changes has been done
noproblem yes they explained a lot for the changes great job
noproblem the team has mentioned properly what changes they are doing and how they will be doing them in the first submission they had suggested the possible approaches now they are having a concrete way they are implementing these changes
noproblem yes and at times much more than necessary   
noproblem yes the authors have made changes to the design document and are more specific about how exactly they plan to implement the new functionality
noproblem the team added more information from the last time which aided in a better explanation of the problem good job team
noproblem 1 the authors have adequately explained the changes to be made to the design document
noproblem the explanations are more than sufficient not only have the authors explained the changes to the system but also explained the reasoning for considering those changes i like the way that they also explained the other different ways they could ve integrated the github metrics but avoided those methods with sufficient reasoning for the same the team has also given an explanation of their database design modifications would be like which is good
noproblem yes excellent work done by the team the design document adequately explains what is the problem that they are trying to solve what is the proposed solution and how the solution would look like    there are enough details to in the document to understand what is being done and what changes are proposed the document also has enough illustrations on what is the current situation   
noproblem the authors adequately explained   the changes   they plan to make
noproblem the team has provided a code snippet which includes solution to their problem statement they have described the code and their proposed changes
noproblem by looking at the flow charts and uml diagrams submitted by the team their solution appears to be sound
noproblem the team has provided diagrams that make it easier for the reader to understand the workflow of the system and the changes that they have proposed to implement the solution
noproblem as mentioned the team has provided uml diagrams stating the two actors in their system student instructor and their interaction with the email module and database
noproblem the design seems to be sound they have a sample design where they are explaining the tables and how they plan to work with them as well the examples provided help understand how the data will be stored
noproblem yes
noproblem design is okay
noproblem yes
noproblem very basic design
noproblem no visualization
noproblem no test plan
noproblem    the design appears to be sound they have weighed their options and are using an official gem to interact with the github api
noproblem i don t   see any issue in the design document they have followed a good design principle
noproblem 1 the authors have mentioned several approaches in which these functionalities could be implemented 2 their chosen approach is follows mvc architecture and dry principles
noproblem    the design sound very reasonable
noproblem the design is concise and clear they have added reference images of how the system would look after their changes which properly shows the expected implementation results
noproblem yes it is thoroughly investigated
noproblem yes
noproblem their design is much simple and clear also easy to understand
noproblem with proper documentation the problem is explained nicely and understanding of the complex problem is made easier
noproblem 1 have clearly mentioned when will github api be hit to retrive the data and which gem will be used
noproblem    their design is simple and clear
noproblem the use case diagram properly shows how the addition of this feature will help for   the instructor role
noproblem the visualizations used by the team are comprehensive and well made
noproblem good design
noproblem excellent use of screenshots made things very clear for me
noproblem yes they use a lot of diagrams to show use case
noproblem use case diagram is present but it would have been nice to see a sequence diagram to understand the flow   
noproblem explains the different approaches with the help of use case diagram
noproblem    they not only use use case diagram but also mock up screenshot to help the reader understand their design
noproblem the test plan seems adequate at this stage edge cases may need to be considered at a later stage
noproblem no
noproblem the authors have explained well what changes they wish to make and how they plan to implement those changes i would suggest them to add more details like where do they store the list of responses more than the notification threshold overall good job
noproblem yes it includes the test plan with a great detail
noproblem    the test plan seems adequate enough to show that they understand what to test
noproblem yes the design is as simple as it can get understanding the principle is not hard but making it simple should also not make it costly good work to the team if the instructors were looking for something this simple
noproblem the uml diagrams given in the document list the process flow for testing understanding the changes which will be made in the document but unfortunately no diagram exists which describe the changes to be made    i would suggest the team to add diagrams for the pseudo code they may have written
noproblem    test plans for both of their subtasks were   present
noproblem a format of the proposed email to be sent would be helpful
noproblem some additional tests can be added
noproblem yes the problem statement and the proposed changes have been clearly explained
noproblem the design and application flow appear to be as simple as possible as well as the proposed code changes snippet provided
noproblem there are uml and application flow diagrams included with the design document which serve to make the proposed design changes much clearer
noproblem test plan is as simple as required for the problem statement in question
noproblem yes they include this part in the proposed solutions field it would be better if they use visualization to let the readers better understand the flow
noproblem the design seems workable maybe they can come up a more sound design for example they can try many ways to define the notification limit
noproblem the design is simple and really better than before
noproblem after the first review the design has improved significantly the proposed design clearly defines the changes being made by the team
noproblem there has been a significant improvement in the level of details provided the author can further improve the document by providing the details of the design pattern to be used
noproblem the design seems to be pretty straightforward
noproblem the author uses the uml diagram to properly describe the system   
noproblem the document does contain a test plan which can definitely be extended to incorporate   certain negative test cases
noproblem the design has improved and updates has been done and it is easy to comprehend the changes to be made to the system
noproblem the design seems simple
noproblem proper   diagrams are used by the team   
noproblem design doc includes the test plan but more detail on negative test cases would have been better
noproblem yes the use of visualization is great
noproblem i know exactly what this team is doing
noproblem it seems as though this team s approach was well designed
noproblem the way the team plans to loop through each review to calculate a review score seems slightly more complex than necessary but i agree with them taking this apporach as it will allow them to break down the reason why the scores are different
noproblem they have a lot of mockups showing what they plan to do  
noproblem yes they include a problem statement in this page the statement is clear and easy to understand
noproblem the team has well explained the changes to be made to the system
noproblem yes the authors have explained the changes to be made clearly along with diagrams
noproblem all the changes made to the system have been supplemented with explanations and mock ups
noproblem explanations are okay there needs to be more detail on what is being done and how the final outlook view would be as of now not much details have been put in the document a before and after view would have adequately shown the impact the this work will make   
noproblem yes there is few basic details mentioned in the document but not adequate changes are explained it s far better work than last round yet the team has to give a better overview on bacui and elaborate the problem statement
noproblem the team has updated their design document to include all the changes they are planning to make this is a good improvement from the earlier version
noproblem design is good
noproblem the design is reasonable and workable
noproblem since its ui based project their design is pretty intuitive and simple
noproblem there is no scope of using any design patterns or principles since this is a ui based project and there is no scope for the application of design principles
noproblem there is no design provided in the document as its mainly ui changes yet the team should have dived in detail about their choices to achieve a particular look and feel needed the document seems to be over simplification of the implementation and can be improved further   
noproblem the changes are to be made in the ui and the team is planning to use appropriate design elements
noproblem team plans to use all of the bootstrap functions and  
noproblem yes the design doc is simple and well explained
noproblem yes the design appears to be as simple as possible there are a limited number of bootstrap components being used the complexity of the project is limited and the end result appears to be as simple as possible
noproblem yes this looks simple with several point fixes required to be done the authors also talk about using bootstrap 4 which is good i would have liked if they could quickly put up certain mock screens using the bootstrap      
noproblem the tasks they need to do seems simple but more design details are needed
noproblem yes the design is very simple
noproblem team has done their best in visualizing whatever design they had
noproblem the diagrams added clearly explain which views need to be modified but if the team could just mark the point where changes are to be made in the screenshot it would be the icing on the cake still good work
noproblem they gave all the ui interfaces they are going to make it s suggested that they can include the origin page and the changed page   which the reader can compare with
noproblem they have included mock ui screens which make their proposed changes quite clear   
noproblem class diagrams uml diagrams do not apply here but explanation with snapshots is provided
noproblem not necessary since it s a ui based project
noproblem no i feel that that adequate visual aids and diagrams are missing in the document only a few screens to show it would have been better if the authors could have put before and after details on what is being done uml diagrams to show the flow and then justify the changes that they are trying to make     
noproblem make sure to test each interactions properly after the design is complete
noproblem no test plan section at all
noproblem since it s ui project they says they will test all the pages changed
noproblem since this is a ui based project they don t   need any functionality testing the team is planning to do manual testing which is all they need to for this project
noproblem no ui tests can be added here but the team has not considered them
noproblem no tests needed
noproblem no test plan
noproblem there are no tests included in the document but there is an issue need to be fixed which needs test plan to make sure it can work correctly also the ui need to test to guarantee the intended results
noproblem there is no test plan
noproblem yes the authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system document is simple succinct and easy to understand great use of flow charts uml diagrams and mockups to visually represent the information is done   
noproblem    yes the author has provided a sufficient explanation of what changes needs to be done to the system by giving flow diagrams and screenshots about what changes they are going to incorporate in their system
noproblem team has added all the diagrams and screenshots the document is well explained and looks complete
noproblem yes their explanations are adequately explained the changes
noproblem 1 the authors have clearly explained the changes to be made to the system 2 they also have given the files to be modified added for each change   
noproblem authors have clearly explained all the changes to be made and where to make them the design document is quite clear and easy to understand
noproblem i think that the authors have done a really good job of explaining and covering all the changes to be made overall this is the best document i have seen so far
noproblem the authors have explained all the changes to be made very clearly and concisely each change is supplemented with sufficient diagrams and mock ups so as to make the final task of visualization easier
noproblem the document seems complete
noproblem yes one of the best design docs of project 4
noproblem the document was very well written previously too and they have improved it with diagrams and test nice work
noproblem the authors have considerably improved on the document uml diagrams as requested have been added
noproblem yes the design follows appropriate principles and patterns suggestions not required
noproblem design is good
noproblem yes their design is very sound and principles and patterns are used appropriately
noproblem 1 the design appears to be sound 2 also follows proper design principles eg for making changes to nomination and review questions inheritance is used inheriting methods from questions parent class
noproblem the design seems to be appropriate and sound it follows appropriate principles
noproblem yes the design appears to be very sound and follows all the principles that i know i loved the format of the documentation as well
noproblem they have explained very well
noproblem yes the design follows simple rails concepts and is pretty straightforward i would like to see if the team uses existing gems available to speed up implementation and re use      
noproblem yes the design appears to be sound and well made   
noproblem the design   seems to be very simple i think the team has avoided unnecessary complications and are doing minimal changes to existing system to solve issues given to them
noproblem the design approach seems justified and inline with the functionalities required to be implemented they have mentioned step wise details for all the changes they are going to take done a good job no rework required
noproblem    yes the design is presented in a much simpler form which gives a very clear picture of how the changes are going to be implemented and which functionalities would be witnessing the changes also as they have provide the screenshots it enhances the understanding about the project more
noproblem yes their design is simple and clear enough to read and understand
noproblem 1 the design is simple and well modularized 2 each method is implementing only one task as it should
noproblem the design does appear to be as simple as possible the team have not unnecessarily complicated the project
noproblem yes the design is pretty simple and to the point the design proposed is very clear and talk why each change is necessary
noproblem    the design is straightforward and as simple as possible the team has thought this project out very clearly and laid the same in the form of flowcharts and mock ups this has greatly reduced the complexity of the project and helped decrease the chances of clutter and confusion
noproblem yes adequate amount of details present
noproblem yes    the requirements are simple and the design plan clearly explains all the points
noproblem yes design appears to be very simple
noproblem yes the design is quite simple
noproblem great use of uml diagrams flowcharts and mock ups by the team to clearly explain the flow of their work it is   easy to understand the flow and how the end product will look like
noproblem they team has done awesome work in representing every detail possible in the flow diagrams they have created uml diagrams which depicts the flow of the admin and students along with other actors as mentioned earlier they have also represented the admin flow diagram and instructor flow diagram through the flow chart which makes it very easy for end user to understand the workflow of the requirements in the expertiza system
noproblem    yes the visualization is pretty clear and good
noproblem proper use of uml to explain the use cases and flow charts to explain the workflow has been done the plan is complete
noproblem yes their visualization is good they are clear and well described the changes
noproblem the design document includes flow charts uml diagrams and screenshots which is really impressive as it made the document easier to understand
noproblem i loved the overall use of the visualizations which aids to the understanding of the whole doc the formatting of the documentation makes it really easy to read and understand
noproblem yes the   uml   diagrams sufficiently provide visualization
noproblem the authors have added uml diagrams as requested in the previous review and it has made a lot of difference the explanation is much clearer now
noproblem test plan outlines the functionalities that the team will test and it seems sufficient to test the changes
noproblem they team has done tremendous job in following the test driven approach for the project implementation they have already included the tests they are writing for the functionality implementation they have covered the exhaustive scenarios   for the project in their test their test plan is highly appreciative
noproblem    the test plan is quite good as it covers all the test cases in the form of 11 test cases which test all the functionalities for the admin and the instructor role it also considers the negative test cases like throwing an exception when the pending instructor tries to add more then 10 students to his her course
noproblem yes they include the test plan
noproblem 1 the test cases cover all of the functionalities that they are going to implement
noproblem yes the document includes a test plan there was no test plan present in the previous version of the design document but the team included the test plan in the second round the test plan is clear and seems like it would really test the functionalities
noproblem the test plan has been written in a very good way following the great   quality of documentation till the end it covers all the edge cases and scenarios
noproblem the test plans are excellent the best i have seen so far it has accurately taken all test cases into consideration and described the layout of the final test in the form of a pseudo code well done on the test plan
noproblem yes test plans are included
noproblem yes the test plan looks good it covers all the functionalities
noproblem test plan seems thorough and well thought   out
noproblem the team is following a test driven development approach they have defined the test cases that need to be tested after the implementation it seems to completely test the feature
noproblem the team has mentioned properly what changes they are doing and how they will be doing them in the first submission they had suggested the possible approaches now they are having a concrete way they are implementing these changes
noproblem yes the authors have made changes to the design document and are more specific about how exactly they plan to implement the new functionality
noproblem yes they explained a lot for the changes great job
noproblem 1 the authors have adequately explained the changes to be made to the design document
noproblem yes excellent work done by the team the design document adequately explains what is the problem that they are trying to solve what is the proposed solution and how the solution would look like    there are enough details to in the document to understand what is being done and what changes are proposed the document also has enough illustrations on what is the current situation   
noproblem the authors adequately explained   the changes   they plan to make
noproblem the design seems to be sound they have a sample design where they are explaining the tables and how they plan to work with them as well the examples provided help understand how the data will be stored
noproblem yes
noproblem yes
noproblem    the design appears to be sound they have weighed their options and are using an official gem to interact with the github api
noproblem i don t   see any issue in the design document they have followed a good design principle
noproblem 1 the authors have mentioned several approaches in which these functionalities could be implemented 2 their chosen approach is follows mvc architecture and dry principles
noproblem yes the github api integration looks good the only part missing was perhaps they could have documented the rest calls that they are going to make in the document as well usage of existing gems is good and eases lot of implementation pains   
noproblem    the design sound very reasonable
noproblem the design is concise and clear they have added reference images of how the system would look after their changes which properly shows the expected implementation results
noproblem yes it is thoroughly investigated
noproblem yes
noproblem their design is much simple and clear also easy to understand
noproblem yeah i believe it is as simple as possible while choosing the best path for the expertiza project to grow but it still sounds like a very ambitious project for 1 group to complete
noproblem with proper documentation the problem is explained nicely and understanding of the complex problem is made easier
noproblem    their design is simple and clear
noproblem yes the authors are using already existing gems for the implementation i would have liked to see a section on caching if any    rest the solution proposed looks simple and straightforward and looks that it will easily integrate into the current system   
noproblem the use case diagram properly shows how the addition of this feature will help for   the instructor role
noproblem the visualizations used by the team are comprehensive and well made
noproblem good design
noproblem excellent use of screenshots made things very clear for me
noproblem yes they use a lot of diagrams to show use case
noproblem explains the different approaches with the help of use case diagram
noproblem    they not only use use case diagram but also mock up screenshot to help the reader understand their design
noproblem the test plan does include a high level of testing scenarios the team plans to cover i would suggest the team should add bdd tests so they can test the same after the development phase is over
noproblem the test plan seems adequate at this stage edge cases may need to be considered at a later stage
noproblem no
noproblem yes it includes the test plan with a great detail
noproblem    the test plan seems adequate enough to show that they understand what to test
noproblem good test plan should include more test cases that check the functionality of github integration eg if number of lines of code committed by a student is correctly computed
noproblem the design includes a test plan however the test plan has nothing related to tests or which test cases are going to be considered it just explains the flow of how an instructor would reach the github metrics data page the team should at least mention which files are the test cases going to be written on and what functionalities are they going to test
noproblem the test section looks inadequate as of now only two test scenarios are mentioned and no details on automation or ui    more so no mention of tests in the document
noproblem    test plans for both of their subtasks were   present
noproblem the author has excellently explained about the changes that they would be making by providing the design diagram and the screenshot of the the changes that they have incorporated also they have mentioned about their choice of tool which is google chart and why do they prefer so overall a good explanation
noproblem changes that s needs to be made has been explained correctly
noproblem yes their doc has adequately explained the changes
noproblem the team have a well written design document and and the authors have explained the proposed changes well the authors have also listed each file they are going to be changed
noproblem yes the team has well explained the changes that they are going to make last time it was a bit confusing but this time because of   the help of the diagrams and mock ui screen the solution seems clear now
noproblem the authors have explained the changes made to the system the design flow greatly helps to understand the flow of the system
noproblem the authors have described what all changes they plan to do and where they plan to do it compared to the previous version of the design document they have now included what tools and framework they plan to work on the design document looks complete and understandable now
noproblem they will be changing mostly html and erb code to create a visual interface that delivers information to instructors more effectively
noproblem the proposed changes have been explained in a simple manner
noproblem the document adequately describes the project description and proposals made the proposed change of generating a single or single bar chart graph based on the categories selected to display the chart can be efficiently made to the system
noproblem they have improved the document to provide a better description of changes to be made to the system
noproblem yes the design is sound and gives a proper explanation about how their implementation would behave
noproblem design seems correct
noproblem yes their design is clear and sound and the principles and patterns are well used
noproblem the design documents is well explained the authors haven t mentioned any design pattern as such the authors have clearly stated the proposed changes though they could have added uml and crc cards
noproblem yeah their design seems to be sound and neat
noproblem system is well defined  
noproblem the design document is good and i don t think any design pattern needs to be followed as very few changes are being made   
noproblem the design makes use of the google charts tool to generate visual charts for specific criteria set based on the design flow it appears that the functionality can be consistently performed to generate the visual graph for the instructor
noproblem yes the design appears to be sound and uses appropriate design principles
noproblem yes the design is pretty simple and inclusion of screenshot enhances the clarity of what the team has achieved in terms of the required changes   
noproblem design is simple and easy to understand
noproblem yes the design is simple and easy to understand i can easily know what they will do through their doc
noproblem the design appears to be very simple and well written they have explained the use case diagram very well also they have added visualizations
noproblem yes the design is simple and easy to understand  
noproblem the team is using external tools to do the work and its clear and easy
noproblem using google charts is a good idea
noproblem from the reasons provided for choosing the google charts tool and it s effectiveness it can be integrated into the system functionality easily making the design simpler to be executed
noproblem yes design involves google charts api   and seems very simple
noproblem yes the design flow and the screenshots very clearly describes the changes made to the system
noproblem flow diagram explains the flow correctly
noproblem yes they have used visualization to help people understand their design
noproblem they have worked on their weak   point earlier their solution does not seem cogent but i would say now they have made good progress
noproblem the sample data visualizations is good the way they have given visualizations for sample data is nice easier to understand and good
noproblem the team already has mockups for their design
noproblem the visualization is great the screenshots clearly indicate the proposed output of the project
noproblem really good visualization provided
noproblem according to the team the specification of the project does not require us to use automated tests    but they plan to test the modified ruby code or the new features using   the   rspec   testing framework overall the test   plan sounds good  
noproblem no tests are required for the project as stated
noproblem this team did not require any tests
noproblem the design document does not include a test plan as testing requirement   is very minimal since most changes are in view
noproblem the test plan section specifies that it does not require performing any automated tests however since the new functionality of adding a visual diagram the team would modified ruby code for the functions added to the grades_controller
noproblem yes changes to be made are explained clearly document is very clear includes necessary diagrams mock ups and everything possible to make anyone understand what the issues are and what team is planning to do to resolve them everything is included in a proper order like for each issue there is a separate flowchart and mock up no suggestions required
noproblem yes the authors have adaquately explained the changes to be made in the system
noproblem the document is clearly and neatly written all the necessary sections are present with good explanations
noproblem changes are well explained with good visual aids
noproblem they have explained every change   they want to make to fix the issue the diagrams in turn help a lot to understand the flow of the system
noproblem yes the authors have adequately explained all the changes that need to be made each issue has a separate list of changes to be made and which files need to be edited
noproblem the changes are very well documented for each issue what are the files that needs to be changed is mentioned appropriately the overall design looks efficient and avoids any duplication good job
noproblem yes they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection they have not only given proper uml diagrams and the like but they have also implemented the code and showcased in the test plan and the proposed design section   
noproblem in round one team has well explained their approach and how are they going to do it in this round they have included detailed information and mock ui it was easy to relate their approach their test plan is also thorough i think the team would definitely be able to incorporate the new changes good job guys   
noproblem the design was well explained in this   design   doc
noproblem well explanation on problem statement uml diagrams flow charts given detailed explanation on problem statement   
noproblem yes
noproblem yes the document seems to be perfect it does follow all the appropriate principles and patterns no suggestions required
noproblem as far as the issues are concerned the solutions do seem logical
noproblem the design is apt following   the principles and are self explanatory
noproblem yes the design appears to be sound and the flow diagrams illustrate the flow of control very well
noproblem all good design principles are being followed where necessary
noproblem the design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the logical flow diagram   they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the proposed design section so as to elucidate the problem statement
noproblem the design appears to be neat   
noproblem the design appears to be sound following the appropriate   principles and patterns
noproblem yes well designed document ui mock ups given it is structured   
noproblem sound so many diagrams
noproblem yes it is the simplest design and minimal work which is required to resolve the issues it is very clearly explained    one can clearly understand the problem statement and the proposed solution for the same the design document is properly structured as well   
noproblem design is simple and easy to understand
noproblem yes simple straightforward solutions
noproblem the diagrams are very basic and covering the entire scope which is a good work by the team
noproblem yes the design is robust and simple to understand each class and view only handles a specific functionality i e it is modularised
noproblem yes the design is straight forward and easy to understand
noproblem the design appears to be simple given the task at hand
noproblem yes the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the staggered deadlines assignment section   
noproblem undoubtedly i like their color coding approach it s something very simple and apt for the current system
noproblem the design seems simple and clear
noproblem very clear
noproblem yes the provided diagrams deliver sufficient information about the implementation flowcharts and mock uis screenshots give a perfect picture of how the system will be after the required changes no suggestions required
noproblem flowcharts are drawn which describe the flow how the system will work after implementation
noproblem great use of mock ups really appreciate it
noproblem yes they have added mock ui screenshots which is exactly what they are going to and should do
noproblem yes the diagrams clearly illustrate the proposed flow different diagrams are provided for different issues one of the best wikis i have seen
noproblem very good use of class and sequence diagrams to explain the entire design flow it clearly conveys the thought   process of authors and the overall design
noproblem lots of great visualizations are provided that outline a good amount of detail
noproblem the team has added their mock ui which shows they have thought about the changes and modification mock uis of the screen shows they are halfway the project   
noproblem yes design is informative change proposal is detailed it describes well about how changes are to be implemented
noproblem the diagram is perfect and clear
noproblem yes design does include a well described test plan the provided tests will surely test the functionalities which will be implemenedt the test plan is represented in a wonderful manner including pre steps and different testing expectations great work no suggestions are required
noproblem the test plan is comprehensive
noproblem they have covered all the test plans along with detailed steps
noproblem the test plan is thorough and contains lots of detail that will make it easy to design rspec tests in the future
noproblem the test plans are thorough and they gone ahead and shown it in detail by breaking them into steps such as pre steps functional ui and performance testing this is a very good way to achieve in depth analysis of the problem and check how effective the solution is
noproblem i have to say their test plan includes user interface testing performance testing database testing etc i have to say they have worked really hard for it i have not yet come across any team who has a test plan like this   
noproblem an appropriate test plan is included in this design doc
noproblem yes the test coverage seems good
noproblem after the first review the design has improved significantly the proposed design clearly defines the changes being made by the team
noproblem yes the proposed solutions part clearly stated that they will go through each review to compare the new review score etc and then they will store the review url however the solution is not concrete enough and is a little bit hard to follow it should be great if there s more details in stating about how to loop through each reviews   
noproblem they have a paragraph saying what they are going to do but it could be broken up into parts with images for better understanding
noproblem the authors have explained well what changes they wish to make and how they plan to implement those changes i would suggest them to add more details like where do they store the list of responses more than the notification threshold overall good job
noproblem a format of the proposed email to be sent would be helpful
noproblem yes they include this part in the proposed solutions field it would be better if they use visualization to let the readers better understand the flow
noproblem the team has provided a code snippet which includes solution to their problem statement they have described the code and their proposed changes
noproblem i know exactly what this team is doing
noproblem yes the problem statement and the proposed changes have been clearly explained
noproblem the design has improved and updates has been done and it is easy to comprehend the changes to be made to the system
noproblem there has been a significant improvement in the level of details provided the author can further improve the document by providing the details of the design pattern to be used
noproblem design is okay
noproblem design does seem to be sound but complex as mentioned in the earlier review i am unsure if looping over each review is the correct thing to do or not maybe the team discussed this with the mentor and decided against it as no new information has been added in the document if so i would only suggest the team to include the complexity of the design in the   document
noproblem the design seems workable maybe they can come up a more sound design for example they can try many ways to define the notification limit
noproblem by looking at the flow charts and uml diagrams submitted by the team their solution appears to be sound
noproblem it seems as though this team s approach was well designed
noproblem the design seems to be pretty straightforward
noproblem the design is simple although it could be better if it has more concrete examples
noproblem yes the design is as simple as it can get understanding the principle is not hard but making it simple should also not make it costly good work to the team if the instructors were looking for something this simple
noproblem yes it simple but some parts are not easy to understand
noproblem the design is simple and really better than before
noproblem the team has provided diagrams that make it easier for the reader to understand the workflow of the system and the changes that they have proposed to implement the solution
noproblem the way the team plans to loop through each review to calculate a review score seems slightly more complex than necessary but i agree with them taking this apporach as it will allow them to break down the reason why the scores are different
noproblem the design does appear to be simple as they have not planned to modify any of the existing methods their new method will interact with   response assignmentquestionnaire model and then link the assignment to the review in the email however they have not mentioned if they have planned any data structure variable to store the assignment link and pass it on to the method where email notification will be sent but i suppose that storing it in a variable will suffice   
noproblem the design and application flow appear to be as simple as possible as well as the proposed code changes snippet provided
noproblem the design seems simple
noproblem the author uses the uml diagram to properly describe the system   
noproblem yes the use of visualization is great
noproblem they used the uml diagrams it really help me a lot when reading the wiki page maybe they can also make diagrams about the changes they are going to make
noproblem as mentioned the team has provided uml diagrams stating the two actors in their system student instructor and their interaction with the email module and database
noproblem the visualization aids used currently are application flow diagram and use cases they are useful to understand the scenario of the problem statement however a sequence or a communication diagram will really be beneficial to understand how the method interfaces with the other   methods this will help identify if the new method impacts other functionalities and will portray the proposed solution efficiently
noproblem there are uml and application flow diagrams included with the design document which serve to make the proposed design changes much clearer
noproblem proper   diagrams are used by the team   
noproblem the document does contain a test plan which can definitely be extended to incorporate   certain negative test cases
noproblem they have one scenario maybe a few more could help better test their work
noproblem some additional tests can be added
noproblem they did include a test plan it would be better if they also test the instructor side
noproblem the test plan seems overly simplistic it only tests whether the team s changes work in the most drastic scenario possible it seems like they should have more boundary value tests and more test cases to account for their new method of looping through the reviews to compare new reviews with previous ones
noproblem test plan is as simple as required for the problem statement in question
noproblem design doc includes the test plan but more detail on negative test cases would have been better
noproblem yes the authors do have an adequate explanation   
noproblem they have also added the uml diagrams which makes things a lot more clearer
noproblem i cannot remember what the explanation looked like last week but the read through this week felt very clear the organization of the article felt like it followed the logic of a design project the problem statement felt like it was reduced to a clear concise set of requirements that are attainable the addition of the program flow diagram and an explanation as to why there is no uml diagram also helped to cement my understanding and set my expectations
noproblem good work on adding uml diagrams now the problem is very well explained
noproblem the authors have lucidly explained the changes that are to be made to the system they show the current state of the system and the expected state which includes a new button to analyze the review content in the segmented text box the authors have specified 2 files that they plan to modify namely the view file response html erb and a partial _self_review html erb the team clearly show the format of the response popup with suggestion metrics that capture sentiment score sentiment tone whether suggestions are present or not chance of suggestions volume of text and the volume of text without stop words they also propose to improve the response time of extracting the output from the api one suggestion is that the team could have touched upon the working of the suggestion detection algorithm though it is not part of their current implementation they do mention that it is a black box and have included a link to the deployed nlp project for suggestion algorithm where users can test the suggestion metrics generated for custom text
noproblem yes they have explained it very well
noproblem the changes proposed are well explained and clearly indicate the intended output
noproblem the authors have adequately explained changes made to the system they have explained the problem and proposed solution clearly and supported it with appopriate diagrams
noproblem very detailed and precise solution explained thoroughly   
noproblem they explained from their requirements and in their flow that they only need to plan to edit the view so there is no need for a uml
noproblem documentation is proper team could have added db tables as well in the design doc
noproblem since the task is to integrate a web service in the existing system the design mentioned is sound and reasonably primitive   
noproblem yes it does based on the proposed solution
noproblem the design is good however there is no scope of using bad principles since the number of files that will be affected are minimal and restricted to just 2
noproblem the design doc is sound and i believe   no design patterns are required for this project
noproblem the design appears sound
noproblem yes design seems fit more insight required on the algorithm itself and how it will be implemented
noproblem yes the design in its current form seems straight forward
noproblem the requirements were distilled down to the fewest simple terms possible without over generalization it felt like they just gave me the tl dr statement without any fluffy words to waste my time and also feels like they have a strong grasp over what they are expected to accomplish
noproblem yes the design appears to be simple   
noproblem yes the design is simple and illustrated well with the use of wireframes showing the current expected state and uml diagram showing the flow diagram it depicts that once the analyze button is clicked the request is sent as json which contains the text typed by reviewer in the segmented textbox to the api which generates the suggestion metrics the response contains the suggestion metrics like sentiment score sentiment tone presence of suggestions chance of suggestion total volume of text and volume of text without stop words   
noproblem yes the design is simple and clear the task is to integrate   a web service which returns a result in json format
noproblem yes it does appear to be simple as possible
noproblem the design is as simple as it could be since the flow of logic is pretty linear and there is no scope of complexity the changes also seems to be restricted to just one file which is good and in keeping with sound principles
noproblem the actual project work might not have been started yet so the code modifications have not been mentioned but the files to be modified seem appropriate
noproblem the design appears very simple
noproblem the project does not necessarily need diagramatic explanations but uml diagrams have been used which show implementation plan fairly well
noproblem the flow diagram mentioned in the document clearly explains the changes need to be done
noproblem the screenshots of the expertiza system are very helpful in understanding the problem and the solution
noproblem the program flow diagram and an explanation as to why there is no uml diagram also helped to cement my understanding and set my expectations
noproblem uml diagram explains the changes
noproblem yes this team has made the best use of visualization tools that can be applied to their project they have clearly shown wireframes of the current response page juxtaposed with the expected state with the analyze button next to each rubric the document also includes the flow of the project represented as uml diagram once the analyze button is clicked the request text is sent to the suggestion detection algorithm the api returns the response which contains the suggestion metrics like sentiment score sentiment tone presence of suggestions chance of suggestion total volume of text and volume of text without stop words   
noproblem the   use of visualization is not pivotal for this task as it can be explained theoretically as well but still the team has made an effort to present the task with help of a flow diagram
noproblem yes very well explained
noproblem the screenshots clearly display where the output would be displayed
noproblem the uml diagrams clearly descibes the design of the solution the screenshots explain changes required in the system adequately
noproblem yes uml diagram is provided and it is detailed flow diagrams explains how suggestions will be given   
noproblem i think more tests can be added
noproblem the use cases appear to offer a quality general test approach to see if their design does what it should
noproblem test cases have been added   
noproblem the team has included test plan in connextra format by including the feature specification and two scenarios one happy path and one to capture the edge case of response generated with no text no more test cases can be added to check if the team s part in the project is implemented well some test case scenarios that check the efficiency of the suggestion detection algorithm for example to detect review responses that generate the generalized suggestion for all the projects can be included
noproblem the tests given tests there changes which is enough
noproblem the test plan is complete the team plans to test the two possible cases 1 when the review is blank response should be no review in text box 2 when review is present response is the result of suggestion metrics analysis the team is right in testing just these two cases because they should not test if the api itself is returning a correct response as that would be against testing rules
noproblem the test cases seem appropriate given that the only thing which needs to be tested is if the suggestion detection algorithm is displaying the intended output or not
noproblem the design doc includes the test plan which covers changes in the functionalities
noproblem their test plan includes a test case for successfully displaying the pop up text message as json and   displaying suggestion metrics for the review segment a block of review a comment box try to include test cases where a review message is absent i e the code should not break for empty review segment include a test case where review segment has a suggestion and test if the output says suggestion present include a negative test case for the the suggestion where a suggestion is not given by the reviewer and test that the output says suggestion absent
noproblem yes functional tests with scenarios provided
noproblem good additions on the purpose and use case of your work
noproblem the introduction and proposed solution sections appropriately describes the problem and the approach to resolve the issue the changes proposed can be concisely implemented into the system they have enlisted use case diagrams for the entire scenario to be added to the rubrics
noproblem the desgn looks okay
noproblem the team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made the design looks good and easy to implement
noproblem the design seems to be clear such that it provides the implementation procedure to be followed to include the feature of adding student generated questions to the rubrics
noproblem the design is sound
noproblem as per the documentation the design seems simple
noproblem looks very doable
noproblem yes from the diagrams i could say design and design flow is simple enough and team has well understood the changes to be made
noproblem yes the design appears to be very simple
noproblem yes the design is very simple and easy to follow
noproblem the design appears to be simple and straightforward to implement the team has also included all the files that will be changed to achieve the desired results
noproblem the design appears simple to be executed based on the procedure specified and the list of diagrams given that it justifies the implementation to be carried out
noproblem team has provided good amount of use case diagrams which actually are heart of the whole design doc and explains the design and approach well
noproblem they have made some uml diagrams which could describe the changes
noproblem yes they use a lot of charts to explain the use cases great job
noproblem the use case diagrams provided to describe the role of each user through the flow and specify how each case maps to another in order for the desired functionality to be achieved
noproblem the diagram is logistic and it s easily to tell the logic behind the changes by reading these diagrams i can get an understanding of this project quickly
noproblem yes the flow charts are complete and readable all cases are included
noproblem yes they have
noproblem explained details about their solution and what will be changed after their implementation
noproblem yes changes to be made are clearly explained
noproblem they have explained in detail about the proposed changes with individual diagrams for each case it is very thorough in explanation
noproblem great documentation tbh the best i have seen yet      
noproblem they have documented it in a very rehearsed manner
noproblem the design document is really well written it clearly describes what needs to be done how it needs to be done and what code changes need to be made the files and tables affected are clearly listed
noproblem the authors have prepared the design document quite well
noproblem the author has explained extensively about the changes to be made to the system
noproblem yes the problem definition and the proposed solution are pretty clear they also provide some diagrams to explain their project which is helpful
noproblem their introduction and problem definition are clearly enough to explained the changes
noproblem with er diagram and database details the design looks good
noproblem the design follows appropriate principles and patterns as required
noproblem the project consists of making a search function to select specific users assignments etc using some criteria so they re creating a search functionality for individual models

noproblem great use of mock ups really appreciate it
noproblem yes they have added mock ui screenshots which is exactly what they are going to and should do
noproblem yes the diagrams clearly illustrate the proposed flow different diagrams are provided for different issues one of the best wikis i have seen
noproblem very good use of class and sequence diagrams to explain the entire design flow it clearly conveys the thought   process of authors and the overall design
noproblem lots of great visualizations are provided that outline a good amount of detail
noproblem yes the diagrams are clear to show how the system works but they are not so lucid so as to show in the diagram how they are going to implement the changes in the system      
noproblem the team has added their mock ui which shows they have thought about the changes and modification mock uis of the screen shows they are halfway the project

noproblem they have covered all the test plans along with detailed steps
noproblem the test plan is thorough and contains lots of detail that will make it easy to design rspec tests in the future
noproblem the test plans are thorough and they gone ahead and shown it in detail by breaking them into steps such as pre steps functional ui and performance testing this is a very good way to achieve in depth analysis of the problem and check how effective the solution is
noproblem i have to say their test plan includes user interface testing performance testing database testing etc i have to say they have worked really hard for it i have not yet come across any team who has a test plan like this   
noproblem an appropriate test plan is included in this design doc
noproblem yes the test coverage seems good
noproblem the authors have explained the required changes in a concise manner
noproblem yes the project design is meaningful and clear the solution is well laid out
noproblem yes   
noproblem yes the authors have specified the changes to be made in the system under the proposed project design the changes have been included as sub heading with sub points under each the authors have also included a relevant files heading that includes the files where changes are made the changes involve allowing the instructor to change language for a course in the process a separate language column will be added to the courses table and a dropdown of languages in the edit courses page where a language can be chosen once the instructor updates the edit course page with the chosen language the static strings in the expertiza application will be changed to the chosen language for adding multi language support google translate and rails internationalization api is being used also two yaml files en yml and hi_en yml contains the translated strings for the respective languages the routes rb file and all the view files will be correspondingly modified to show the different languages after reading from the yaml files   
noproblem the explanations provided by the authors seems to be good they have referred the rails internationalization api guide which provides sufficient explanation for multi language support they have mentioned the different elements that will be changed and how an instructor would proceed to change the language of the course verbally in addition they have also added mock ups to visually represent this information
noproblem the explainations are succinct the description in technical design section and before after images clearly shows what the project intends to do
noproblem the changes are clearly mentioned they are very clear what and where to make changes only suggestion would be to include more about how these changes are going to be done   
noproblem adding a languages column to the courses table makes sense and so does leveraging third party apis to handle the translation
noproblem the design is as required following the appropriate patterns
noproblem as far as the issues are concerned the solutions do seem logical
noproblem it is sound
noproblem looking at the design there seems to be high use of cohesion   and low coupling it s good that all the changes are restricted to the routes rb and config locales files so that the resulting changes won t be messy and ruin the rest of the system also this helps in refactoring if needed in the future as there will be limited number of files to be changed

noproblem there were mock ups of the final result of the project however there were no uml diagrams i think the uml diagrams are not necessary for this project since the flow of how the instructor will change the language is fairly simple and one can understand it by just reading the document maybe they could have done a mock up of how some of the other views would have looked like once the language has changed especially the pages with flash messages if any currently they have just shown the proposed changes on the page where the instructor will change the language
noproblem the team have written a test plan but i feel more test cases could have been written to test the edge cases also the team could have explained their test cases in more detail
noproblem a testplan that covers the entire functionality has been devised it seems sufficient to test the change
noproblem the test plan is compatible with the problem statement

noproblem yes the deisgn appears to be totally sound the changes proposed are very standardized and follows appropriate industry standards
noproblem yes the design is very simple lucid and efficient
noproblem the visualization is by far the best part of this writeup also it s visualization is among the best i ve reviewed till date the author has put in a lot of efforts for the same the diagrams make the architecture and the problem statement very simple to understand
noproblem i understand what the team is supposed to do to the expertiza system
noproblem it was weird that two of the bugs they were assigned don t exist but that s not the team s fault
noproblem this team consistently uses great diagrams that add to their documentation s clarity significantly
noproblem the tests are really in depth for each issue the team will be fixing
noproblem after the first review the design has improved significantly the proposed design clearly defines the changes being made by the team
noproblem they have a paragraph saying what they are going to do but it could be broken up into parts with images for better understanding
noproblem the authors have explained well what changes they wish to make and how they plan to implement those changes i would suggest them to add more details like where do they store the list of responses more than the notification threshold overall good job
noproblem a format of the proposed email to be sent would be helpful
noproblem yes they include this part in the proposed solutions field it would be better if they use visualization to let the readers better understand the flow

noproblem there has been a significant improvement in the level of details provided the author can further improve the document by providing the details of the design pattern to be used
noproblem design is okay
noproblem design does seem to be sound but complex as mentioned in the earlier review i am unsure if looping over each review is the correct thing to do or not maybe the team discussed this with the mentor and decided against it as no new information has been added in the document if so i would only suggest the team to include the complexity of the design in the   document
noproblem the design seems workable maybe they can come up a more sound design for example they can try many ways to define the notification limit
noproblem by looking at the flow charts and uml diagrams submitted by the team their solution appears to be sound
noproblem it seems as though this team s approach was well designed
noproblem the design seems to be pretty straightforward
noproblem the design is simple although it could be better if it has more concrete examples

noproblem the team has provided diagrams that make it easier for the reader to understand the workflow of the system and the changes that they have proposed to implement the solution
noproblem the way the team plans to loop through each review to calculate a review score seems slightly more complex than necessary but i agree with them taking this apporach as it will allow them to break down the reason why the scores are different
noproblem the design does appear to be simple as they have not planned to modify any of the existing methods their new method will interact with   response assignmentquestionnaire model and then link the assignment to the review in the email however they have not mentioned if they have planned any data structure variable to store the assignment link and pass it on to the method where email notification will be sent but i suppose that storing it in a variable will suffice   
noproblem the design and application flow appear to be as simple as possible as well as the proposed code changes snippet provided

noproblem yes they look well written and easy to follow with all the visual aids
noproblem very well written document good job team
noproblem yes they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection they have not only given proper uml diagrams and the like but they are yet to implement the code and showcase in the uml diagram for review section         
noproblem the doc is very well written its like a blueprint to the project really appreciate the team efforts
noproblem i understand what the team is supposed to do to the expertiza system
noproblem the team has included all the details required to implement the given requirement the wiki has complete details related to requirements analysis of current designs and changes required to achieve the required functionality overall great job    the team did a great work in analyzing the issues and designing solutions for the issues the ui mock ups are included for all the issues which makes the document very easy to understand      
noproblem drastic improvements have been made to design doc

noproblem yes the deisgn appears to be totally sound the changes proposed are very standardized and follows appropriate industry standards
noproblem the design is sound with appropriate principles and patterns
noproblem clearly explained with diagrams and uml diagrams
noproblem    the design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the use case diagram in which the users are student and instructor and the data base is where the actions are stored in the database and the retrieved from the same for the case of reviews information    also they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the application flow section so as to elucidate the problem statement   
noproblem since the project is aimed at fixing the issues no design patterns need to be used
noproblem the team has analysed the existing design principles used in the project and has appropriately defined the design for the new changes which will be made the design looks good and easy to implement great work done   
noproblem the design appears to be simple and straightforward to implement the team has also included all the changes that will be made to achieve the desired results    great work
noproblem it was weird that two of the bugs they were assigned don t exist but that s not the team s fault
noproblem the explanation of each of the issues in details is done very well but it does seem to be complicated unless files to be modified and solutions are read
noproblem yes the design is a very simple and effective representation of the problem statement and they serve a good representation on how they are working and implemented the changes to the review section   
noproblem the design is simple   
noproblem yes only a few files are being modified
noproblem yes the design is very simple lucid and efficient
noproblem the design does not seem that complex the team has clearly mentioned the issues and the way to go about it

noproblem great use of mock ups and uml diagrams it makes understanding the issues easier looks like a great amount of thought has gone into making it   
noproblem the visualization is great all the flow diagrams and required screenshots are in place as required
noproblem the visualization is by far the best part of this writeup also it s visualization is among the best i ve reviewed till date the author has put in a lot of efforts for the same the diagrams make the architecture and the problem statement very simple to understand
noproblem a lots of visuals very helpful when viewers walk through the design
noproblem great work by the team on uml diagrams   
noproblem yes the diagrams are clear to show how the system works they have even gone a step ahead to show how they have thought of resolving the problem at each and every step of the expertiza review section and the message popups they receive for the same   
noproblem this team consistently uses great diagrams that add to their documentation s clarity significantly
noproblem the team has included a lot of visual aids which complements the document making it a lot easier to understand    great work with the ui mockups project design uml diagrams
noproblem given uml diagram which   are explaining the functionality appropriately   but class diagram would have been better to explain the detail code level change  
noproblem there are some test plans in place and others will be done after the bugs are generated suggestions it would have been great to have screenshots of the test plans
noproblem make include more details for test plan other than that the wiki looks very good
noproblem as per the requirement document test cases are not required
noproblem yes they have a working test plan in mind and also they have thought of the ways in which they are going to test the various edge cases for the various issues at hand
noproblem the aspect of re producing the issues are very clearly mentioned and hence tests are written briefly which can be easily understood
noproblem the tests are really in depth for each issue the team will be fixing
noproblem yes the explanations   provided for changes to be made are clearly mentioned the authors are very clear what and where to make changes    use of flowchart makes reviewer to understand their approach more quickly and easily suggestion no test plan is included in the project
noproblem the authors have explained the changes in depth and with proper details
noproblem yes the author has explained the adequately the changes to be made to the system by giving a detailed flow diagram of the workflow of the the would be implementing the functionality of keeping a track of the review time of a student
noproblem yes the author has explained the scope of the project very clearly and has specified the changes to be made in the project to accomplish the goal
noproblem yes the changes are well explained
noproblem explained very well
noproblem yes
noproblem the design document was well written initially too and still is
noproblem the design follows the required principle and the exact required patterns
noproblem yes the design is quite well understood and properly explained in a detailed manner through the flow diagram
noproblem not so good structure

noproblem it is clear and simple
noproblem yes it does they have given the proposed solution which   appears   to be simple
noproblem the design appears to be simple and is easy to understand
noproblem yes the database design and flowchart gives a clear picture what system will do after the required changes suggestion add before after changes screen mock ups to your document

noproblem this team consistently uses great diagrams that add to their documentation s clarity significantly
noproblem the team has included a lot of visual aids which complements the document making it a lot easier to understand    great work with the ui mockups project design uml diagrams
noproblem given uml diagram which   are explaining the functionality appropriately   but class diagram would have been better to explain the detail code level change  
noproblem yes they have a working test plan in mind and also they have thought of the ways in which they are going to test the various edge cases for the various issues at hand
noproblem tests are given at a very high level and need to be described properly
noproblem the tests are really in depth for each issue the team will be fixing
noproblem while i m awaiting to receive the details which are pending on the implementation i feel the general nature of the changes is well explained   
noproblem yes the approach is explained in detail
noproblem yes the design is clear and the details are succinct
noproblem the authors have adequately mentioned the desired changes in the approach and design section the problem statement gives the gist of the issue at hand including adding feature to make student s reviews public the proposals specified are effective to deal with the issue by creating a new mvc framework
noproblem the overall design looks good    however the author can add more details about the design principles being followed and appropriate patterns to be used
noproblem yes design shows a good amount of work to be done team is not using any design pattern   
noproblem the design is proper
noproblem confronted with a tricky problem in creating links between different assignments across semesters to aggregate the reviews i was really impressed with the way they plan to accomplish this feature
noproblem i am not convinced with the similar_assignments table schema for an assignment ax there is a foreign key that points to an assignment ay such that ax can be an assignment in say 2018 and ay can be the same assignment in 2017 but what if one of the reviews from assignment az which was in 2015 was really good and we need to include that as a sample and also include another review from aw from 2016 as a sample    according my understanding this above requirement cannot be met with the current db table design something that the team may look into
noproblem the design and fixes are coherently described and are logical to be implemented for the given functionality the issues are stated properly allowing the reader to understand it and the fixes suggested are enlisted in an appropriate manner
noproblem simple design
noproblem the   steps taken by the team to implement the functionality is very clear and detailed as stated above the approach discusses the   step wise action that the team is going to take for the implementation
noproblem design doc is not complex and every section of the menu explains the itself with simplest term possible
noproblem the design is concised and clear only makes the required changes and introduces no duplications
noproblem for as difficult a problem as linking assignments from one year to the next is they present an admirably simple design
noproblem it is simple enough and also achieves the required features
noproblem the design   looks simplified but there might be some edge cases that needs handling such as what if a student makes his her review public this review is selected by the power user to create a sample and then the student wishes to make the review private
noproblem the design makes it clear to understand the procedure adapted to realize the goal the authors have made it a point to describe the tasks carried out in a simpler manner allowing the reader to realize the approach towards the issue   
noproblem the team has represented the workflow through the uml diagrams which is very helpful to understand the flow of the requirement with multiple actors involved in the system however it would have been more helpful if they could add the design flow diagrams to explain the database design changes they are suggesting to be done the new table they are suggesting to make and   the fields they would map to could be shown through a entity relationship diagram which will make it easy for the end user to understand the attributes and the relationship of different entities involved due to the functionality change
noproblem the team has not used any class diagram
noproblem some mock ui where this is going to be implemented would be helpful
noproblem i like the use case diagram but i would like class diagrams or a database visualization too so it s easier to understand how the cross course assignment linking will work
noproblem there is one box for both review controller and assignment controller a better picture of how they handle each event differently would have been helpful
noproblem no test cases
noproblem the test plan section properly describes the flow that needs to be followed by each actor involved in the process this could be enhanced either by providing a flow diagram or adding certain test case snippets for the scenarios
noproblem the flowcharts included in the design document clearly explain the changes that need to be done
noproblem the design document includes proper visualization it included appropriate flow charts and screenshots which made it easier to understand the design document and the project
noproblem they provide pictures of their sound waves
