problem your team have put all let behind the code however there are still a lot of let response vmquestionresponse new review_questionnaire assignment 1 it is repetitive and unnecessary    
problem your home page is very clear as to  the application purpose unfortunately i am unable to sign up as a new user or login  with any of the pre configured user accounts included in the readme i can however attempt to sign up and or login but this information is never saved to the database for future access or the appropriate transitioning is not implemented i like that there are two options listed on the homepage to either sign up as a new user or to login in as a current user this is convenient for navigation consider spacing these links for easier identification i would also point out that the options in the drop down box included for selecting user type during sign up is a great idea the third option is a ambiguous as to its purpose what does it mean to sign up as a realtor who is also shopping for a house perhaps you can just limit the options to realtor or house hunter the functionality of searching homes should be included in the realtor services keep up the work once the database is successfully receiving user details and or the appropriate routes are assigned additional functionalities should be easy to implement
problem you should restrict the format of the website of company after add a company i can t edit and destroy my own company
problem you  haven t specified anything in  your readme file plus  you have given a link to heroku app but its not working please make sure its working i saw you guys had been committing code to your master branch have you guys pushed it to heroku that might be the reason it got broken

problem you  are not  testing anywhere yet
problem you are following good ruby coding practices for some places where you are comparing for example in login_controller rb if params login email admin admin params login password admin you can use a constant file where you can write these admin admin com and use that constant its not a good practice to write it like this otherwise everything seems good
problem you are following good coding practice i have a suggestion that you can move realtors admin and house hunters as childs of user that is admin belongs to user realtor belongs to user etc currently you have all the information in user model
problem yes from the system and code these code changes seem ready to be deployed in production after heavy integration testing as issues seem to be working but github pull request shows more fixes to work upon

problem yes well designed document ui mock ups given it is structured  
problem yes they surely have done a good job in mentioning the errors in the wiki doc   they have vaguely described the handling of the same but doubts remain in the details or the changes in the code   which  means that a better job  and  a more technical description of how  it is happening should be given so as to grasp a  better understanding for the same    
problem yes they surely have done a good job in mentioning the errors in the 1st part and the second part but it is unclear why the 3rd fix is a problem or how they have combatted the 3rd fix in the first place it just seems so that a screen shot has been put into place and they displayed a no method error popup they have vaguely described the handling of the same but doubts remain in the details or the changes in the code in fact no code screenshots have been put up for this case

problem yes there were some improvements that i noticed while testing the site features in the review duration which included modifications to view list of all houses created by company of which realtor is a part the program has scope for minimal improvements to make it function as needed
problem yes there is one commit during round 2 and it fixed trivial rubcop issues related to indentation   two suggestions of adding meaningful comments for tree_display function in tree_display jsx and second on having a single copy of rubricarray for two functions were not implemented
problem yes there is no mention of design pattern yet but overall design appear very clear to me
problem yes their code works pretty good but their coverage is a big problem

problem yes the writeup seemed to include everything that was required code was also attached along with the screenshots and steps
problem yes the writeup explains explains how the authors did their work and they have mentioned the steps behind each functionality design principles are not used but overall quite nicely explained

problem yes the wiki is clear and explains most aspects of the project but there could be a better explanation for the idl files that were added and the corresponding changes that were made because of adding these files
problem yes the wiki does explain the functionalities well could have been better to have more attributes in the subclasses in the diagram this could help the user know about the details of the strategy pattern used

problem yes the team made commits regularly but some commits whose name suggest changes to the code not heroku deployment were done after the deadline of 10th oct if those changes were later reversed or not cannot be ensured from the reviewer s perspective i would suggest not to add any changes at all after the deadline as we shouldn t be bothered about looking at  what change is done in each commit stick to the work you had as it would be graded appropriately by the instructors

problem yes the team has used flowcharts and diagrams which clearly describe the changes to be made to the system
problem yes the team has taken care of it by specially making a section of what is the problem as the introductory section of the wiki doc so as to make us understand the goals of the project they have even attached code snaps of the relevant changes they have in mind whilst explaining the error although one questions the details in which they should have gone into explaining the errors and resolution more mentioning of details is required

problem yes the team has made few code climate fixes and also added tests for the utf encoding issue though no test is available for the sanitize fixes  
problem yes the team has made a very good testing plan consisting of functional testing which covers almost all of the use cases which have been added modified however the author could have added code snippets of the same instead of just discussing the proposed plan

problem yes the team has considered the two important and required test cases 1 to check whether assignments is not present in the instructor view and check the presence of open student view button in the flyout menu here the team has also checked the precondition whether the user is viewing the correct page tree_display list which is meant for the instructor   2 to check the presence of close student view button for the instructor to return back to the default view and have the assignment   tab for students   suggestion the team could add a line to check whether the system returns back to the instructor page after clicking the close student view button maybe include expect page to have_current_path tree_display list    
problem yes the team has committed changes in round 2 also overall it looks like the codes were pushed to master and one go regularly committing the files could have been better
problem yes the team has added test cases the code for a couple of test cases are in the wiki in a separate section again it would have been better to explain the test cases a little more may be using screenshots of successful test cases

problem yes the team did add test cases to test their changes but the overall test coverage has decreased 
problem yes the team did add test cases to test their changes and their overall test coverage has increased
problem yes the team did add test cases and the coverage increased too but the team didn t put any efforts after the initial review round since the failed tests are still failed and there are no new commits since 12 days
problem yes the team added visual aids like uml diagrams screen shots code snippets to clearly describe the changes to be made to the system well done
problem yes the system works fine and authors have fixed the problems found in the first round for an instance admin functionality and interest functionality were not present in round one but authors have implemented them now  
problem yes the system handles all the entity relationships well there is no mapping table as such but all relationships has been addressed in correct association degree in the application
problem yes the pull request did pass the travis ci it didn t has any conflicts with the base branch but it did have some unresolved issues which needed to be fixed namely cognitive complexity was 6 and condition size for two files were too high

problem yes the proposed solutions part clearly stated that they will go through each review to compare the new review score etc and then they will store the review url however the solution is not concrete enough and is a little bit hard to follow it should be great if there s more details in stating about how to loop through each reviews

problem yes the project is to do 2 things 1 stop teams from dropping assignments very late close to deadline 2 have different deadlines when assignments are done at different periods the wiki should be created on expertiza page and not on wikipedia site
problem yes the login signup module seems to be very well tested considering the fact that all the three types of users admins househunters and realtors are managed by using the same table but there s also a small functional bug even if i hadn t regisitered as a househunter or a realtor i am able to switch back and forth between the roles which is kind of counter intuitive in many ways
problem yes the github api integration looks good the only part missing was perhaps they could have documented the rest calls that they are going to make in the document as well usage of existing gems is good and eases lot of implementation pains

problem yes the design proposed by the author seem sound enough however the author has only given a high level view of the proposed design the author should delve deeper into the concept more while describing the intended design
problem yes the design is the simplest i could think about but it doesn t include how to change the files   i think it can still be as simple and succinct if the modifications of files can be included on the other hand the expected result seems to be too long there s too many screenshots

problem yes the design is sound and clear majority of the work is done by the suggestion algorithm the team proposes to integrate this functionality into expertiza and also improve the response time this project does not need to incorporate any design pattern as only the view files are altered the project does not impact the degree to which it is object oriented
problem yes the design is simplified and also there is room for some thought that is explicitly stated such as not really following the dry principle and the team is willing to work towards it which is really good
problem yes the design is simple the design includes details in checking rounds when it s bigger than or equal to 2 add the checkbox and otherwise do nothing however i doubt if that s needed in design document since in the future if we need to do 3 round reviews this 2 feature can be misleading
problem yes the design is quite simple
problem yes the design is as simple as it can get understanding the principle is not hard but making it simple should also not make it costly good work to the team if the instructors were looking for something this simple
problem yes the design is as simple as it can be the current scenario is explained with adequate screenshots and the changes are explained  by stating the field to be used for sorting the table a mock up screen of the expected output would have made it even better to understand however reading the material is sufficient as well the changes are not complex as they interact with a single view at a time the tablesorter function is also called for each view e g view_submissions layout

problem yes the design appears to be sound there could be some rearrangement in the mock up layout e g text box for email address and add button could have the same horizontal alignment for a better user interface
problem yes the database design and flowchart gives a clear picture what system will do after the required changes suggestion add before after changes screen mock ups to your document
problem yes the code was written well but a lot of functionalities  related  to the session was not added
problem yes the code seems good to deploy if we consider the manual testing and the video demonstration but since it didn t pass travis ci this claims seems a bit of a concern if we ignore the fact that lines of code was 500 and thats why travis ci failed but still there are a few lingering issues which the travis ci pointed which still hasn t been fixed it seems more of a patch which would require more patches to patch in the future

problem yes the code is written really well
problem yes the code has been refactored to cover all the intended scenarios and the tests have been very well documented along with testing the edge cases as said from their videos their  rspec however  doesn t seem to test many test cases but  that s expected i guess given their problem statement  
problem yes the code did pass travis ci successfully but as mentioned earlier the code did fail on 7 grounds of low severity this should have been fixed by the team as the issues were very small and required just minimal follow up

problem yes the code change along with the screenshots does explain the ordeal but the git screenshots and some more explanation would be well appreciated
problem yes the code already followed all the good conventions earlier except the lack of proper comments the code still lacks comments and the author hasn t made any changes since the last review but the overall code quality is upto the mark

problem yes the build passes travis ci no it did not had any conflicts there was only one message which was a warning but apart from that it everything seemed perfect
problem yes the authors have specified the changes that have already been implemented as a part of the oss project and the proposed set of changes that are to be implemented as a part of the final project detailed information on the changes already made is available as a wiki link to the previous document this document clearly captures the implementation of the offscreencanvas webidl and rust files the design document attached in this round encompasses the proposed design of implementation of the offscreencanvasrenderingcontext2d and enabling of the blob api for testing the code the authors have also listed the files changed and to be changed making it easier for the reviewers to keep track of the code on github though the text is lucid lack of a visual tool like flow charts tables or uml diagrams to concisely illustrate the workflow might make it difficult for new readers to follow the functionalities proposed and the interlinking of various modules so one suggestion at this point is that the authors could have included a visual representation of the design apart from that the document is well made and credits to the team
problem yes the authors have nicely explained the changes to be made this includes the flow diagrams uml diagrams and many of the screenshots good work team suggestion could include screenshots if any of the test plans implemented

problem yes the authors have improved the code the team has worked on the issue which i mentioned in the previous review the code doesn t seems to be confusing now but it still needs proper commenting to be done  
problem yes the authors are using already existing gems for the implementation i would have liked to see a section on caching if any   rest the solution proposed looks simple and straightforward and looks that it will easily integrate into the current system

problem yes team has added the test case
problem yes since the issues are fixed as required i think that the project can be merged to the production server however there is some work on the conflicts upon resolution of which the fixes can be included to the code i don t think that there is a need to take another approach for solving the issues
problem yes seems to be so the case in effect the last commit being just 5 hrs ago but what changes against each file have been made is not clear hence its a bit unclear as to the extent and the number of changes made moreover the amount of subject matter and the number of sessions or models are far too less to be implementing any changes as such

problem yes on manual testing it leads to realization that the code has been suitably written as required by the functionalities and also the doc they have provided is the results that i get on following the procedure although i would suggest that they look more into the test case 3 because how to go about testing it hasn t been explained by them

problem yes new code has been committed in the 2nd round the team has essentially implemented the offscreencanvas rs and offscreenrenderingcontext2d rs offscreencanvas rs is respondible for implementing the offscreencanvas webidl this interacts directly with javascript and when a new instance of offscreencanvas is created it calls the constructor with arguments height and width which in turn calls the new method defined in this file it also contains the reflector object that tells the javascript garbage collector to ignore the canvas object while clearing memory additionally it has the implementation of the getcontext method that returns a weak reference to offscreencanvasrenderingcontext2d which is responsible for doing background rendering task offscreenrenderingcontext2d rs has the implementation of offscreencanvasrenderingcontext2d it does not interact directly with javascript so it does not have the constructor or reflector the functionality to build an offscreencanvas object has been implemented in this file  
problem yes looks clean any design patterns used
problem yes it works as intended it would be better if you could add a video recording of the flow screenshots of the flow in the test plan  
problem yes it simple but some parts are not easy to understand

problem yes it simple but some parts are not easy to understand
problem yes it seems very sound they list what they are going to do in 4 fields
problem yes it seems like sound however the authors could add some principles and patterns into it
problem yes it has the implementation plan of a checkbox which allows the instructor to decide about review times since that is the only thing to be implemented there s no more issues i think the diagram doesn t have very pretty look it should be better if the screenshot can be smaller so that the fonts in the diagrams can be seen more clearly
problem yes it does explain but could have added more details to make it clear  
problem yes it does explain but could have added more details to make it clear  
problem yes in my opinion the team has understood the topic well and clearly listed all the functionality as described in the design document good job
problem yes i was able to understand the issue as well as the solution overall but i couldn t understand why there is a need to append a team name to an assignment it was just mentioned that it is done in other part of the code as well mentioning that would have given me a better idea

problem yes everything that the project required to do works there were a few things which caused issues in the pull request but none of it related to the functionality of the product to be tested but rather related to the code complexity even the video demonstration clearly shows the changes implemented
problem yes even constraints were defined well
problem yes design shows a good amount of work to be done team is not using any design pattern  
problem yes design seems fit more insight required on the algorithm itself and how it will be implemented

problem yes but i find a small bug the admin can edit his profile and select change his role to realtor although his role did not change there is no error report
problem yes both the the issues seem to be fixed from the screencast video it clearly explains the before and after scenarios and the system works as expected   the test plan is still missing for the fixed issues
problem yes as per the solution provided it does seem that the design incorporates the required functionality it considers sorting on all the specified fields suggestions since you have mentioned the use of jquery tablesorte you may also add explanation as to what is tablesorter and try explaining atleast for one field e g name as to how does it work to sort the entries    
problem yes as its sorting not much scope on design approach yet the team has documented well on their approach regarding multi level sortings that they are undertaking in few pages they have also considered cross browser compatibility of their jquery library which is a common design miss during client side changes
problem yes apart from the 7 issues of minor severity from codeclimate the code is perfectly well to integrate with the project no the project need not be planned and executed from scratch it is implemented well enough
problem yes and at times much more than necessary  
problem yes almost everything seems perfect only a little more explaination is required
problem yes almost everything seems perfect only a little more explaination is required
problem yes all the functionalities including viewing submission viewing scores viewing review report author feedback report teammate review report are all available i believe a more intuitive detailed explanation or description might be even more useful while describing the functionalities in the design here such design is still just simply stated as the project goal

problem yes a good test plan is also included
problem yes a fairly good job in that regard they have first explained their test plans then even provided links to their rspec tests which i checked then they have run and shown their screenshots of the rspec tests going through successfully even so their  coverage seems to be an  issue since it  hasn t been updates since the last submission that was 19 days ago as per their pull request which  even shows a  decrease in their coverage  
problem yes visual aid has been provided in the form of flow charts and screen shots uml could added
problem yes very well written i would have given full marks if you would have added code snippet and screenshot of the before and after feature visually it would have been great to understand the changes quickly

problem yes the ui is pretty smooth and a person can navigate freely however in some cases there is no back link in the web page so the user has to use browser navigation to go to the previous page
problem yes the ui is interactive and easy to use
problem yes the test plan is included but the test plan appears to be very shallow as it gives the which functionalities must be test but doesn t mentions it inform of test like what should be the actions taken when a certain condition arises it can be more clearly stated by mentioning the test cases in form of context and it statements

problem yes the team has added tests i am not sure of the increase in coverage as it is not mentioned in the doc however the team has very well explained how the tests were done and what areas they have tested
problem yes the team has added test for the utf encoding acceptance the coverage is not 100 and not tested with varied inputs but i believe would suffice for sanity check although the description of test in rspec file is ambiguous not clearly mentioning what exactly the test is expected to do there is no test available for the issue 2 documented
problem yes the team did add test cases but i am surprised on why the coverage numbers have fallen so much this needs some investigation   i think good test cases were added as part of the work i would have though liked to see more ve test cases checking for the failure conditions

problem yes the relationships are handled properly 1 company multiple realtors etc no mapping table as such the schema handles it
problem yes the project is complete and sound enough in its approach and the implementations and the test plan has been well devised and just shy of application  
problem yes the project is a test project for menu rb the code coverage has increased to 100 though the code covers all lines i feel edge cases are not covered well  
problem yes the problem statement and design approach sections explain clearly what the usecase is and what the authors think will be a good design to implement the changes are clearly explained having some file names would be useful to review in detail
problem yes the presence of use case diagrams and flow charts explaining the work flow is good it would be nice if there were more uml diagrams such as sequence so show various class interactions   presence of mockup screens is good that helps in understanding what is being implemented it would have been good if the authors put in more details about the validations that that propose in the system

problem yes the features work as described in the problem statement the team has done good job and has fixed all the below issues issue 971 change create topic ui into ajax issue 926 we need a way to sort topics by topic number in assignment edit page issue 718 we should allow instructors to give feedback when accepting or rejecting topic suggestions
problem yes the documentation looks complete  and states the project purpose and solution are stated the project design could be described in more detail
problem yes the document mainly talks about small changes at different places in the application that are being done i think more implementation details with ample justification are missing if the team is using certain apis why are they using should have been mentioned    
problem yes the design looks simple the use of mock up screens is good and greatly helps understand the flow that has been proposed good work how ever in one of the flow charts the check for is admin does not show label  y or n path

problem yes the design is sound and appeopriate however it may be better to implement more code level design
problem yes the design is pretty good the patterns followed avoids any duplication of code but i had made a suggestion in review one to take a look at project 1843 and it s code the problem statement is quite similar and the code could be reused i don t see any mention of it i hope you do take a look before starting to code as it will avoid any re work

problem yes screen shots are helpful but the document missing flow control diagrams 
problem yes partially the code has the parameters not well defined for all only one  conceivable  user seemingly admin and that too is doubtful to have the correct mvc layout   for instance they seem to have created separate mvc architectures for admins companies and users only this goes to show that they are lacking in a layered approach on access and privileges   also the code is written in a reasonably clean and formatted style with the variable definitions to be self explanatory of the functionalities they perform in most cases for whichever few roles defined

problem yes it states the plan design well testing can be better represented in terms of whether its ui testing or automated tests etc
problem yes it explains with clarity the issue at hand utf 8 only support how that causes trouble also improper formatting of html tags
problem yes good write up but would have like to see details on model   in test plan lines like   two test cases for method are redundant can should remove them

problem yes design appears to be sound also the flow diagram helps us understand it better team did not use any design pattern  
problem yes commits are done to fix the code climate issues
problem yes authors have done well to explain the changes being done in the project i think i wish they would have added is the details of languages they are supporting     also they do mention that they will add extra column to languages table they could have pasted the new schema in the doc

problem yeah the build has passed the travis ci test and there were no conflicts found on the pull request
problem yeah i believe it is as simple as possible while choosing the best path for the expertiza project to grow but it still sounds like a very ambitious project for 1 group to complete
problem y all did the least possible work and put it on wikipedia instead of the expertiza wiki

problem write up isn t provided i went through their git commit and the requirement for  issue 1201 there is a puts statement in the controller i feel that should be removed you guys might have added it for debugging purposes but it should be removed before committing also not sure how the changes made are applicable to the problem at hand which is to check if assignments have the same name if i m not wrong
problem write up isn t good they have just added there code in the write up without explaining anything plus no comments in code code snippets in writeup are going off the page
problem write up is written well and it is understandable images are not in proportion and not of same size and hence wiki page does not look steady team can work on image size and image description and manual test plan in more detail

problem when house is deleted the inquires and replies are deleted as well this has been handled error page occurs when i try to sign up for the same role with the same email error in deleting a user if the user has submitted an inquiry reply house hunter can add a house to interest list multiple times should not be allowed by maybe hiding the button if the house is already in the current user s interest list readme md does not cover how the system handles edge cases
problem when delete a user with inquiry data the system crush and return an error
problem when an admin deletes a real estate company which has realtors and houses the company gets is getting deleted along with the realtors which is not the expected functionality because realtors can exist even without being a part of a company the realtor should not get deleted from the database could not test whether the inquiries are deleted if the house hunter is deleted because the admin is unable to delete a house hunter from the users list
problem when admin try to delete a user the website return some error when the admin try  to delete a real estate company it just redirect to the edit route instead of delete the company 
problem when admin deletes a company associated with a realtor it gets reflected in the realtors profile his company name shows nothing and the houses listed were also deleted admin is not able to view house hunters profile error in deployment but can view the same using users section when a user is deleted by admin his inquiries are removed and he is no more a potential buyer too when realtor changes creates new company his previous company houses are deleted this is reflected in the admin table too realtor is not able to view houses listed by others   edge cases a company can be created without filling in the fields required yes an empty row is displayed to the hunter when a company is created without any detail but it displays the company number row number while seeing the houses so a house is shown for a company that doesnt exist in the view companies page session control when user signs out from a page and then goes back the profile page should not be shown as he is signed out this should be considered
problem when a real estate company is deleted the respective houses are deleted the realtors are not further even after deletion the company of those realtors remains the same they can even edit the deleted company from their profile and list a house on behalf of the deleted company when a realtor edits and updates his company after it is deleted it actually gets created again when a realtor changes his company he can view only the houses of his current company and is prohibited to delete houses of his previous company this works as expected when a house hunter is deleted s he gets removed from the potential buyers list but inquiries are only partially deleted as in the row is still there but only two columns show data      
problem when a company is deleted by the admin the realtor s profile belonging to that company crashes
problem what will happen if the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses app crashes what will happen if admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries app crashes

problem what and how explained well but they explain the why behind their actions a bit more
problem well we can say that they have indeed tested the models they have defined in their readme file on github the definitions of the functionalities in the db folders and the controllers folder makes it very easy to follow how they have structured the code also the way the houses are added the redirection the houses to the links such as cmu and ncsu websites is very intuitive and well thought out and thus barring out a few minor mistakes in linking and page definitions the code has a good ability to run for the defined cases specially for the admin to be failsafe only one complaint though the whole structure does crumble when one sees that they have allowed the admin to be deleted this is their biggest loophole  
problem well not much information has been given on the wiki page though they have put some uml flow diagrams which give us an idea of the flow

problem well structured code using mvc pattern   couldn t find admin credentials mentioned on readme  
problem well done most of the functionality i commented on last time has been fixed with very intuitive ui the only thing i couldn t find still was being able to view all inquiries as an admin very good updates overall
problem well done work except the lack of search  the readme file and the ui is not so good  anyway it s a good work  
problem watching the videos i feel it is ready but no deployment link
problem was unable to test the work from ui but the implementation looks okay i would have liked some screen hots of mails and videos to be uploaded as references so that reviewers could look at them as well

problem upon manually testing the author s work it is noticed that the functionalities have not been implemented to the full the team did perform migration of the crud functionality for the questionnaires from questionnairescontroller and removed large patches of if case statements by placing it in the helper function in the apt model this however has reduced their coverage
problem unsure in this regard since they neither have the deployment neither the github link to their repository and also the coverage and the travis ci say otherwise even so in their video they show in proof that everything runs one does wonder though how to test without actually having the links of the repo

problem these are my views on their writeup 1   certain sections are too bold i find that to be distracting 2   i like the way that they highlighted the lines of code that they have edited modified it made it easier to understand their work 3 it was also good that they included references section at the end it was something that i haven t seen in the other projects i have reviewed so far
problem there s still some minor style issues in the code regarding unnecessary parenthesis
problem there s only one diagram from the perspective of the user in terms of how the functionality should be like it does clearly describe the changes to be made to the system it should be better if there s another diagram which explains the work flow in terms of which files we need to do at each step and what we need to do one step after another to implement the project  
problem there s not really a rationale for why these particular tests are sufficient

problem there s no way to actually test this but from the code i don t believe that any of the edge cases would do anything
problem there s no visual aids   i think other than a screenshot of a finalized result possible a workflow diagram will also be useful the work design
problem there s no upload for the local folder it seems that no new pull requests has been committed during the 2nd round so i would guess no new code being committed for the 2nd round

problem there s a test  plan the test plan is deep and indeed tests the functionality it should be better if the test plan also includes another step between 4 and 5 in terms of how to make the step student can or cannot do the second review without the first one
problem there s a flow chart about how the end result look like but the flow chart only tells a user story there s no detailed implementation plan in this flow chart 3     some diagrams are too high level design and do not provide enough details applies here
problem there were some issues which i reported regarding comments and notice messages displayed to user which needs to be improved but they haven t been incorporated it is not a blocker but definitely an important change to improve user experience and better code readability for example in submitted_content controller there is a comment which says sending email to users however it is just a method call which redirects it to delayed_mailer rb so this should be properly mentioned as it will be helpful for someone refactoring or understanding the code later
problem there were some build issues raised by travis ci which have not been handled yet however there are no merge conflicts with the master branch
problem there were not any bad naming in round 1 as well comments could have been added for new additions which is still missing there has been no dry issues

problem there were mock ups of the final result of the project however there were no uml diagrams i think the uml diagrams are not necessary for this project since the flow of how the instructor will change the language is fairly simple and one can understand it by just reading the document maybe they could have done a mock up of how some of the other views would have looked like once the language has changed especially the pages with flash messages if any currently they have just shown the proposed changes on the page where the instructor will change the language
problem there were mock ups of how the analyze button would be displayed along side each rubric however there is no mock up for how the response would be displayed suggestions i would like to see where and how would that response be displayed because from the flow diagram the response seems to be quite big i would like to also know if the team is planing to display all the components of the response from the api or just a few

problem there was no functionality implemented during 1st review so there is a drastic improvement however there are some functionalities which need further improvements 1 admin has no option to post or view houses 2 admin is not able submit inquiry or reply to inquiries 3 admin has no option currently to edit his profile he should be able to edit his name 4 multiple realtors and house hunters can be created with the same email id there is no email or role validation this will allow a lot of duplicate entries and the app will also be suseptible to attacks by robots can be improved by a 2 line validation code in model 5 password should be encrypted while entering the details too it should not be displayed as plain text can be improved by simply using type as password instead of text  in views and applying encryption in model so that password is encrypted throughout the application6 search house functionality does not work when a new house is created it shows the same old results 7 also the description specifies search by price range but it has only one field to input price this won t work if the user wants to see a house which is between 1000 to 3000 bucks or any house which is less then 3000 bucks since the app shows only houses greater then the price entered 8 realtor is able to create a house even if he is not associated with a company 9 realtor is able to view potential buyers and reply to inquiries for all houses without being associated to a company there should be a check to ensure that realtor is able to post a house only if he is associated with a company also the option to view potential buyers and reply to inquiries should only be enabled for houses which are associated with his company in case of no company association he should be promted to associate himself with a company or create a new company first

problem there isnt any commit after the first submission
problem there is some repetition of code but overall code quality is ok there are some comments from the professor which should have been addressed  
problem there is some explanation about the general idea of what needs to be added to implement the new functionality however there are several sections missing that give light to the details of implementation and how this is tested to ensure correctness adding a description of where and how this new model will be developed with the existing image would  be beneficial for a thorough understanding of the reader this could also be achieved by rearranging the logic of the sections as sum sections elude to purpose and intent of implementation

problem there is a change in the colour code required so there was not much of a naming convention to be followed here dint find any instances in the attached code where name could be changed one instance of  is_submitted could be changed to  is_submitted
problem there have been some screenshots however i feel like some more details and diagram could have been added in this section
problem there have been only two commits one on 30th oct and second on 31st october there have been no commits since it would have been better if you people had given one more commit resolving the issues given by code climate since most of them are trivial

problem there have been no new commits since the last round of submission there seems to be some work pending since the last round for integrating the branch
problem there have been no additions to test cases although they have added a test case in last round   the test coverage has significantly gone down by 39 4 after their code changes
problem there has not been any changes after first round in the writeup so my opinion remains the same as it was in the previous review
problem there has been test failures but not related to the project
problem there has been some improvement in the content of the write up but not all suggestions have been incorporated adding more screenshots of the functionality or a video of the project being explained will always be helpful

problem there has been only one commit for the entire project
problem there has been few code climate issues reported but few of travis tests has failed mot all changes has been verified successfully
problem there has been a significant improvement in the level of details provided the author can further improve the document by providing the details of the design pattern to be used
problem there does not seem any issues with the code the team has properly used the naming convention and has provided comments wherever necessary
problem there could have been other tests with different inputs tried on the setup initialize and select methods the pre conditions could have been more eloborate
problem there could have been certain negative scenarios tested as well

problem there can be a few changes incorporated to the code especially the name mismatch of the web idl and corresponding rust file needs to be fixed the unnecessary comments have to be removed moreover the pull request shows that there are a few changes that have been requested and all checks have failed so the code can be merged and deployed only after these are incorporated

problem there aren t many visual aids used it may be a good idea to do some mockups for this project
problem there aren t any test cases listed in the writeup can explain the test cases a bit in the github commit message
problem there are two git links given not sure which one to review so reviewing the one which has more commits major functionalities are not implemented so cannot  comment on this namings are properly  given as per the rails standard
problem there are still session variables and route names being displayed on some of the screens which were suggested to be removed the functionality is quite good considering there was no implementation during first review potential buyers functionality is not implemented enquiry functionality doesn t work it throws application error check logs error when clicked possibly a deployment issue when  a new house is created it is not displayed in the listings immediately admin login doesn t work it may be possible that someone might have edited admin login during review or else please paste the latest login details in readme

problem there are some style issues related to spacing and unnecessary parenthesis  
problem there are some small problems like final  newline missing but overall looks good
problem there are some repetitions in the code which can be avoided by creating a helper function and calling that function from each place but apart from that code is well thought out and implemented nicely
problem there are some really great controller tests included in this application most of the functions in each controller are tested to ensure that they are returning and routing to the appropriate pages unfortunately there are no model tests implemented model tests should be written to test that the appropriate attributes and relationships of each model are implemented successfully it will prove extremely helpful in the improved functionality of your application make your model tests look like the controller test and you will be doing great  
problem there  are some instances of variable names that are concatenated with numbers for example answer2 questionnaire2 etc while this approach can be justified in some cases i would suggest using more descriptive names instead or arrays if multiple instances are required for example team could be used instead of team1 because that is the only team instance variable in the source code

problem there are some indentation issues but otherwise the code has method names in line with convention over configuration and the spacing and line spacing are reasonable also ids should not be on the ui the house hunters and realtors should not have to sign in after signing up

problem there are some duplicate codes could substitute with before statement for example line 100 are exactly the same with line 108 it is better to use before even if there is only one line duplicate

problem there are several improvements over the last review dropdowns have been implemented which make a huge improvement to the ease of use of the system     while the ui has become a lot better there are several  flaws   admin is shown to be registered as a realtor but cannot be redirected to the  pages househunter link works househunter can set another hunter s interest liist  by manipulating id   househunter can edit companies admin cannot destroy users   admin can not create edit destroy a realtor error page is shown realtor can list houses even if not enrolled in a company admin can not destroy househunter passwords are visible to admin   there are a few minor problems which if dealt with would make code even better   proper error messgaes while signing up with wrong password length a heroku  error shows up which makes it feel like the functionality isn t working whereas the problem can be user s fault as they  could have entered only 4 digit pin let users know that they need to provide proper input   also please do not ask passwords in a text field a very simple change can go a long way
problem there are quite a lot of commits meaning that the team could have grouped some of the changes together into one commit instead of commiting every small modification to make them more meaningful
problem there are project purpose and design but no testing plan is included

problem the writeup starts off by introducing servo mozilla s experimental high performance browser engine and rust which is a systems programming language with memory safety and concurrency used to build servo it then moves over to web audio api for handling audio operations inside audio context and allow modular routing and a workflow for implementing web audio was clearly listed it then flows into the scope of the project and the implementation the graphical and mathematical representation of the sine square sawtooth and triangle waveform gave a solid conceptual foundation the code snippet of the changes done in oscillator_node rs and the new file oscillator rs created by the team has also been included the section build that explains the procedure to install dependencies rust step by step procedure for building and running the build was very useful to explore the project the team had included the build instructions for windows and debian based linux they could have augmented the build instructions for mac os x which might save mac users from reading verbose instructions on the official documentation and instead refer to a single source the wiki the authors end the wiki by providing the test plan with examples of generated sine square sawtooth and triangle waveforms as audio files pull request and references

problem the writeup gives an easy understanding introduction of the two classes the team needed to test also there is detailed test plan is provided the wiki also shows how the test cases are designed and the results however for the motivation part it is a little bit general which needs to add more things specific for this project
problem the writeup gives a high level overview of the work done suggestion 1 you can try to make the write up more illustrative by discussing which refactoring principles were implemented in which files and how does it make a difference 2 you can take help of code snippets to make it more understandable

problem the writeup does bot explain how and why the authors did the work the way they did
problem the writeup clearly explains the project a single rejoinder per team for reviews but does not explicitly say the advantages of having such a system on the other hand the authors do justify the need to fix navigation issues for giving feedback to reviewers as it results in a user friendly ui the modification to summary report to accommodate collective feedback is logical and directly implied if the main problem statement of single rejoinder per team is properly justified
problem the writeup clearly explains the implementation details and why those changes were made it is nicely articulated and leaves no ambiguity
problem the writeup clearly explained the need for the off screen canvas api however the explanation of how the feature was implemented was too shallow what is in those rs files

problem the write up is very self explanatory it successfully covers each and every aspect of the work done by the team and also to an extend delvers what mindset they had while working o the project which is very great just one sugestion is that instead of simply dumping the files they could have made a quick note of what the code in the file does no one want to go through each and every line of code just to get an idea what it is meant to be

problem the write up is good but it doesn t feel much refined or improvised after the initial edit as mentioned above the image isn t visible clearly which means that it wasn t reviewed much after posting but apart frm that the flow of the write up is very effective in fact one of the best that i ve reviewed the concept of giving a higher lvel view and then diving deeper into the implementation is very subtly applied

problem the write up gave a good introduction to the project by providing the background information about the servo parallel web engine project by mozilla for web page rendering and rust programming language to execute html5 and css3 parsers it then highlighted the offscreencanvas api that can be used to generate frames and also return the rendered image using the transfertoimagebitmap method the writeup covered how web workers can be used to implement offscreencanvas api to render images as an independent process isolated from the webpage the problem statement of of creating  offscreencanvas and offscreencanvasrenderingcontext2d interfaces with  offscreencanvas constructor properties  width and height and getcontext method was defined the use of web idl to describe interfaces for web browsers was briefed and that was followed by the code flow and the code snippet of the two web idl files namely offscreencanvas webidl and offscreencanvasrenderingcontext2d webidl while the write up was cogent and clearly explained the work done it could have elaborated on the implementation of the methods like transfertoimagebitmap and how the interface is integrated into the system to render images in a webpage using an isolated web worker
problem the write up does not include a test plan section if a test section had been included then the different scenarios pre conditions edge cases and invalid input values would have been dealt
problem the write up did cover about the efficiency of servo to render webpages quickly and smoothly when compared to mozilla s other rendering engines servo does this using  parallel layout styling web renders and constellation and in turn sandboxes the processes   threads and tasks that allows the browser to fail better hence making it more robust and secure   it justified the use of rust to rewrite c and effectively the browser as well

problem the write up starts with introduction about expertiza test driven development and unit testing it then moves over to describing the problem statement team members test plan and implementation that contains detailed documentation on the procedure to set up the expertiza environment functionalities of menu model sample views declaration of mock objects as test entries and finally the conditions tested on each of the method of the node and menu class the various methods tested on the node class include initialize setup site_controller controller_action content_page and add_child similarly the methods tested on the menu class include initialize select get_item get_menu selected selected and crumbs   the write up also includes the screenshot of the rspec tests that were run the screenshot of the simplecov coverage report is blurred and not readable   the write up ends with concluding remarks learning outcomes and references overall the documentation was very precise and clear with all the information needed to understand the code on github the authors could have included and highlighted how to run the rspec code since their project specifically deals with unit testing another apparent issue that i can point out is the quality of screenshot
problem the write up is written adequately only thing is to reduce the code shown on the wiki page as i feel that it might be irrelevant to have the whole code increasing the reading page size

problem the write up is well documented there is a clear flow from the code change part to the screenshots of the implementation it would have been better if there was a screenshot of the code from git or a link to git so that the code changes would have been more defined as per the green and red colour also the code change could be explained more
problem the write up is very well detailed with good information and pictures two things 1 put the write up on the expertiza wiki page instead of in a word document 2 on the wiki use the   tag to insert code snippets into the page instead of a screenshot of the code
problem the write up is simple and understandable it starts off by describing about expertiza motivation behind the project the tasks to do list of classes that are modified and impacted by the change i like how the authors have screenshots of both the existing code that is removed and the new code that is added in the pull request which juxtaposes them and highlights the tasks in the problem statement and goals of the project the write up then ends with the test plan which lists the test cases handled
problem the write up is short and to the point it could have been formatted and arranged in a better way

problem the write has only details of team members and files changed out of the two files mentioned only one is currently committed in git vm_question_response rb is missing may be a commit issue
problem the wirteup is pretty good it gives the test plan and all the test cases also there is explanation of the test process and logic just one minor problem   the 29 tests provide 100 coverage of the lines in menu rb before the project the coverage was only it is an incomplete sentence
problem the wireframes themselves make the project self explanatory that being said enough explanation about how the team will tackle the problem statement has been given things like what api will be used to achieve the objective has been mentioned no suggestions
problem the wiki talk about what they have done throughly it could be better if they have mention about how they do that

problem the wiki should not include conclusion and learning outcomes part it is not a report of the project but a page to show what the project itself is
problem the wiki provides enough introductions for this project according to the wiki i can get a clear insight about what the project is what s the issues include in it why the team do things as the way they said and the tests they give to make sure the functions work properly however the description for the first issue is not very clear and makes me confusing

problem the wiki page is divided into some great sections that provide details about the project   i appreciate that the team provided actual code snipits along with explanation of the test to afford the reader a deeper understanding the first paragraph in the design section is a bit hard to follow it would be helpful to have this explanation accompanied by the tests these stubs were associated with and or the actual implementation of these stubs for a better grasp of their purpose i  would recommend combining the test and design sections for a easier flow of reading and following test implementations thank you for the results section of the wiki that wraps up the project and is an easy point of reference for the reader to see the outcome of the project  
problem the wiki looks too long with a lot of code it does have all the code and test cases but its better to have git links to each code and more explanation of the code used above it in the wiki this will help the readers to compare the changes in the code with the explanation parallelly

problem the wiki is great but i believe it s better to move the testing framework part to front of the page
problem the wiki is detailed enough that it mentions all the functionalities required in the project the team has made sure to  explain all the changes they wish to make to the system they list all columns that need to be sorted and how they will implement the sorting
problem the wiki is descriptive and covers the essentials of the project in my opinion i think the code for every test is not required it is enough to explain the structure and code for one test maybe and what each test is supposed to do for the rest of the tests that should suffice

problem the wiki explains the problem statement well and proposes relevant solution the team has done a great job on stating the design approach and has included diagrams for them however the team needs to add the testing plan for the project
problem the wiki explains the problem statement very well along with the proposed solution which seems reasonable but the wiki does not include any test plans as of now there are a few test cases which can be used to write the test plan for eg not adding drop deadline for the assignment itself and assigning each topic a drop deadline and check the behaviour of the system
problem the wiki does not include any discussions about design principles or patterns that were used in the project   one thing that stands out in the code is that every mock object is defined at the start of the file the team could provide a rationale for this decision and why it is superior to for example using different mocks for each separate test suite

problem the wiki defines the primary goal of the project but it does not contain a discussion about the plan or strategy that is utilized to solve the problem raw code is copied from review_response_map rb and review_response_map_spec rb files however this does not give the reader any useful information   i would suggest replacing the review_response_map rb code with a short description of what the team needed to understand about the given code in order to write the test suite furthermore the team can provide a listing of higher level method descriptions from review_response_map_spec rb what are the expectations and which mock objects are being used to achieve the result one minor improvement would be removing parts like expertiza description http wiki expertiza ncsu edu index php csc ece_517_fall_2018 e1850 _write_unit_tests_for_review_response_map rb background because it is redundant in this context

problem the wiki could have been organized better it looks a little messy not self explanatory the use case does not have any actors in it suggestion code screenshots could have been placed better
problem the wiki clearly defines the primary objective of the project and justifies the reasoning behind introduction of additional helper constructs like participant factory the authors complement the descriptions of each test case with associated block of code and elaborate on the details of  their inner workings i would suggest removing parts like high level descriptions of expertiza and unit tests http wiki expertiza ncsu edu index php oss_e1852 rb unit_test_description because they are redundant in this context
problem the whole wiki page is complete and neat while it might be easier to understand if they reorder the test plan with other parts of the page

problem the visualization aids used currently are application flow diagram and use cases they are useful to understand the scenario of the problem statement however a sequence or a communication diagram will really be beneficial to understand how the method interfaces with the other  methods this will help identify if the new method impacts other functionalities and will portray the proposed solution efficiently
problem the visualization aids used are class diagram for the strategy pattern use cases to explain the test plan the class diagram is very useful to illustrate the approach used by the team and it succeeds in explaining they have made changes according to the suggestion provided in the previous review a sequence diagram will help understand the flow of the methods from one controller to the other as the design suggests so

problem the user interface was working as described in the readme file   the ui functionality don t have any issues apart from the one noted in additional comments if team would have given some assets stylesheets config   the ui would have been great on the looks as well
problem the user interface looks pretty is clean and intuitive but the placement of menu buttons was rather not obvious it took time for me to figure out login signup buttons and i also had to actively look for buttons to perform actions after signing in which isn t actually much user friendly though it may seemed cliche but i think it is very user friendly to have action buttons on the content of the web page rather than having them at the top inside the header but apart from that the simplicity and the look and feel was pretty good
problem the user interface lack multiple navigation functionalities such as it does have any cancel or back button   so if a user tries to move back or cancel while creating a company he would be stuck and would not be able to move to any other tab
problem the user interface is very well designed and the cleanest and the most user friendly among all that i ve reviewed till now the ui is very intuitive and the alternate shading of the lists improves legibility a lot the only place where the ui was deficient was that it didn t seem consistent the login signup page had a different ui compared to other pages i suppose improving consistency would increase user friendliness of the application to a lot of extent  
problem the user interface is very simple clear and straightforward but it lacks depth where it should have been extensive for example after signing up for the first time the user is directed by to the login page to login again this is not very user friendly and is rather redundant one must automatically sign in after creating an account also the application should deduce whether i m a realtor or a househunter or an admin from the email id i entered i should atleast now have to specify for househunter or realtor about my role
problem the user interface is very pimitive the team could have done much more they have not designed it very well although i was not looking for graphics but the element placement could have been much more improved  
problem the user interface is very intuitive the idea to add a field for preferred contact is very smart and relevant displaying the number of registered users however seems irrelevant to the house hunter and realtor perhaps this can be a function of the admin account where it would be more relevant
problem the user interface is very intuitive i like the modern look and feel of the ui as well as the icons and images it s quite professional excellent work the various buttons are in good locations the button text could be darker however the new user link could be made into a bigger button which would make it more prominent right now it is hard to see
problem the user interface is very confusing it is difficult to get to the sign up page to begin with and then the messages isrealtor and ishousehunter are cryptic to actual users anyone other than computer scientists it is very difficult to follow where the links take you on the website and what exactly you are looking at at any given moment
problem the user interface is very appealing the show view is especially remarkable that makes good use of the attractive classes of css and bootstrap the navigation links provided in every page are very helpful to explore the website the switch user capability makes it easy for users to switch between roles without the hassle of logging out and logging in again one issue that i encountered was that the inquiries controller has not been fully implemented which lands the website into an error page  
problem the user interface is pretty intuitive few things like the create house functionality is breaking on heroku and giving an application error
problem the user interface is pretty intuitive few things like the create house functionality is breaking on heroku and giving an application error
problem the user interface is nice i suggest you move the search button in the houses screen to the left also yes and no would probably be more user friendly than true and false for the basement condition the new user window was very intuitive and powerful note i found a bug in this window changing the admin account with realtor checked causes an error the error screen was graceful however also please use radio buttons for hunter or realtor not checkboxes please also include the type of the user in the users window
problem the user interface is done as it would be in a basic ruby application which is good there is no login functionality this is mentioned in the readme which was helpful some functionalities which could be improved are 1         1   when i try to add a new house hunter from admin i get a contact method is not included in the list error as a user i don  t know what kind of values your system is expecting in this field so it might help to probably provide a dropdown selection element and put in your values there in this way the user will always select a value which your system is expecting if there are a finite number of values you can just hard code them into the html element else pick it up from the db and populate your dropdown as such 2           2 when i click on back from the new househunter url i am directed to show all house hunters url you could improve this by updating the link to for this back button by providing it with the user_url or you could detect which is the current user logged in realtor house hunter admin and accordingly redirect to that role  s home page url
problem the user interface is average   the good parts i found about ui are 1 error messages while registering a new admin house hunter realtor house company were helpful 2 front end checks like mail and phone number size and type etc have been used properly 3 dropdown for companies while registering houses for houses while submitting inquiruies  etc are properly implemented and easy to use however several very small changes would make the ui much better 1 allow a drop down  when signing up as roles 2 add inquire  a house or add a new house to interest list etc functionalituies  at the top if house list gets a few hundred rows long user must scroll all the way down to  access the functionalities 3 add message as  to why login failed something as simple as invalid credentials would suffice and let user know that the login is working but the password is incorrect

problem the user interface has a very basic look and feel the sign up links being on every page is not ideal there should only be a log out link also the company in the realtor page is showing the id not the company s name i suggest you use a drop down menu for the preferred contact of the house hunter who is signing up it would be much more intuitive to have a single sign in page for all users there were also missing back buttons

problem the user interface has a bare bones look and feel but is intuitive overall the inquiries list is hard to find for the admin and the links below the tables could be placed at the top of the screen to improve the ux the inquiry component of the app had awkward navigation particularly for the realtor this is also awkward for the house hunter only one link is needed up top

problem the use of active record is missing from the application there are no foreign key relationships in the schema although the relationship are maintained in the model file a separate database is created for admin realtor hunter which will store a lot of redundant data there is no database for storing the response of inquiries according to the db design a house belongs to both a company and a realtor directly which is not correct

problem the use case diagram appears to be slightly incorrect the symbol for an should be a stick figure not a rectangle but that is a minor error also the use case diagram details mention student as an actor but the diagram shows no instance of student as an actor i think the student as an actor shouldn t be included because in the current use case only the instructor is the primary actor and the assignment should have been submitted by the time the instructor views the scores thus requiring no involvement from the students at that point in time mention of primary sequence in the use case diagram details seems highly unnecessary and potentially unrelated

problem the topic assigned to this team is unit testing on menu rb so they had to create rspec tests for the methods in the model file menu rb in the new file spec models menu_spec rb the team has precisely tested the functionalities of every method including all relevant scenarios as contexts of both the nested class node and the enclosing class menu the names used for mock objects and literals are intuitive and follow the ruby s convention there were a few issues regarding incorrect indentation and the verbosity of the spec code in the previous round the team has rectified those in this round in my view giving additional comments for code in rspec is superfluous as the tests are already embedded with information on what it intends to do through the use of describe context and it methods   the code is dry through the use of reusable mock objects like menu nodes site controllers content pages controller actions items and roles which span across the entire block where it is defined additionally the use of before each method to initialize and set up these objects further dry s up the spec for the methods  
problem the tests were mentioned in the report but not in the pull request there was also no coverage information the approach looks good though

problem the tests given tests there changes which is enough
problem the tests for the controllers and models were basic scaffold tests with not much meaning
problem the tests describe the code they are testing not the behavior functionality like for in this scenario the controller_action attribute of the menu item is unavailable in this case the expectation is that a customized path  is assigned to the url variable this just specifies what  variable  is being updated and i have no idea what workflow it represents this is at least a brittle description for a test suppose tomorrow the variable is removed or some function ends up calculating the value while the test it self might pass if the change was passive the description is now stale and will confuse any user trying to update the tests

problem the testing of initialize is very well described with descriptions of how and why the tests were written in that particular fashion however all other tests are not discussed when looking at the github it seems that there were many more tests that were not elaborated upon the test descriptions were included at the bottom of the page but without explanation of implementation or purpose it would be helpful to include more of the test cases if anything it would be a good idea to discuss them without the code inclusion like that of initialize because that section of the wiki is very well presented

problem the team seems to have tested the login signup module pretty well i could hardly find any bugs there but the team seemed to have ignored testing other modules extensively this is because the delete functionality in many modules is not working for example the realtor cannot delete houses or company neither can a house hunter delete houses from his interest list
problem the team provides some test cases but it seems the tests were all done themselves and they didn t write codes for it and make it automatic the test shows the feature work properly
problem the team provided sufficient information on the project purpose and design the test plan is adequate     it would be better to provide a solid reasoning for incorporating different sorting few sorting implementations ie by name and team are intuitive but the need to sort the author feedback report and teammate review report in the way suggested by the team the reasoning is not very apparent need more problem statement elaboration

problem the team has made sure to write the relevant test cases wherever possible but the overall coverage has decreased in my opinion the newly added test cases cover  more or less the entire range of this project but i think that they need to focus a bit more on the test casses
problem the team has made great improvement as compared to the last submission the new code added has no bad names long or complicated functions but there is lack of comments the heading of the write up pages explains what the test case is doing but there should be proper commenting done in the code too
problem the team has leveraged the existing test cases to align with the changes implemented they have not created any test plan
problem the team has introduced the functions clearly but it may be better to also include the introduction of expertise itself besides the motivation is general add some specific details for this project would be better as far as i am concerned for the functionality of the menu the introduction is also a little bit general adding more details about what the function of the menu so we can know clearly what should be tested and if the test is enough

problem the team has included a thorough testing plan but i couldn t find any commits to any of the rspec testing controllers they could have added as per there test plan these tests could have been included 1 login as instructor4 add a new assignment assignment_instructor4 under the course course 617 spring 2016 2 make student6400 as the participant of that assignment and logout using capybara and cucumber
problem the team has included 2 screenshots of the review ui the first one depicts the existing look and the 2nd one shows that they plan to include a new button that is responsible for analyzing the segmented text corresponding to each rubric where the student has reviewed and also display a pop up message showing the results of suggestion metrics like  volume sentiment suggestion praise and criticism metrics   the team has also shown the user story in connextra format and also described to scenarios one happy path and one where no text is typed into the segmented text box input   the team could have made the document even more visually palatable with flow chars uml diagrams for use case or sequence diagram to support the feature and the scenarios they plan to implement

problem the team has improved the writeup since the 1st round the 1st round version consisted of the copied code from review_response_map rb and review_response_map_spec rb files this version clearly defines each test case and in some instances elaborates on the inner workings of the blocks for example import method discussion however design principles and patterns that were used in this project are still missing from the writeup   one thing that stands out in the code is that every mock object is defined at the start of the file the team could provide a rationale for this decision and why it is superior to for example using different mocks for each separate test suite

problem the team has implemented there testing plan and have been very thorough with there test cases they seem to have considered a lot of cases and have implemented them in rspec the only thing that they should do is use different commits for adding test cases
problem the team has implemented test for the user model and controller however it would make for better design if they used the rspec framework to do the test more comprehensive test cases could be tested such as if the passwords of the user don t match
problem the team has implemented proper functions and has used a proper naming convention however there is scope to add some comments for ex in the new method get_feedback_assessments_for method which will return a feedback assessment the team could have added some comments about the logic implemented apart from this the code is concise and good coding and ruby practices have been followed

problem the team has implemented automated tests there could be some addition to the test which i have suggested above
problem the team has heeded to the advice given in the last round and explained their tests in a more detailed manner i do feel that the write up is well written and covers almost all the important points of the project but i do feel images showing their tests running successfully could be added to the results part of the writeup
problem the team has has listed the 2 files that they propose to change namely   the view   app views response response html erb and the partial app views submitted_content _self_review html erb however they could have described what these files currently do and their purpose in the documentation the authors have embedded screenshots of how the ui of the review page will look after the analyze button will be included they have specified that a pop up showing the suggestion metrics pertaining to a review namely   volume sentiment suggestion praise and criticism metrics will be generated once the button is clicked

problem the team has given a design flow that underlines the basic way in which they are planning to target the issue at hand it can make use by giving an example as to how the output might look and the document must also describe the tools that would be used for achieving the task
problem the team has followed ruby coding standard however function names could be refactored for example the function get_time_diff_btw_due_date_and_now name is just too long and can be modified into get_time_diff or any other meaningful name also it is advisable to keep the function name singular or append the name with list so instead of using find_participant_emails the team can use find_participant_email_list
problem the team has followed good ruby coding practices all the code is neatly written and well indented however the code has no comments
problem the team has followed good coding practices with  sufficient priority on mvc model each model controller view has a specific role which has not been repeated in other parts of the code   i am giving 3 5 because 1 the code would have better readability if sufficient amount of comments are included in the code also if the role of each model controller view is documented in the code file at the beginning then other contributors may feel easy to follow the code 2 dry concept can be used to a better extent

problem the team has explicitly mentioned the classes and the name of the files where they have made changes however i would suggest the team to add the filenames above code snippets that they have attached in the write up this would make it easier for the reader to follow the workflow
problem the team has explained the problem statement well and detailed the implementation  they plan to do also the  appropriate test cases have been included but  i feel  the  team should have included more  explanation in their implementation
problem the team has explained the problem statement well  and has done job in explaining the flow for every user with diagrams for them however the team needs to add the design approach and the testing plan for the project
problem the team has explained the manual testing process suggestion include how the go functionality is actually tested in ruby include edge cases for the testing functionality

problem the team has done tremendous job in adding visualization aids they have added application flow diagrams and visualized images they have also included screenshots to explain the code functionality implementation of enabling self reviews and score pages this makes the document descriptive and very easy to read and understand    
problem the team has done great job by describing the approach and explaining same in detail by adding a pictorial representation of the pattern used   however it would be more helpful if the team could add details about the names of the classes and the exact code changes done in the wiki page as it would help anyone in future to understand what are the exact changes implemented in this way the comparing code with the original code in github can be avoided

problem the team has completed the missing code in the file oscillator_node rs which generates different wave forms like sine square sawtooth and triangle they then created the file oscillator rs that generates  objects and calls methods to run the different oscillator type examples the code in both these rust files have good comments that clearly explain what every snippet does and the significance of variables this made it easy to follow the syntax and semantics of a new programming language like rust rust is a systems programming language that focuses on memory safety and concurrency the variable names used are intuitive and the code is well indented one issue that i can point out here is that the code is lengthy and complex with a lot of redundancy especially those that define the audio context destination node oscillator and a few other local variables in the file oscillator rs are repeated for every oscillator waveform and can certainly be encapsulated in one function that can be called only once in the file

problem the team has committed changes during round 2 though the changes haven t been spaced evenly most of them are close to the deadline also the changes haven t even spaced evenly the names of the commits were descriptive
problem the team has committed changes after round one however there are less number of commits and are not spread throughout the life of the project a single commit is used for various functionalities which makes it difficult to understand the exact functionality changes the commit messages are not appropriate which makes it harder to find out what the fix is about there are commits even after the round 2 deadline
problem the team has clearly defined the objective of the project the have also stated the approach that they are about to use to solve the problem they have also clearly added the schema for storing the time information that the user will spend on a particular review the only thing the team could have added was to create a uml diagram defining the classes that are changed or added  and adding what attributes are added and what functions modified added the team haven t mentioned any design pattern as such but the proposed  plan explains the idea well

problem the team has a very well documented history of commits   the commit history seems to be well spaced over the entire period of the project development cycle the team has commits in each of the submission periods and have kept on adding functionalities and updating documentation the team could have updated their readme a little bit more and added information regarding all the functionalities being assigned to individual roles and how the user experience is set up also the team could have adde information on how to run tests in readme md file
problem the team has a proper concern on mvc model each model controller view has a specific role which has not been repeated in other parts of the code   still i am giving 3 5 because 1 the project has neglected dry principle in many of the instances   this has resulted in a bulkier code 2 as many authors  say a code looks good if it appears like reading a novel this appearance of a novel like look is missing in many places which can grab other user s attention 3 the code would have better readability if sufficient amount of comments are included in the code also if the role of each model controller view is documented in the code file at the beginning then other contributors may feel easy to follow the code
problem the team had not added a link to the wiki during round 1 of the review   issues to be fixed section seems incomplete and not the right kind of writing please review and try to add more details on the issues that are being addressed otherwise the wiki looks good with relevant diagrams and code snippets
problem the team had added test cases in the first round of submission itself the overall coverage has decreased by 1 04 the test covers the logic implemented by the students but reduces the overall coverage the team did a good work in using capybara and testing the web functionalities too  
problem the team gave fixtures for the issues exist but to make deployment it is better to add more tests to make sure the function work properly
problem the team gave clear explanation of what functions include in this project besides they gave some examples to help us to understand how the functions work and should work in the system so i can point out the issue easily by following their instruction
problem the team followed good practices no repetition of the code dry principles uses how there is an empty controller though which is the commons_controller rb what is its purpose

problem the team didn t no provide the link for the deployment but according to the video they provided the features worked well
problem the team did not seem to submit their changes throughout the project the team have made changes only after round 1 and nothing on round 1 there are a total of 19 commits it would have been better if the commits have been made with messages so that others can know what changes have been made in the project  
problem the team did not perform any changes from the first round no test cases were added and the coverage remained the same the test cases from the previous round considerably fulfill the range of the project
problem the team did not have a writeup in the last submission in this submission they do have a writeup with the problem statement the files modified approach to solving the problems and test plan this seems to be a significant improvement from the last submission as for the screencast links i think one link is absent and the other one is a youtube video of the same project submitted last year please check this i think you have added the wrong link i would also suggest that a references section needs to be added to the wiki page so that the deployment pull request and other project reference links are shown
problem the team did not commit their changes throughout the project period the changes were committed in round 2
problem the team did not attach the link for the github repo along with the other files submitted this makes it difficult to comment upon the commits made however from the video link it can be seen that the test cases have improved to give a full path coverage

problem the team did not add any test cases   the coverage did not increase as a result of that   suggestion unit test cases should have been written as a part of the final deliverable
problem the team did not add any test cases since they had achieved a 100 coverage in the first round itself however certain changes made to the test cases included using proper naming conventions for attributes and following the dry principle effectively throughout the model file
problem the team did change the project as there are 2 new commits the ci build is still failing
problem the team did a good job in explaining the problem statements for each issue and  providing their proposed solutions the purpose of the project is clear from the document as is a composite of several  independent issues the problem is that testing plan is missing from the project i would suggest starting from the most basic test cases that check the functionality e g one spec per issue and then elaborating from there moreover while  fixing some issues like  1008 and 1065 consists of a  small  modification to the existing code there are other cases where the design decisions are not  provided and it would be better for the team to include some justifications and possible discussions of design patterns the  document extensively uses diagrams that depict application flows for each use case which is impressive
problem the team could have added more test cases as they have mentioned about refactoring the code the refactored code and the screenshots of the test cases would have been better to display in the wiki for future students

problem the team added more information from the last time which aided in a better explanation of the problem good job team

problem the team added a test case however coveralls shows the following   overall coverage decreased 17 2 to  19 566 i interpreted this as as decrease in coverage  
problem the system works well all the functionality has been implemented i ran the project and it worked as intended the back button issue in ui has been fixed
problem the system works well in most of the cases except when the realtor creates his company and then after successfully creating the company he get s an option to edit his company details but then when he clicks the edit button it redirects to the homepage and is unable to edit his company info unless he choses to belong to the particular company a minor bug but still breaks the consistency
problem the system works well and performs all the operations correctly 1 for the aforementioned errors in code
problem the system works exactly how it is supposed to work i could not find any functionalities that are still failing no bugs or error messages it would have been better if the realtor could send replies to inquiries directly from the application than opening a separate mail application
problem the system works as intended however the flow for system given in the wiki is quite confusing the test cases were edited to cover all scenarios
problem the system works as expected and common functionality is working but still needs to focus on some areas 1 not able to sign in as admin with preconfigured account 2 how to add inquiries or to an interest list

problem the system properly handles the relationships where a real estate company can have multiple realtors also it supports a realtor to create multiple houses and the house hunters to add multiple houses to their interest list
problem the system performs all the desired functionalities a shoutout to the idea for the auto filled inquiries i really liked that feature where the inquiry is already filled after which the user gets an option to edit the inquiry some parts need improvement for ex the link new houses in the house list redirects to the  users edit link its a minor issue which could be looked upon the layout of the homepage for house hunter can be fixed as links overlap each other also the houses list shows edit destroy options for the entire house list that s a bug which needs fixing

problem the system operation is verified and works as intended as demonstrated from the video   also all the test scenarios are covered
problem the system operation from ui works as expected by the project i was able to verify that the rejoinder is given by the team instead of team member the rejoinder is also made easily available to the user by providing easy navigation options to give feedback to reviewers hence making the ui more user friendly the author feedback section contains the team s collective feedback to reviewers of particular assignments most of the task is to refactor code so that it complies with the new requirement of team rejoinders and the features work as expected
problem the system just works in few functions even though authors fix the problem that admin cannot log in in the first round   it  still lack many functions that the system supposed to have from the admin perspetive admin can edit show and delete any users create show edit and delete any companies but it cannot create a new user besides when i click the link of house the 404 page jump out which means that there is no way that i can see any houses listed from realtor s perspertive a realtor can sign up and log in apart from these there is no other fuction that realized in the system a realtor cannot switch his her role or edit his her profile cannot list houses choose company she he belongs to and reply any inquiries from hunters from the perspertive of hunter authors just realized the function of signup and sign in besides those it doesn t have any other functions that the system is supposed to have besides there are some problems in log in part when i  log out as admin and log in as a realtor or a hunter i can still access

problem the system is in great shape it is easily one of the best i have seen and they still didn t implement all of the expected functionality
problem the system has all the required functionality however it would also be useful if the readme file explained where some of the features are incorporated for instance the submit inquiry field is located on the show page for the houses this is not immediately intuitive it could help if that is mentioned in the readme
problem the system has all the basic functionalities as per the program description as per the last feedback validation checks for invalid data has been added to the application however the system still does not have the null checks for field   for example if a user creates a house without adding most of the details the application breaks   https housefocus herokuapp com houses
problem the system doesn t check all edge cases a realtor can see company listings even without choosing a company the readme does not outline exactly how all edge cases are handled
problem the system does not portray good database design first of all there are two separate tables for enquiries and reply to enquiries which is highly not normalised also the fact that there are 3 separate tables for the three types of users is also very in efficient and non scalable it does make an attempt to map the various relationships but it seems it is not properly tested and is prone to many bugs

problem the suggestions have not been improved comments aren t explanatory and does not give an idea about what the author intended to do it would be good to include meaningful comments debug code is still in the commit even though we may used debug code like the puts statement we should not commit these as they could create junk data in the application log please consider removing them
problem the  submission is about adding tests to the project  and authors have done a great job of adding 92 code coverage   i would have liked to see more ve test cases for example cases such as user with incorrect names as of now the test cases only checks of the user name is present or not how about the case where user name is such that it is not allowed user class throws an exception or add method can this could have been documented  
problem the structure of codes is not very good that is for a it statement there are two many things include in it to be tested it is better to separate   the test cases clearly besides the objects seem not store in factories properly
problem the stated design seems to be appropriate following a close representation of the current project bidding structure would prove successful it would have been beneficial to supply more details on how the design would be implemented and could help in the justification of the choices this team used
problem the source code is mostly written in a coherent way and is straightforward to follow   the context blocks are extensively used which increases the project documentation the commented chunks of code blocks that were present in the 1st round are mostly removed there are still a few instances left and i would suggest to remove them because they reduce the overall readability i would also suggest  to decompose  the it block inside the final_versions_from_reviewer by moving the common setup to a before each block and spreading the assertions across several it statements   another improvement would be to remove the xit code blocks because they only increase the clutter and do not add any value to the code adding one comment explaining why the blocks are no longer necessary would do the job

problem the source code is mostly following standard ruby practices but there is a room for improvement firstly the source contains large chunks of code blocks that are commented out i would suggest removing those chunks as they reduce the overall readability given chunks can always be  retrieved via commit history secondly some application level objects like answer or criterion are used to create corresponding instances as opposed to mocks it would be better if the authors either used mocks or provided the reasoning for this decision

problem the section is included by the content is empty simply listing steps in how you plan to test for correctness of your model additional would work here
problem the search properties and addition of potential buyers needed to be improved and fixed after the first round the authors fixed all of it for round 2 the system works exactly how it is supposed to work i could not find any functionalities that are still failing they have added additional features like signing up with google and sending replies to enquiries via email

problem the role switch option between realtor and househunter  is not present further the operation cannot be performed manually also as same mail id cannot be used for creating two accounts
problem the reuse of the questionaire class is smart to reduce duplication otherwise the minimal explanations make it hard to judge
problem the result of edge cases are 1 the admin cannot delete real companies with realtors and house hunters 2 the realtor can change real estate company they ill be prohibited though from viewing previous company listings 3 the house hunter account along with their inquiries are removed from the system 4 the realtor account links to a real estate company with 1 to n mapping

problem the readme file isn t as descriptive as it should be and ui is not very well designed printing hello world on the home page seems to be a debugging strategy but it needs to be removed and proper links needs to be inserted example link of logout is not present
problem the readme file is very helpful and facilitates usage of the application there are few issues which can still be resolved such as the navigation issue still persists for example if a house hunter wants to cancel the inquiry there is no way to do that the user would be toggling between the inquiry index page and the inquiry submit page the validations have still not been addressed for example an inquiry can be created without adding any details at all with all empty fields if the house hunter tries to switch to the realtor view the application breaks as below we re sorry but something went wrong   if you are the application owner check the logs for more information  
problem the readme file is still the default provided by rails i don t have access to an admin login and when i try to sign up for a new account realtor or hunter i get redirected to a webpage telling me that something went wrong the small ammount of the ui that does exist login and create account seems easy enough to understand but it appears that without logging in i cannot see any other links

problem the proposed refactoring changes seem to follow good ruby principles and also looks dry   they haven t mentioned any pattern as such but overall the design document looks neat and very well written
problem the proposed design seems reasonable before proceeding with the project team should also look at other references to those functions and do it accordingly

problem the project writeup explains very well the topics that it has covered however it has not covered many of the topics like implementation and even a test plan
problem the project works as mentioned in the file  
problem the project was not deployed the project should have been deployed however the video that the team uploaded shows the 2 functionalities that they have implemented and they work as intended suggestion one feature was not implemented 3rd issue and should have been done as a part of the deliverable and the project should have been deployed
problem the project seems to be incomplete the work done is also not properly mentioned in the writeup
problem the project purpose seems to be only a user story that says what s the deficiencies of te corrent  issues and a terse solution i wonder if that s comprehensive enough i would add some more details in terms of the purpose of each function being changed  in a lower level   there only a high level solution and which files to change  for the project design they are not detailed enough i would add some more plans in terms of how to make the change when to do the change if the changes are inter dependent there s no testing plans yet but i think that should be stated

problem the project purpose is well defined and clearly explains what this project aims to do the team also identifies the strategies they wish to adopt to fix the issue this explanation is clear and concise however i would also suggest the team to add a basic test plan on how they would test the functionality they add also i suggest them to list down the list of files they would be changing

problem the project purpose is stated but not extremely clearly it seems that in the introduction part there s just copy pasted messages from the question statement the flowchart in the introduction part is good but where should this checkbox be implemented it seems that here it should only be implemented in the instructor administrator end instead of students end but that s not clearly stated in the project purpose part the project design is also not very detailed the title do some changes doesn t seems to be very serious but apart from that the implementation details are also copy pasted from the online project requirements the two picture of before and after illustration looks nice enough it s good that the team has found some extra sources that would allow them to get this before and after picture   the testing plan is not stated at all
problem the project purpose is stated in detail in the introduction part starting from the background and problem statement to improve the quality of report views the purpose is stated in five different small goals separately make changes in view submissions view scores view review report author feedback report and teammate review report five different parts in terms of project purpose it s comprehensive and detailed as for project design it is carefully outlined in the solution and modification of files part i think the project design might needs a bit more description in terms of what steps needs to do first and what steps needs to be done next it seems that all the changes are for the ui but is there any ui that can be served as a pattern for the usage of others or is there any implementation of one ui dependent on the implementation of another here i think there needs to be more detailed steps the testing plan includes detailed steps in terms of how to test the implementation as a  end user i like it very much because it is both succinct and very intuitive it will be good to add some sample pictures when the project is over and some pictures that display the functionality becomes available

problem the project is almost on the stage that it can be deployed on the production server however there are few test cases that are failing as shown on the git if these minor flaws are fixed then the code is good to go
problem the project is about adding tests to the a model so this is okay but there is not sufficient background on the model itself more details would be good for the uninitiated   also they mention that the number of tests for the model were not sufficient it would have been better if they would have quoted the code coverage numbers before and after      
problem the project includes the problem statement the team has described the problem statement in detail and has also provided visual aids however the team could have also included the way in which they implement these changes  
problem the project has successfully named it s varables and function names according to the principle they are understandable form what the mean but the project lacks any documentation internally as well as a proper external readme file lack of code documentation makes it tough for the reviewer to make sense of the code apart from that the design of the database schema isn t normalized to much extent which makes data entries redundant

problem the project covers a significant part of the functionality for testing the participant however the biggest problem is that the scores method is commented out from the class assignmentparticipant obviously this will break the existing code that relies on that functionality furthermore the future testing will possibly become complicated because the object under test for participant_spec rb is an instance of assignmentparticipant as opposed to participant

problem the project consists of making a search function to select specific users assignments etc using some criteria so they re creating a search functionality for individual models
problem the project consists of five independent problems the scope of which is well defined in the design document the team provides visual diagrams in the solution descriptions which further improve the explanations of changes the fix for the issue 1008 issue related to staggered deadline is backed up by a discussion about relevant db tables and corresponding part of code one minor improvement would be for the authors to highlight the specific parts of code that are going to be changed in the updated block of code moreover the solution to the issue 1072 issue related to instructor s assignment participation is not specific enough i e it is not clear which structures are going to be affected by the changes all in all the document does a great job in explaining what changes are going to be introduced in the system

problem the newly added code includes the attribute height the getcontext and transfertoimagebitmap method in the offscreencanvas webidl file the name height given for the attribute height for the canvas makes complete sense similarly the name getcontext given for the method that returns the offscreenrenderingcontext is also intuitive the name transfertoimagebitmap is a little long which might be the code less readable if the method is called often instead the accessor convention of using getimagebitmap feels more intuitive and also logical at the same time
problem the newly added code has not yet been accepted in the pull request but it does build the corresponding rust implementation however has not been added and so the test coverage hasn t improved by much
problem the newly added code does not resolve the previous issues to great extent
problem the new design seems to violate the dry principle copying an entire class and then editing it will likely cause problems as you will be using code you did not write and so will not understand as well as your own code this is probably still a better design decision than writing the offscreen canvas from scratch however since it will take less time could you use delegation or extension to dry out the implementation

problem the naming conventions have been followed the professor had frequently asked the team to improve the naming conventions and it seems that the conventions have been properly folowed
problem the names are very intuitive and one can easily understand the reason for each of the variables from their names in addition the test coverage has increased however it is not very good

problem the mock uis are well thought of and make navigation easier a couple of suggestions can add another mock ui showing the drop down some types of reports may not exist if the drop down options are hard coded selecting an option might lead to a page with no content this might be an existing issue i suspect for every option you could query for existence of at least one record before putting that option in the drop down

problem the menu test case violates the dry principle the team can make use of factories to get rid of code redundancy overall good work
problem the manual tests listed should adequately test the functionality but information should be provided on automated testing
problem the main thread behind the design seems to be reusing the existing code which provides the similar functionality this is a great idea it is consistent with the appropriate programming principles e g not reinventing the wheel one suggestion would be for the authors to explain why the instance of the class from which the relevant parts of code are going to be copied is not directly used as  this would be a more dry approach in a case if this is not possible then providing a proper reasoning and justification would be helpful
problem the login page is not made all the admins information is listed on the first page which should not be allowed it was difficult to understand if i was under the admin s page realtor s or hunter s page
problem the login opens the user page which has which has 5 back links for some reason and they do not do anything no common home page for all the list views have to all the list views go from user pages list of companies is not in tabulated form thus very difficult to read
problem the login and sign up page work as expected but the following have changes to be implemented the view is poorly developed admin login credentials are not mentioned so could not test the admin functionality validation for phone number and email id has not been done the system accepts a number which has less than 10 digits and an invalid email id creation of a new house is inside inquiries tab under realtors page which is misleading not able to associate a realtor with a company hence not able to validate the update and delete functionality of a company from inside the realtors page   not able to switch between realtor and house hunter if an user is both delete and update functionalities have not been implemented inquiry creation from house hunter page is not implemented
problem the login signup module seems to be well tested of all the other models and controllers in the program but this module has a drawback it deals with three tables the realtors the househunters and the admin due to this kind of segmentation there is a repetition of data i the database if any user would like to signup as both also it would make it difficult to handle complexity as the application grows according to me its better to atleast cascade the tables of realtors and house hunters into one   the other functionalities are not wholly implemented only the crud operations related to those are implemented hence not much could be reviewed about testing

problem the login signup module has lots of bugs like when a user tries to create an account with an already existing username the application crashes also a user cannot signup as both a realtor and a househunter moreover there isnt any validtion for the length of phone number nor the validation for the email address is correct for example it accepts aa a as a valid email address so yes these functionalities in the login signup module could be improved and these does not seem thoroughly tested but the search functionality for the houses seemed to work pretty well and as expected
problem the logic showed in the design is clear and easy enough but the deign lacks essential details for dealing with reviews
problem the logic in the code looks proper still the code itself is hard to follow primarily because a lot of functionality has been added in a method whose name suggests only partial functionality and no comments have added anywhere examples are in applicatins_controller rb the methods get_realtor_nav_bar and get_hoousehunter_nav_bar make sql queries and other functionalities in houses_controller rb the show method also has a lot code that ideally should not belong in that method i would suggest to put such code in different methods or name the method better do not shy away from creating 10 different methods if need be it organises code much better and simpler to understand

problem the high level design which is needed to start with the work looks prominent as the project proceeds few intricacies resulting due to design conflicts scalability need to be addressed as and when required but the team has laid out a solid foundation to begin with
problem the high level view of the solution appears to be reasonable the problem with this design is that there is no discussion present about any principles or patterns that are going to be utilized as part of the solution i would suggest using certain keywords to make the decisions more clear to the reader for example the authors talk about reusing the code of htmlcanvascontextrendering2d and webglrenderingcontext it would be helpful if the concrete mechanism were specified for example patterns like decorator or adapter would be relevant for this case

problem the explanations are incomplete and do not provide sufficient reasoning
problem the explanations are good separating cases to cases and discuss them one by one is a good strategy   however none of them is explained in detail they are all a little bit terse after reading it i still have the following questions 1 how to change the list_submissions html erb what are the functions that is already implemented the four cases in the explanation did not say clearly whether they are already implemented or not 2 the feature as understood from the past project is that assign grade is present for all teams standardize the functionality i did not quite understand this sentence what s its relation too the four cases proposed here 3 the problem of response controllder checks 2 times and should be reduced to 1 there s not a lot of detailed plan in this implementation

problem the explanation is quite good to tell what is the current and the required functionality the screenshots placed are not complete as in they cut the code at the right end instead i would suggest to placed the github link to the code changes so that the wiki becomes shorter and you can explain each code change better in the wiki also the reviewer can compare the code with your explanation properly if he has the link to the code

problem the explanation is good and they have managed to get in a prototype ui as well my only concern with the design is if there are a lot of assignments the page might become very wide and will require a horizontal scroll bar to access all the data for the user
problem the explanation is descriptive and explains the logic behind the solution which is think should work however i believe that team should can add the explanation about the files and classes they tend to make changes in the team can now focus on implementation of the code

problem the explanation given by the authors was pretty straightforward looking at the explanations it looks like the authors have thought about different aspects of the problem statement and also of different ways to implement the github metrics integration feature along with the side effects of implementing it in a particular way e g one would think that adding the metrics to the database would be a sound solution but given the nature of an open source project and the fact that students would commit beyond the deadline the authors have thought not to add the metrics to the database which is sound and reasonable

problem the  document covers a number of important topics including the description of servo apis and concepts that are going to be used by the team in this project problem statement project build and proposed design however the testing plan is not discussed while the instances of testing is certainly mentioned in the document e g specific functionalities could be tested by writing a custom html file and then running it the similar way and finally we  ll test our code by enabling the blob api the authors do not provide an extensive discussion of specifically what functionality is going to be tested i would suggest reducing the overall size of the initial sections which  provide an overview of servo project off screen canvas web workers and web idl they introduce more verbosity to the  document than necessary two or three descriptive sentences could be used instead the reader could refer to  a more detailed information through references furthermore the focus of the problem statement falls on the description of the offscreencanvas api making it somewhat redundant it would be better to emphasize on flashing out the goal of the project and only later provide the reference to the technical details if necessary another suggestion would be for the team to identify and elaborate on the changes that are going to be merged in servo
problem the document contains a uml use case diagram that analyze the system s requirements and describes the actors involved and the relationship between them it helps to understand the overview of the project details however it can certainly make use of a flow diagram in the expected flow section that gives more clarity about the sequence of actions the flow diagram can follow from the use case diagram to show the tasks performed by the actors in a serial order

problem the designs that the authors have proposed are consistent with the code and do not introduce any obvious problems however the  design decisions for issues 1017 and  1072 are missing and therefore cannot be assessed i would suggest  including the discussion of the specific parts of the source code that  are going to be  addressed  in this project posting the exact solution is not necessary
problem the design sounds good but that s largely due to how vague it is naturally we want to add the things we need to add and remove the things we need to remove
problem the design seems workable maybe they can come up a more sound design for example they can try many ways to define the notification limit
problem the design seems to follow appropriate principles and pattern it is simple and  clearly explains what needs to be done and where the changes will be made suggestion addition of screen mock ups to document will help reviewers a lot

problem the design seems to be sound i would like more details on the database of the bacui projects seeing as most of us don t know what they look like given that most of us have worked on expertiza projects so a short description of the different tables the project is going to interact with along with any and all modifications would really help understand if there will be any possibility that the design would turn out to be non dry or smelly i think the team is good on what gems are to be used
problem the design seems to be good it is still not very clear of the path for implementation or the files that they plan to add and the methods in said files however that is fine considering that this is just the initial stage and not much can be said since we haven t advanced to the implementation stage yet   the authors seem to doubt whether they are allowed to use any existing gem i think they should go ahead and use the gems

problem the design plan portion feels a bit lacking i found myself wanting more detail about how and what they were going to copy between each implementation and the next what s going to be filtered out what s going to be added i have no clue
problem the design looks solid but it s hard to tell without sufficient detail if anything causing every static string reference to be encapsulated into an object that uses the current language to return the correct string is more dry and maintainable than what we have now i wonder if dynamic translation gems are out there or would work the claim that dynamic translation should not be done in this project should be defended e g it would take too much time

problem the design looks good enough it mostly deals with html erb files to accommodate the graph and some database filtering in the controllers i do not think that the design will increase the responses time of the system suggestion if the details regarding how the graph will be implemented or any gem will be used should have been given i did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality that too would have been useful  
problem the design looks a bit complicated and will increase the response time of the system it can make the code smelly too complicated code handled in issue 1 which could be refactored
problem the design lacks dynamic paging for different users all the links are visible to all the users and upon clicking the links an error comes that you are not authorized to perform the action ideally only relevant links should be visible to the user it confuses the user regaring the actions he she can perform the user needs to perform all the actions visible in the ui to know what are the actions relevant for him her the readme file also is not well described about the actions that can be performed by the user the readme file currently lacks any relevant information

problem the design document does not include a test plan as testing requirement  is very minimal since most changes are in view

problem the design document covers  a high level view of the required functionality the concepts and motivations behind offscreencanvascontext2d are extensively discussed moreover the document provides the files  that are going to be changed by the team the main problem of this design is that there is no detailed explanation or examples of what the final expectations are i would suggest giving more specific examples of how the proposed api should work and what may be the main challenges of the implementation
problem the design document contains the project purpose and the changes proposed by the team the design flow gives an overview of the bar graphs that the team plan to generate for selected criterias the introduction section however should largely focus on the project description

problem the design doc contains project purpose project design and testing plan in the wiki the wiki contains mock visualizations which make it easy to understand the project proposal and how are they planning to do the design flow as a flow chart adds to the ease of understanding the test plan explains about the technologies that they are planning to use for testing suggestion   the test plan could say what should be done in testing than just the technologies to be used for a particular part of code for ed we plan to have a dummy small data and see if the graphs output the visualizations correctly if the sum id being counted to 100 of the class participation etc the stacked version could also have been represented for better understanding
problem the design diagram is good and it would also be helpful to have a few screenshots of the current expertiza  view

problem the design changes appear simple and clear only suggestion to the team would be to explain the design choices a little more as mentioned above give an example of how where to use bootstrap and jumbotron
problem the design appears to be specific to the requirements for this they have used a uml design which basically explains the flow of the use case they have not used any principles or design patterns however there does not seem a need to use any as their changes are limited to the html view and making a call to the tablesorter using jquery as per the document the design does not make any redundant changes or unnecessary changes to the code thus they have done a good job by optimizing the changes
problem the design appears to be sound for most part of it the linking between the different sections seems appropriate the only issue i have is with the mock up in the design details second change mock up number 2 i think that the bar chart is being displayed for each and every day i feel that is not only highly unnecessary but also would be very overwhelming for the instructor to process all this information because i it is common knowledge that many students do not begin projects until a few days weeks would have passed since the assignment is posted so that would leave the initial few days of the bar chart empty with nothing valuable to show ii the duration of each project varies from project to project assignment 2 had a duration of about 20 30 days this would mean that there would be about 20 bar charts for each day which would be quite difficult for the ta instructor to process for just one team let alone for so many other teams they need to evaluate suggestions instead of providing bar chart for each day aggregate it to a bar chart for each week or one in 5 days and then maybe towards the deadline or like a week before the deadline you could switch to 1 barchart per day or provide an option to switch between the scaling of time periods like a week 5 days 1 day etc

problem the db design is incomplete although it has the correct 1 to n or n to n relationship it doesn t have any kings of validation  
problem the database schema especially for the login signup functionality is very well implemented and includes lots of features that weren t asked for at the first place so the extra hard work is very well appreciated the db design is very cohesive and seems fool proof the rest of the programs and the functionalities follow most of the principles for good ruby on rails coding practices but the one thing i find missing was the lack of proper documentation within the code given the short time frame not having extensive documentation and comments within the code is excusable but there were certain points where i had to go through the whole code to realize what s happening which could have been avoided if there was proper commenting inside the code  
problem the database schema only consisted of the users table and the crud functionalities on the mvc related to it due to the less amount of content to review a proper justification for this question is a bit tough even though the amount of code was less but it followed many of the good coding practices of ruby on rails except a few for example he code lacked any sort of documentation or comments it makes it tough for the reviewer or any other programmer to make sense of the code but apart from that the practices seemed fine the variables were named appropriately functions were named effectively and the classes were defined definitely  
problem the database handles all the relationships very well on the downside there is a flaw in database design keeping a single user table and single role type means the same email address can not be used for both realtor and house hunter profiles you can either create separate tables or more than one columns to determine if  the same email has more than one role

problem the coverage has increased from 77 to 94 which is impressive however the previous issue was that scores method of  participant was not called because the object  that is being tested in this project is an instance  of assignmentparticipant class this problem was handled by commenting out the scores method of assignmentparticipant so that participant scores method will be called instead   this  breaks other parts of the  code which depend on assignmentparticipant s scores implementation the solution to this problem is to either define a new participant class instance in the factory or to define it in the test code itself

problem the code seems to set up a large list of factories only to then in many cases make these redundant by creating mocks for each test case it is unclear what the code is trying to do and many of the test cases are large with many mocks with stubbed methods it would be helpful if explanation for the code was given when using factories it is generally unnecessary to stub the all the methods of these factories as they are in fact actual instances of the class the code not very dry in many the cases the mocks and stubbed methods could be moved to a before_all or before_each block

problem the code looks very clean i am a big fan of the set up of the describe context it nesting that clearly defines the test cases purpose i am confused why there are two classes being tested in this spec is the purpose of this class to test node or to test menu if two classes are being tested they should perhaps have separate rspec files to make clear the point however the actual syntax and implementation of your tests is beautiful

problem the code is clean and readable but there s only one suggestion the page which lists houses index and search houses are handled by different controllers whereas they could have been easily integrated into one without compromising code readability it would have lead to a more integrated and a cohesive web app in one or two instances there were several functions performed within a function which could have been better modularised too
problem the code is clean and easy to follow and each method handles one task i could not understand the reason for some of the code like the home action in the hunters_controller the current user s role is set to 3 without any checks so if the url  is visited directly and user s role is something else it will be set to 3 and saved which can result in wrong behaviours overall code is well written

problem the code has been written as per the coding standard the code written by the team adheres to dry principle
problem the code has been very well written and it follows all the coding practices there could have been few more comments but other than that i don t see any other problem
problem the code has been modified to include the modifications requested test cases added for failing scenarios and edge cases two assignments with same name in my previous review appreciated overall the code quality is good only some variable names are ambiguous for example check_validate   what does it validate name it like validate_same_name or validate_common_directory etc
problem the code has been merged in a good way and there have been no merge conflicts the build did pass the travis ci the code climate test failed but those were small issues which can easily fixed by just revisiting the code
problem the code has been merged in a good way and there have been no merge conflicts however the travis ci was failing and the code climate check was failing too this is something that the team must look into and make sure that the changes that they have made are consistent with the existing expertiza  code

problem the code has been implemented in a modular way however there are few functions where ruby naming conventions has not been followed for example authenticateadmin in userscontroller class
problem the code has been implemented in a modular fashion however the team can improve the readability of the code in mail_worker  and assignment_form currently it lacks readability because of too long comments between every line of code and poor alignment which makes it difficult for user to understand
problem the code has been implemented as per the ruby standards of coding however there are few instances of code could be better handled such as the index function in admin controller

problem the code has been implemented as per the ruby standards of coding however the author has used numeric ids for role comparison which is difficult to map with the code it would have been more meaningful if the author could use the names of role so that it could be easily understood also it could be more easier for the reader if the author could avoid lot of commented code specially in main classes such as userscontroller instance from code for point 1 if user id 19   current_user role 1   current_user save   else   current_user role 0

problem the code generally is simple and understandable blocks are simple but maybe its because few features are missing

problem the code follows the good coding  practices however there are some instances where i found commented lines of code in the controller ex house_hunters_controller rb  lines 23 25 and users_controller rb  function switch_role
problem the code follows the dry principle and the ruby style guide for writing the test cases the code could be improved by providing comments the code contains optimum length methods and the variables and functions have been properly named
problem the code follows the common ruby on rails application structure hence it was easy for me to navigate through other files to see portion of the code it follows the common mvc structure however in some parts of the code comments were missing which was confusing as i didn t understand the logic for that code readme file was not properly described for other users navigating through app
problem the code follows ruby and rails convention but there are  multiple commented files in the project such as logins coffee and many more which have not been used in the application  
problem the code follows on the lines of good ruby on rails practices however i can see no migrations in the db folder the readme file contains sql statements for table completion which look to be correct

problem the code follows good coding style adheres to naming standards and is dry however the suggested changes since last round have not been implemented which emphasized on shortening the length of long functions create and view
problem the code enables properly testing the various features and describes the system working as desired however since the travis build did not pass the code could be deployed but with careful intervention by the developer it could be taken up from here and does not require to be redone from scratch
problem the code employed good naming and seemed to be dry and follow standard ruby on rails practices the methods were kept short houseinterestlist would make more sense as houseinterest each row in the table is one wish list entry not a list of wish list entries
problem the code does its functionality but it s not tested   my biggest concern would be to have the test cases written for it before the production version   it is a good starting place for a future team to pick up and just cover the test cases

problem the code contributed does not follow the test rule in that the tests are made using create instead of build the code functions do not implement much function and does not follow the ruby style guide the team should focus on getting the tests running by following the dry principle  
problem the code contributed by the author contains long functions which are adequate and consistent considering the amount of task that is carried by each function the team could improve upon the comments to enable high understanding of the flow of code written the code does follow the ruby style guide and supports the dry principle

problem the code contains comments which makes it little hard to read through other than that the organisational way refactoring methods are handled good
problem the code consists of small methods that mostly test one thing this results in high readability the team has made an extensive use of context constructs which further enhance the code documentation moreover the team has improved the sort_by_name method making it cleaner and easier to follow this was  complemented by the fix of bad  names that  were present  in the first round e g stu1 p1 etc one suggestion pertaining to the scores block would be to use specific assertions of fields instead of testing the object via inspect method and comparing it to the string value
problem the code changes in app controllers submitted_content_controller rb line 60 78 could have been in a separate method such as send email to reviewers that would make the controller code clean and clear     code changes does not follow  the dry principle in atleast two places 1   in  app mailers delayed_mailer rb there is no need to duplicate the code the code in the new method   review_reminder_email   has been copied from  email_reminder   the  email_reminder  method can be used instead of creating a separate method altogether   2   app models assignment_participant rb  and  app models course_participant rb  uses a  same code to send the emails via  mailerhelper send_mail_to_user  that can be put in one place so that it can be reused in both the places      
problem the code changes are very less so not much to say about refactoring dry problems etc the code has put statements which are also pointed out by the code climate bot having put conditions is not a good coding style the authors could have considered to remove the statements puts hi im in import puts name to_s the authors could have debugged to see the flow of code or remove them before committing

problem the code changes are accepted but build does not pass travis ci the problem statement is simple and team has implemented a clean solution for the same

problem the code can be readily merged into production 1 i felt code climate failing not an issue because their similar blocks of code were on spec files and deleting 2 different roles is the same functionality in the end few places has indentation errors which can be fixed before merging as suggested earlier removing the error for sql and replacing with some form of alert box could be helpful for a future work
problem the code can be deployed once the travis ci passes and there are some 6 minor warnings to be fixed in code climate there are 4 failing and 1 successful checks the team needs to make sure these checks pass in order to be able deploy the code onto the production server

problem the basics test are written some application specific tests can be written
problem the basic test cases mentioned in the read me work fine it does not cover the edge cases as mentioned above but some of the validations i tried seem to have worked
problem the basic functionalities work nicely creating houses signup and signin house search inquiry and reply etc work correctly all the validations are present however a few functionalities are not working   1   a house without a photo can not be seen error in showing the house 2 houses information index is shown incorrectly forgot to add table headings   3 potential buyer functionality not implemented correctly can not see any details just show edit delete options 4 admin can not delete companies houses or realtors if they are referenced elsewhere see next answer below for details 5 realtor cannot reply to inquiry  and cannot destroy his house 7 admin can not see inquiries even when some are there  
problem the basic functionalities are working as mentioned in the write up refactoring  the code would hamper a few functionalities as there are multiple instances where a single function is performing different actions
problem the bar charts have been added to the design report the visualizations have been added to views also and the screen shots have been added too the only thing that i would like to add is that the bar charts could have been more descriptive as in they could have added details for  x label and y label and also put legend this will aid the user in quickly understanding what the chart is conveying

problem the authors have not specified any implementation specific detail pertaining to the specific controller classes that they propose to modify so i am not in a position to comment if they are making changes in the wrong class or if it will make the code smelly the design looks precise and there is no need of any additional gems   the response time of the system should typically not take so long unless the view is rendering extraordinarily many student and assignment information the team could implement an effective searching algorithm or use of an efficient data structure to store the student grade information or they could possibly use filters to generate only relevant students say under a specific course year at a given university the authors have put in good effort in the design documentation except for minor additions like code modifications file changes and uml diagrams which can be easily incorporated by the next review

problem the authors have just mentioned that they are going to do some testing since it is mostly ui based i would have liked if they could at least give details of steps in each test scenario that could be performed to execute the case even that is missing this section is incomplete and would have liked if the authors could put in more effort and details on how to do this

problem the authors have explained about their changes neatly including previous suggestions they have added detailed description about tablesorter which they plan to implement the tablesorter is used to sort data for multiple fields for a table using multi tbody sorting they plan to use it in the grades and review_mapping views they do not plan to implement in their drop down but display the sorted data itself on loading the page   the changes look more clear to me as they have been able to implement the changes in the table view using multi tbody sorting for submissions table i think that introduction to expertiza is highly unnecessary and should be removed

problem the application has really come a long way from the previous submission i believe most of the page routes follow an appropriate application flow there are several of the dependencies that are evidently not implemented do to the following observations 1   users are able to assign him herself a real estate company that doesn t exist in the system this assignment should only be made with existing companies to fulfill the requirement of mapping a realtor to a single company this missing dependency also reflects in the creation of houses realtors are able to create houses that are not listed with the company that the realtor is associated with this association should be automatically made according to the company assigned to the realtor 2 users can be both a hunter and a realtor at the same time and can switch back and forth how do you differentiate between a users abilities probably the best option would be to only allow users to be either a house hunter or a realtor that would eliminate some of the ambiguities is associations and some unnecessary profile fields like house hunters having a real estate company 3 inquiries are not associated with houses this posses an issue with knowing what property the house hunter is requesting information about overall there have been great advances in your application since the first submit continue implementing those dependencies so that the required associations can hold

problem suggested changes related to naming convention are not included in the 2nd round   variable names rop_topic_deadline1 topic_id1 puts statements are not removed p topic_id1   other than this the code is properly written following coding best practices  
problem success in edge case testing is determined by the association of the module to self or with other modules many edge cases in this application are dependent on relationships between modules for example because houses are not properly associated with realtors or companies reassigning a realtor s company appears to have no affect administrators are not able to  delete users or companies but  i would image it would not throw an error there are cases that i tested that dealt specifically around the models example user accounts can be created with the same email accounts as long as they are of different user types   this and other edge cases of it type proved successful it would be great to have edge case information listed in the readme to clarify how these cases were dealt with again implementing the necessary dependencies between models will help to eliminate many of these edge case issues

problem scenarios that are discussed in the wiki have comprehensive descriptions and justifications however clearly a number of edge cases are not considered as the test coverage is 77   i would suggest using mock objects which will both decouple tests from database and increase the overall coverage   for example mocking find_by method of teamsuser would allow covering participant team case allow teamsuser to receive find_by with user student and_return team   another minor issue is that wiki is missing some cases that are implemented in the code team fullname scores

problem on checking the code we find that in agreement with travisbuddy the code had a build error which seems to be unresolved which is strange and should have been looked into moreover the overall coverage shows a good amount of increase which is good but one must say that the details in the code changes as few as they seem have been to a good extent for the majority of the part and thus worth the merit

problem on checking the pull request it shows the travis ci check has failed
problem of the functionality the team have tried to to implement the code quality is not poor however the arrangement of code is difficult to understand given that not all functionalities seem to have been implemented the def after_sign_in_path_for function in the applications controller used by the devise gem only takes realtor as a resource i would advise using an if or case condition within the function to allow other users to login also i was unable to find any implementation for making sure that only the inquiries specific to a real estate company be visible to a realtor and similarly only the inquiries posted by a house hunter themselves be visible to the house hunter on that specific house i would again suggest using some if or case statements in the show function of the inquiries controller to establish identity of current_user

problem not only does the build fail with multiple errors the overall coverage is shows a significant decrease instead of an increase which is a real cause of concern moreover the number of commits even though impressive does include a lot of minimalistic changes which one does beg to question the necessity of but that s still fine since i am assuming that the complexity of the code may require so many commits but still adding a line break as a commit i am unsure if its a great way to go about it

problem nope they have errors in their build too as indicated by travis ci and this is the error message output by it   hey  ppvasude something went wrong with the build travisci finished with status  errored which means the build failed because of something unrelated to the tests such as a problem with a dependency or the build process itself on checking the build logs i found that they errors in bundle install stage itself resulting from missing gems which they haven t resolved as a part of second submission

problem nope the last commit still shows from 12 days ago which is the time period even before the first submission overall the branch is 3 commits ahead and 20 commits behind the expertiza master even so conclusively going by their git hub their last commit was before the first submission and hence no commits in the second submission
problem nope again they did not mention a lot about how they test but what they have done
problem none of the tests travis ci code climate have passed
problem none of the relationships are handled with the built in has_one has_many or belongs_to functionality except the user model which randomly belongs_to realestate
problem none of the models specify any belongs_to or has_many relationship and no migrate nor schema stores an official reference to be used
problem none of the functions are too long could find changes where dry principle was violated the code follows ruby convention and guidelines although the code is easy to follow the team needs to add comments for the changes which is currently missing good job

problem no this is not standards to add colors in the respective element it becomes very hard to maintain or modify such changes in future it would be better to move the style to a scss file and use a class ui to make this change which is clean and dry
problem no they were no commits during round 2

problem no i do not think the code is ready to be deployed i found the code change hard to understand there are no comments and neither has the logic or rationale behind the new changed code been given in the wiki besides the build fails and there are a host of issues that  need to be fixed   although all this might only be trivial issues and can be fixed rather easily the code as of now is not deployment ready  according to me

problem no the team hasn t committed  any changes during the second round the last commit was on 31st october 2018
problem no the team has not been diligent in specially making a section of what it does as the introductory section of the doc so as to make us understand the goals of the project they have seemed to not even make a wiki page for the same or have seemed to forget to upload it because how am i supposed to follow the approach and solution of the problem if there doesn t exist any documentation to check for the same    
problem no the team has not been diligent in specially making a section of what it does as the introductory section of the doc so as to make us understand the goals of the project they have just copy pasted the problem statement on the wiki page in a single paragraph even that statement seems to have been incompletely pasted in just a single paragraph so it highly unclear what they are doing i had to open the projects assignment doc of the professor to try to make sense out of the motivation of the problem  
problem no the team did not add any test cases and the coverage did not increase the overall decrease was 13 6 to 34 007
problem no the strange part is the code hasn t been committed during the second round it is strange because they have surely seem to have achieved all their requirements to problems going by the wiki page so why haven t they committed the new changes is the question  
problem no the readme file tells me what i should do to test in local computer and does not offer admin s information or any instruction of how to operate when login to the website
problem no the readme file is an auto generated file and there is no details in it

problem no the build for the pull request does not pass the build had 4 jobs out of which 2 jobs passed successfully however 2 build jobs have errors first  job failure is related to webdriver error for chrome where test fails second job failure is related to nomethoderror for method
problem no the build did not pass it seems that airbrake_expection_errors_feature_tests_spec rb has some problem
problem no the build did not pass in travis ci several checks were failed but there was no conflict with the base branch
problem no the build did not pass in travis ci several checks had failed but there was no conflict
problem no the authors didn t improve the code
problem no that doesn t seem to be the case since it has been a very jumpy approach and also the functionality of only a basic login has been added so if adding the bare login and sign up is considered as an mvc architecture then they have surely built a bare backbone of it

problem no testing portion of the code seems empty no testing has been done
problem no testing is not covered yet
problem no since no write up or no wiki page exists it is clearly not possible to ascertain any of the above clauses    
problem no one of the functionalities of the test plan is not yet done
problem no not really the website just has one role to operate and the readme file is an auto generated file which doesn t include any useful information
problem no not really no user type has all the functionality in this review s check boxes much less all the functionality specified in the project description manual inspection of the test folder reveals that all the model and controller tests are empty as are the fixtures
problem no not really first of all   i still cannot login in as admin according to the account and password offered in readme file so i cannot see what could happen when i log in as an admin even though a hunter can put an inquiry for a house but the realtor are not able to reply it however compared to the commitment in round 1 they have made a lot of improvements but the admin part is still falling
problem no not really the design is does not implement the test plan but rather goes on to show how the pre existing expertiza algorithm works so it would help if they showed the same

problem nicely implemented code used ruby delegations appropriately and the code is very readable   however a few things can be improved   for eg in inquiriy_replies_controller flash is used to transfer data from the new method to the params method which is not the correct way also i believe that the implementation can be made more efficient by reducing the number of database hits for example in almost all the controllers there are redundant database hits   user find session id role_type buyer could have been identified during login a second hit to identify the role type or any such info can be avoided for a small test database this would not show any performance decrease but as the records increase the pages will become exponentially slower     maybe you can store these in memory session which would reduce time taken significantly at a small memory overhead
problem nice work implementing image upload for houses i found some functionalities missing after deleting a company an error page shows up instead of a valid page also sometimes the company does not get deleted company edit link goes to home page instead of edit form realtor can create a house even though s he has no company interest list page for hunter loads page does not exist

problem naming is good there are few names eg is_selfreview_enabled which don t seem fine but they were from before any thing new that has been added by them follows proper naming convention

problem it seems that some of the associations were attempted 1 real estate company contains many users and houses and 2 house belongs to a real estate company and a user these relationships are currently commented out so the dependencies are not enforced there are additional connections missing such as the users model where a realtor should belong to only a single company and many houses the implementation seems incomplete but the idea found within the company and house models is moving in the right direction

problem it seems evident that there are deletion issues for any resource user that is already indexed on some other resource user the solution to that issue would be    adding a destroy dependency in model files for example for house hunters   has_many  inquiries   dependent destroy

problem it is surely a very intuitive user interface because the ease of navigation is generally very well defined and the routes rb file in git hub makes the session linkage explicit   even so one does fail to understand the empty blanks on their login page since there aren t any blanks at all so we get easily confused on what to do sign up is not validated for any functionality be it user or admin or realtor and we don t know what to do   luckily the readme file does resolve the dilemma and help us to follow the steps

problem it is given in wiki that most of your test cases depend on checking the output however like i mentioned in my last review several test cases like the ones mentioned below can be automated this is especially true as tdd is explicitly mentioned in your problem statement write the required tests before implementing refactoring the methods in the above mentioned classes add past due assignments to the student  s task list on student view check for correction in due dates of assignments when an assignment  s due date is edited it should be appropriately moved from the   past assignments  list to the   current assignments  list if needed on student task page separate the list of teamed with students from the current tasks box

problem it is a testing project which aims at improving test coverage so production deployment is not in question however before merging the code to master branch here are a few recommended changes 1 adding comments to improve readability and understanding for future use 2 avoid using comments like i swear this is the last one they do not explain anything about what you changed from your last commit and why proper professional comments are expected all these comments should be refactored
problem it included a proper test plan there was no test plan included in the previous version of the design document but authors have added it in the second round which made the design document complete

problem issue 1201 in the assignments_controller code the team has checked in a puts statement line 48 which looks like debug code even though these are helpful during the development phase we need to remove them before finally pushing them issue 391 the comment assignments_controller rb 85 is not descriptive enough the author has commented out a method call it would be beneficial to the person reading the code to understand the intention behind this please provide a detailed comment on why this was done again the author has use a puts statement _submitted_files html erb 29 which should not be committed and should only be used during development debugging please remove the debug code
problem issue 1201 below is the change made in _general html erb directory name will be autogenerated if not provided in the form of assignment name_id_course_id the last part could be modified to something with a bit more clarity from the assignments_controller code it could be seen that the auto generated directory name follows the format assignment name _ assignment id _ course_id which is not what is specified in the text there is a typo in the word autogenerated it needs to be hyphenated as auto generated

problem in the first round the team had only created the two web idl  files namely offscreencanvas webidl and offscreencanvasrenderingcontext2d webidl which are the interface files which define the implementation in the corresponding files offscreencanvas rs and offscreenrenderingcontext2d rs in this round the team has implemented the functionalities described in the two web idl files in offscreencanvas rs and offscreenrenderingcontext2d rs the offscreencanvas rs interacts with the javascript and hence has the constructor with attributes height and width a method getcontext to return the reference to offscreencanvasrenderingcontext2d and a reflector object for garbage collection the offscreenrenderingcontext2d rs file does not interact directly with javascript and does not have a constructor or reflector object it has the code to build the offscreencanvas object   on inspection the variable and method names used in the code are intuitive but the main issue is that the name of the webidl file offscreencanvasrenderingcontext2d webidl and corresponding rust file offscreenrenderingcontext2d rs don t match the team could have formatted the code appropriately for readable indentation there are not many comments that give a high level description of the code instead there are some instances of unnecessary code that has been commented the code is indeed dry

problem in general the code of this system is in a clean and readable and written in the mvc way but there are some problems in the code for example in the realtor controller there is no method to handle the join action when a realtor wants to join in a new company and a realtor can not receive a inquires from hunter besides in the models folder i seems redundant to me role users and users_roles making reader easily confused
problem in general the code of this system is clean and readable but there are some problems in it for example author didn t handle the interest list properly when a realtor wants to see the potential buyers of a house it does not mean he wants to see all the hunters registered in the system besides the realtor can not edit his own profile can change real estate company because the edit method in the controller is not realized and in models some relationships shouldn t appear because one of the model is not created such as the model house_hunters which has many queries but the model query is not created

problem in general the code seemed to look fine there were some really long methods like in the users_controller class so i docked a star there was a separate method for adding to interest list
problem in due_date_color switch case would have been a better approach  then if else if block lots of code that is done in view  can be moved to the controller follow mvc architecture

problem in documentation it mentions participant rb model file is changed to for increasing code coverage however the file is missing in the pull request generated there is no mention about changes in the assignment_participant rb file but that is present in the pull request it may be a name mismatch or some files are indeed missing i pointed it out during the first review but changes are not incorporated currently the code overall looks good proper variable names are used commenting is required

problem if company is delete the house will also disappear and the realtor need to find a new company but the readme does not cover edge cases
problem if as a realtor i am trying to update my profile where i only change my company to a random company  abc it is updating just fine which i believe should not be done because the company doesn t exist and is not even being added to the company list as a new company couldn t check any of the admin s functionality couldn t  sign up as a realtor
problem if admin tries to delete company corresponding houses gets deleted similarly association between inquiry  and other models handled well system goes into error when we try to create house without images though houses gets created multiple times realtors login team could probability add null check for empty references  
problem if a company is deleted the realtor and houses doesn t get deleted and if a house gets deleted the inquires are not getting deleted

problem i was unable to judge if this works there was no way for me to determine that the admin can not delete companies can not view edit or delete realtors or househunters also users cannot delete themselves   further the third party admin gem or module  used does not let me edit or delete users or companies either it gives an error on heroku   thus i was unable to determine if the edge cases work also readme does not specify anything

problem i think user experience and code readability are as imp as producing a working code so based on how urgent is the requirement for this functionality i would prioritize refactoring the notices and display messages to more appropriately indicate what action was taken when we try to add a participant to the assignment or import using a csv file secondly improving the comments as explained with an example in the first question
problem i think this team did not correctly implement several database relationships   for instance a house does not have many users it has a single realtor the realtor who posted it and it might have many interested users potential buyers but that should have been via a through relationship another example is inquiries an inquiry has one user for one house not many users and many houses

problem i think that the authors have identified changes in the html erb files which looks right to me as it only deals with the sorted view of instructor reports the changes must go in the views part of the application   suggestion you can try to add a bit of information on whether your changes include addition of new code deletion of existing code or just slightly modifying or extending the existing code and justify it query do you plan on creating  a drop down like option to choose from which type of sorting is to be performed if yes it is an add on user friendly feature

problem i cannot access the link provided by the team since this is hosted on aws i believe they have not opened the ip to public by mistake i have worked with aws before and this happens maybe they worked from library or their house and when you spawn an instance in aws it adds the ip from where the instance is spawned to the access list which is why i am not able to access this from my ip this can also be a problem with the proxy server setup in the instance and since you guys are maybe doing ssh into the server to deploy your code the default http request will go to port 80 and wont be forwarded to 8080 unless explicitly specified in apache nginx and will block the requests easier way would be to host the app on heroku which handles all this automatically and provides you with a dns entry

problem good explanation of the proposed changes you may want to add it in a separate heading overall explanation quality is adequate
problem good description i think with the use of headings and subcategories it will look good also need lot of conteent to mention the changes done
problem good coding practice followed

problem function names look good and most of them have len 20 which is good   the tests make use of contexts effectively this is great to see     yes more comments are required especially in the controller code telling why an approach was taken and what the function does

problem function length is good general convention of having function length 20 has been followed what i found lacking was additional 2 3 lines of comments before each new function to understand what has been implemented      
problem from what i see it looks like code we have seen in class although in the model classes they don t have any associations between models
problem from what i can gather nothing sounds too complicated individually but the practice of a workflow across multiple pages can become very  cumbersome and complex i don t see any details on how this team plans to mitigate those issues

problem from the code db design looks fine they have handled most of the relationships properly although i believe having different tables for admins realtors hunters users roles and role maps is un necessary and just increases the complexity of the system  
problem from my previous review of this project there have been few additions to the set of functionalities implemented for the 3rd project oss the team had worked on  offscreencanvas rs interacts with javascript and  offscreencanvascontextrendering2d rs works on offscreencanvas which are implementations of  offscreencanvas webidl  and    offscreencanvascontextrendering2d webidl  web idl files respectively in this project the team has proposed to implement  offscreencanvas analogous to  htmlcanvascontextrendering2d by reusing some code from the latter and add additional functionalities they finally propose to implement blob api to test the contents on the canvas and also support webgl contexts as used in  webglrenderingcontext

problem for the first two issues the team gave different conditions but no codes or demos are presented in the wiki for this test i can only know the results by the description for the later issues the team gave the comparison between the old version and new version which is easy to understand
problem for the manage participant part the authors didn t explain how will they solve the issue that the add student button cannot work correctly after a user add a course the document included other changes need to be made but the explantation was not clear enough the design used a lot of components in bootstrap but the authors didn t give any explantations to these components they would use and didn t give any diagrams to show what the changes will be like
problem for sign up i don t understand what is the difference between i am shopping for a house and i am a realtor and i am shopping for a house

problem for each problem the authors display relevant chunks of code and discuss which parts need to be changed aside from the issue 1072 all the solutions seem reasonable and simple one minor suggestion for improvement would be to use the collect instead of the each method for computing total_weight in validate_assignment_questionnaires_weights method
problem for each method there should be multiple test cases but they put all tests for a method together wrap by a single it do they should consider to add more it do to separate each test case so the reader know what are they testing

problem design does seem to be sound but complex as mentioned in the earlier review i am unsure if looping over each review is the correct thing to do or not maybe the team discussed this with the mentor and decided against it as no new information has been added in the document if so i would only suggest the team to include the complexity of the design in the  document

problem code in the model methods looks very clean attribute symbols are appropriately validated and proper constraints are applied to measure uniqueness the controller code has great parenthesis and bracket use for function calls and assignments more consistent spacing of functions and function content would aid in the readability of the code also there are a few instances where conditional blocks are empty if there is no purpose for the block it should be removed example found in the static page controller overall the code seems to implement good ruby style standards  
problem code has been submitted frequently
problem code had a few guideline misses which was noted and suggested by the automated tool on pull request

problem changes to application continued throughout the second round of project submissions many of the commits deal with the adding additional functionality to the company controller as well as additions to the readme i can see that good work was made toward implementing missing functionality from the first round of submission
problem changes proposed by authors are good but they are explained in detail
problem changes proposed are adequate but without any reference to code or design diagrams its hard to tell if the proposed solution will work it is always better to investigate the code instead of writing states such as this maybe the legacy code is in two places hence the two calls

problem as this project is in the early stages of development the ui is minimal the title is prominently displayed as a header on the home page and subsequent pages to clearly indicate what this application is real estate manager the login and signup links are clear as to purpose however the intent in the presence of the words hello world beside  them is unclear additionally the login and signup page functionalities are easily interpreted i would suggest that the user profile actually display what kind of user they are rather than a number that only has meaning to the system as well as a log out link button in the header for a user as he she traversed your application the readme file only contains the fact that there is no pre configured administrator i would recommend including the suggested context from the ruby generator and the project write up

problem as its a test project deployment to production may not be applicable the code can be merged but i would suggest few changes to dry the code as the test seems slow which is a scope for improvement
problem as it did not pass the test it is not ready for a future team end of this project should be a good starting place
problem as i said early the images are very very large and don t fit unless i have the wiki full screen also finding the changes from the original is a bit tricky  
problem as given in wiki for their test plan   the admin tests include building and deleting both administrator and instructor accounts using capybara for testing the front end web functionality it delete instructor successfully do it delete admin successfully do to test the role creation capybara was again used to check that the web page did not have any button for new role and that navigating to the page manually resulted in an error it should not create a new role and redirect to index page when new method is called do   although they havent explained the edge cases and negative inputs in the wiki their test cases cover whatever has been discussed
problem as for the designs proposed by the authors it proves to be substantial since there is a good amount of design aspect in their doc   sure they have defined an application flow but that is all there is to it   1 nothing about adding a method to any class has been suggested implementation section is left blank   2 the design hasn t been implemented to the depth to make it a code let alone make it smelly   3 nothing mentioned about the design to make it complicated and the piece of code which they would delve into to ascertain of any pre existing gems for simplification   4 this too is hard to reach a conclusion on since not enough details to answer it with certainty   5 yes absolutely a much more thorough investigation should be carried out and relevant previous work exploration with help solve the cause

problem although as per the scope of the project the team did extremely well all implementations as written in the project description were completed however i feel that this project in general has more scope say introducing email notifications to the students when a review is due as far as the work of the team is concerned they completed everything that was asked of them
problem although as per functionality this code is ready to be merged and the team did put in a fair amount of work into it still i believe this project can be bettered by another team in the future by refactoring some the code to improve code writing principles and also improve the wiki documentation

problem along with the above improvements some of the things you might want to take care of are even if a company is deleted the houses and inquires remain as it is partial reason is the above bug which allows to create a house and post reply without being associated to any company when i try to delete a house it shows application error so not able to test if dependent child records for potential buyers and house hunters are deleted or not   for realtor and househunter signup it should be allowed to signup without specifying company or other details except name email password as per the usecase given this is not allowed currently

problem almost 80 85 of the features are covered dual role  implementation is missing not working signup doesn t give an option to register as both realtor and hunter at the same time input validations are not handled remove from interest list option is missing ideally once the user clicks on add to interest list button the button should be changed to remove from interest list admin didn t have the delete option for all the users listed this needs to be fixed a realtor was not given an option to edit the details of the house he she has listed only photo adding feature was there

problem all the basic scenarios are working fine no issues or problems were found with the functionality there is an issue related to the ci built which is failing at the moment the team needs to analyse the root cause related to the build failure and fix it also the scenario where the ta is assigned to a instructor what will happen to the instructors impersonated students when the ta of the constructor login to the application the scenario could not be tested as the same is missing from video and the application is not deployed other than that it was a great team effort

problem actually the design seems not simple due to the ambiguous of the design i cannot tell clearly what the four links are used to do in the first step but it seems too many links will be used and some strange conditions need to be checked before instructors can perform a review in addition it seems not all the instructors can do the reviews so there may be some errors description for step 2 is also complex and seems include a lot of jobs need to do

problem actually all these edge cased list above are not realized at all   and the mapping relationships between the models don t work at all for example when i delete a real estate company and i look back to realtors list nothing happened because the company id in the realtors list looks like some random number such as a company id 6 which is not appear in the company list and so does the house list

problem a huge improvement from round 1 in round one not much code was submitted so this is a huge improvement keep it up i have a suggestion it is very important to have comments in the code which will help other readers understand your code or in this case understand what you have tested without having to look for any other documentation which explains it code file should be self sufficient
problem a flowchart and graph has been shown in the documentation   suggestions i feel that there should have been mockups of the screens where the functionality will actually appear team should have shown how the solution would look like on the expertiza page there could have been use case diagrams too  
problem a flow chart is depicted in the documentation however other uml diagrams could have been represented  to show the structure and the sequence of the project the flow chart depicted is a little  high level the total capacity  of the project could have been represented by more uml diagrams

problem a few tests were added though i d like to see more tests regarding edge cases or invalid functionality  
problem a few comments could be included in code to make it more clear
problem a few changes to functions and their declaration have to be made to make the code production ready
problem a detailed explanation would have been better

problem 1 no they have modularized well 2 no 3 they could have provided more comments on tests where they set nodes at few places 4 they could have used factories more extensively due to various mock data they might have needed to cover different inputs 5 their code can be more dry as they seem to repeat instantiations in all places

problem 1 when an admin deletes a company which has existing realtors it shows on the admin page that the company is deleted but when the realtor signs in it still shows that he belongs to the deleted company and is able to update all the profile information of the company so it means the company is not being deleted even when it says so on the admin page 2 the realtor isn t able to view any houses except his own company 3 no the inquiries are not auto deleted nor is the househunter removed from potential buyers list
problem 1 unable to login as admin 2 realtor can delete houses but houses don t seem to map to a real estate company rather they are mapped to the realtor only 3 unable to login as admin
problem 1 admin can delete real estate companies with realtors attached to it 2 realtor is being able to delete any house 3 admin can delete house hunter with several enquires
problem 1 what will happen if the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses it deletes it successfully       2 what will happen if a realtor changes his her real estate company will s he be prohibited to remove the houses s he listed in the previous company no houses are easily changed and can be deleted by realtors     3 what will happen if admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries will the inquiries be automatically deleted if this house hunter is a potential buyer of a house will s he be removed from the corresponding potential buyers list   it cannot be removed if inquiries are pending     4 you can come up with more edge cases if the system fails in some edge cases explain with enough details most of the functionalities i checked such as creating a house putting inquiries removing various users looking back in different accounts if it removes such as inquiries if user has still submitted or pending inquiries all works fine  
problem 1 what will happen if the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses houses got deleted and realtor got assigned with some other random company   2 what will happen if a realtor changes his her real estate company will s he be prohibited to remove the houses s he listed in the previous company house also got changed to realtor s new company   3 what will happen if the admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries will the inquiries be automatically deleted   cascade delete  is in place
problem 1 what will happen if the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses can t be tested 2 what will happen if a realtor changes his her real estate company will s he be prohibited to remove the houses s he listed in the previous company no realtor is still allowed to delete houses 3 what will happen if admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries will the inquiries be automatically deleted if this house hunter is a potential buyer of a house will s he be removed from the corresponding potential buyers list cannot be tested 4   delete a house in a house hunter s interest list and see if it still appears there works as expected

problem   you can not destroy any real estate company realtor or househunter as admin with any realtor house or inquire it will just throw an error you can have negative floors for house readme file does not tell anything about edge cases
problem   yes they have improved the uml diagram from last round and it  s a standard class uml diagram it  s very self explanatory though the diagram under test plan should be clearer also there could have been a sample report generated for reference

problem   the functionalities that the authors plan to add seem logical as they plan to implement offscreencanvas as an efficient alternative to htmlcanvas but with all the functionalities included   the authors have not discussed about the implementation of the proposed design yet which i am expecting them to do in the next review the response time is expected to decrease with the incorporation of offscreencanvas because the rendering of the images in the canvas is done independently using web workers  
problem the fixes required part has been explained well with the cause of the issues but more light  could be shed on what the formative and summative rubrics are
problem   the features work however the notice messages could be improved to state exactly the action that is conducted eg one of the notice message says either user is already added or it doesn t exist narrowing it down will be of great value

problem   can not test functionalities
problem   as the project is based upon making changes to the ui of the system thus there is no such specific pattern being followed however the design that they have made available in the form of screenshots appear very much inclined with the functionalities that they need to implement
problem   all the names and methods look reasonable but some of the function size is still long
problem   all the major functionalities work and most of them work however there are a couple of bugs that could be solved after submitting a inquiry and clicking back the user is redirected to the page where all the messages in the database are shown the realtor is not able to view the potential buyers for any house the look and all the major functionalities are running smoothly great work on that  
problem   again its fine i don t understand the changes too well but i also don t understand mvc and expertiza very well either but maybe they could have tried harder i do feel there is a strong need to refactor and improve the code quality of expertiza

problem   yes they have a test section the amount of coverage added for the new tests is great keep it up however i would have liked that the authors added more negative cases as part of t heir unit tests   i see mostly the ve test cases being handled in the tests

problem   the test plan has covered test cases for testing functionalities of sorting submissions table and review mappings per field they can also include test plan for the edge cases of the system like the code should not break when the submissions table is empty and show should probably display a flash message saying no entries to be sorted in this way try to add a few negative testing to improve your coverage this will make your code more rigid

problem   the design is perfectly well depicted in the form of the use case diagram in which the users are student and instructor and the data base is where the actions are stored in the database and the retrieved from the same for the case of reviews information   also they have been thorough in pointing out the application flow in the application flow section so as to elucidate the problem statement  
problem   the authors have done a good job by identifying the sub classes they plan to add it would be good to have an overview of the class definitions it is quite clear from the explanation that they plan to have different tasks depending upon the type of report to be removed

problem   i could not see any test plan team could work on writing test plan and implementing  the same for the issues resolved also where team is failing to implement some functionality as future scope they can try design the solution and also test cases for the same
problem   convert  if  nested inside  else  to  elsif unused variable  key inside remove_non_utf8 method    
problem   1 it seems that something is wrong with admin login functionality as i am not able to sign in as an admin with the provided credentials thus i am unable to test this edge case  2 due to missing functionality of realtor being associated to a company i am unable to test this edge case 3   it seems that something is wrong with admin login functionality as i am not able to sign in as a user 4 there is no potential buyer s list hence cannot test this edge case
problem yes the team has covered the high level implementation changes to be made to the system we get the gist of the files that might be changed and what is end goal to be achieved though it  s not very clear what is the change to be made under   separation of concerns  section which could have been explained better

problem yes the code was extremely clean and readable the naming represented the task such as   remove_from_interest_list show_potential_buyers etc  of the method and no extra load was carried by that method except for the action assigned to the method   no methods were longer than necessary and no unnecessary nesting was present though not major a suggestion for the team is to avoid using pronouns or subjective references such as  my_interest_list and houses_posted_by_me for method naming also as methods are referred to as actions naming should reflect an action so add show in front of naming such as houses_posted_by_company

problem there is no problem statement mentioned in the design document it directly dives into the implementation details this does not help the reader is understanding the need for a project there is no test plan project purpose the team has tried to provide a design implementation details which is not very descriptive more effort is needed to enable reader to understand the design better          
problem the team has partially handled the relationships has_many they have aptly provided all the has_many relationships such as realestatecompany has many houses relators a house hunter has many interest and inquiry etc one more relation should have been a relator has many houses under him most of these relations are bi directional associations so there should ideally have been a belongs_to relation such as if a company has many realtors then a relator belongs_company is an association no such relations are found in code also as the realtor can only be linked to one company at a time this calls for a has_one relation
problem the team has efficiently described the problem statement and the need for undertaking such a project good effort as it talks about refactoring few more lines on the pain points of current design would have helped a great deal in appreciating the project the design selection is great apt to the problem and the uml diagram to visualize it is helpful the uml diagram should have been more descriptive on how the current code is to be modified to incorporate the proposed design pattern as it was not easily to know if this pattern would fit the current code test plan is missing

problem i don  t see a test available for controller or model in the code and as its not documented whether a different type of test implementation is available i am marking this unavailable

problem all basic functionality outlined by the test suite is working as expected with few corner case bugs the filter functionality should have been more flexible to filter for a range of price and sq ft rather than try to match exact numbers provided which is not user friendly also the realtor signup should allow realtor to choose company from list available which is more user friendly
problem 1         the diagram provided is a generalization for strategy pattern and more aligned to help give a simpler outlook 2         the standards are not followed as it should indicate the class type as an interface and the method implementations needed in the concrete classes 3         the uml is high level indication more project specific diagram is needed
